Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call within an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We delivered another strong quarter, as the power of our global platform, as well as, the depth and breadth of our digital ecosystems are translating into sustainable growth, including record net bookings, stable yields, and healthy interconnection activity. Our bookings momentum in cloud and enterprise reflects our position, as a key enabler, of IT transformation. Cloud service providers are choosing platform Equinix to scale their infrastructure globally, and enterprises are increasingly turning to us, as a partner in adopting hybrid and multi-cloud, as part of their next-generation IT architectures.","As depicted on slide three, revenues were $686.6 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter, and up 17% over the same quarter last year, on a normalized and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $321.5 million for the quarter, up 3% over the prior quarter, and up 20% year-over-year, on a normalized and constant currency basis, delivering a 47% margin. AFFO grew 17% year-over-year, on a normalized and constant currency basis to $210.4 million. With 169,000 cross-connects, and 4 terabytes per second of traffic, on our Internet Exchanges, which are growing at 33% year-over-year. Equinix is benefiting from the strong secular trends, and momentum, as businesses are becoming increasingly interconnected.","A recent industry survey of over 1,000 CIOs and other IT leaders globally, showed the number of enterprises deploying direct interconnections is poised to more than double, to over 80% by 2017. Enterprises that have already moved to interconnected solutions, reported significant value creation, from enhanced application performance, and cost savings. Clouds continue to be the fastest growing interconnection destination at Equinix, although strong growth was delivered from all ecosystems. We added a record 7,000 cross-connects this quarter and revenue from interconnection grew 21% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, meaningfully outpacing overall revenue growth as we mature our ecosystems and penetrate new markets.","Our digital exchanges saw another quarter of record traffic in provision capacity growth, including the addition of a 172 ports on our Internet Exchanges. This includes 24, 100-gig ports doubling the provision capacity added in any previous quarter, and an important reflection of the confidence our customers have in our Internet Exchanges and our role in connecting network traffic. We expect continued traffic growth as this 100-gig capacity is absorbed into peering architectures.","Internationally, we are augmenting strong organic growth with our planned acquisitions of Bit-isle and Telecity to build market leadership, increase capacity, enhance cloud and network density and grow customer ecosystems across Europe and Asia.","Turning to slide four, as announced in September, we are acquiring Bit-isle, a co-location leader in Japan for approximately $280 million. Japan is one of the world's largest co-location markets and for several years, Equinix has been evaluating how to accelerate our leadership in this market. With this acquisition, Equinix will become the fourth largest data center operator in Japan.","Bit-isle's facilities are adjacent to our carrier dense sites in Tokyo and Osaka, giving us customer ready capacity as well as the opportunity to scale platform Equinix in this increasingly constrained but important global market. Bit-isle also complements our cloud and network service provider customer base with a strong Japanese enterprise and systems integrator customer set, including some of Japan's largest companies. With Bit-isle, Equinix also adds strong local expertise to help drive success in Japan and we look forward to completing this transaction in the fourth quarter.","Turning to the Telecity acquisition, we're excited about this compelling and unique opportunity to expand our presence in key markets in Europe, delivering significant value to our global interconnection platform. Regarding regulatory status, we are seeking approval from the European Commission and we have had ongoing dialog over the past several weeks to review the transaction.","Based on those discussions, we have proceeded with a formal offer to the Commission with proposed commitments, which are now being market tested. We expect to hear a response by November 13 and are of the view that this transaction should be cleared during its phase one review, based on those commitments. Our pre-close work streams are progressing well and will remain on track for a first half 2016 close.","In addition to our acquisitions, the Equinix global platform continues to grow organically as customers leverage our broad geographic reach to deploy applications that serve their employees, partners, and customers across the world. Today, 54% of our revenue comes from customers deployed globally across all three regions, and over 83% is from customers deployed across multiple metros, a reflection of our differentiated global reach.","We continue to invest in international markets to meet growing global demand and seek critical business ecosystems that will deliver incremental growth and value. We're currently building across 12 metros worldwide, focusing on our investments, where we can deliver a differentiated offer and generate very attractive returns. Globally, we have 13 announced expansion projects underway, of which 12 are campus builds or incremental phased builds, which helps mitigate risk while driving returns.","We continue to increase the number of owned data centers, including purchasing the land for our new build in S\u00e3o Paulo. Owned properties now generate 38% of recurring revenue and 39% of NOI. And over 93% of NOI is generated by owned or leased properties or lease expirations extended to 2029 or beyond.","Shifting gears, let me address our continued investment in green technology. We believe it is our responsibility to power the digital economy in an environmentally sustainable way, both to serve the needs of our customers and to protect the communities in which we operate. This quarter we signed a power purchase agreement for solar power with SunEdison. This purchase of 105 megawatts ensures the generation of renewable power equaling 100% of the energy for Equinix's California data centers. This agreement will increase our use of green energy sources from 30% to 43% of our data center footprint, and represents significant progress towards our stated long-term goal of using 100% clean or renewable energy.","Now, let me cover the quarterly highlights from our industry verticals. Network operators continue to expand their infrastructure as they implement 100-gig platforms and augment their networks to deliver new services for mobile, content delivery, video streaming and cloud-based services. A resurgence of subsea cable projects is also creating opportunity for Equinix, helping service providers accelerate returns by terminating cables directly into our IBXes. Equinix is working with AquaComms who is deploying one of the first trans-Atlantic subsea cables in more than a decade to meet increased bandwidth needs for global businesses.","Our New York and London data centers will serve as the carrier neutral, low latency network access points to this cable system. In addition, our West Coast data centers will anchor the new trans-Pacific subsea cable system named FASTER. This new cable route will be one of the longest high-capacity routes in the world, and will be backhauled into four of our data centers in Silicon Valley, Seattle and Los Angeles.","In the content and digital media vertical, we continue to see consumer content companies architect their delivery infrastructure via platform Equinix to respond to cost and performance imperatives driven by the demands of today's mobile users. Growth was driven by global expansions from players including Baidu, a Chinese web services company and Cr\u00e9teil, a French company specializing in performance marketing, as well as new wins with three of the largest consumer application providers in music, social networking and accommodations. Advertising and e-commerce sub-segments continue to be our strongest growth performers in this space.","Turning to the financial services vertical, we see continued diversification in our financial services business with additional wins from Australian Securities Exchange operations, a global financial market exchange as well as wins with a leading global insurance syndicate and one of the largest banks in the world. We also had lighthouse wins in digital payments and we see encouraging signs of ecosystem formation in this area.","Turning to cloud and IT services, we are experiencing continued momentum across the cloud ecosystem, which drove strong bookings this quarter as major cloud and IT players, such as AWS, Cisco, Dimension Data, and EMC continue to expand and our relationship with Rackspace extended to include their participation on the Equinix Cloud Exchange.","With over 240 customers provision, we continue to see momentum on our Cloud Exchange, our cloud interconnection solution that allows customers to dynamically create and manage private, secure virtual connections to multiple cloud services over a single port, simplifying cloud migrations and enabling workload mobility from cloud-to-cloud.","We're pleased to announce we are also collaborating with Oracle to enable high performance global direct access to Oracle's full suite of cloud services across six markets. This will allow customers to easily create connections to Oracle's cloud-based business applications while reducing the application latency often associated with traditional cloud access. As one of the largest cloud providers, the addition of Oracle Cloud to the Equinix Cloud Exchange strengthens our ability to deliver unrivalled choice to our customers.","In October, Equinix worked closely with Microsoft to launch a private Azure ExpressRoute connection to Office 365 through the Equinix Cloud Exchange. Office 365 is one of the most requested applications by enterprises and leveraging ExpressRoute via Cloud Exchange dramatically improves the performance and security of Office 365. We're now offering this solution across all 16 metros where ExpressRoute is available on Cloud Exchange and have seen very strong interest.","Turning to the enterprise vertical, the enterprise vertical delivered record bookings, and we are seeing continued traction in penetrating this massive addressable market. Notably as of the third quarter, enterprises became our largest source of new customer adds with traction in transportation, manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. Over 250 customers have now deployed our Performance Hub solution to optimize network architectures and drive application performance by securely and efficiently connecting to network and cloud services.","Turning to slide five, our enterprise go-to-market strategy is based on four use cases for people, clouds, locations, and data that allow us to effectively solve enterprise pain points by making the transition to an interconnection-oriented architecture. Whether it's deploying applications to distributed users or leveraging data intensive analytics, enterprises are facing challenges around security, networking cost and performance that we are helping them solve.","For example, a global media and software customer worked with Equinix to solve inefficient and insecure access to multiple cloud providers. By deploying a distributed hub infrastructure inside of Equinix and connecting privately to multiple clouds, this customer benefited from a 25% reduction in latency and a 50% reduction in OpEx per application.","Our global reach as well as networking cloud density represent powerful and difficult to replicate advantages in servicing the demand for multi- cloud. But translating these advantages into customer acquisition and market share capture, requires a continued evolution of our product and go-to-market capabilities. We have made significant progress in 2015 with our Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange offers and will continue to expand our portfolio of high impact, channel ready offers to help enterprises satisfy their hybrid cloud aspirations.","On the go-to-market front, we continue to drive productivity improvements in our direct selling teams, and are investing in parallel in our channel and partner program to dramatically expand market reach and enable the delivery of more complete solutions to meet key customer requirements. We're pleased with the progress of our channel initiatives and continue to see partner bookings grow as a percentage of our overall sales.","So, let me stop here and turn it over to Keith, to go through the results for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone on the call.","We had another great quarter and the value of our platform as reflected in the health of our key operating metrics continues to rise. We had once again strong gross and net bookings and our MRR churn remains at the lower end of our guidance range. Consistent with the last four quarters, we had positive net pricing actions, and we recorded the highest increase in net cabinets billing in our history, adding 4,700 incremental billing cabinets in Q3, more than double the average quarterly rate in 2014.","Our MRR per cabinet on an FX neutral basis remained firm. We're delighted with the interconnection activity in the quarter, and we added significant new cross-connects and exchange ports. Interconnection revenues as a percent of our recurring revenues continue to pick up across each of our regions. So, based on the strength of our gross and net bookings activity, as well as the continued momentum across our business, we are once again raising our guidance expectations despite the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar for each of revenues, EBITDA and AFFO for Q4 and 2015. And as we finish the year on this strong note, this clearly positions us for a solid start to 2016. Our updated revenue guidance now implies a normalized and constant currency growth rate of over 16% compared to the prior year, the highest annual growth we have seen since 2012.","Now moving to some comments on the acquisitions. We continue to progress with both our Telecity and Bit-isle transactions. The Bit-isle share tender period closed this past Monday and we are happy to note that 97% of the Bit-isle shares were tendered. We expect to acquire the remaining shares of Bit-isle by the end of the year. The Bit-isle transaction will officially close in early November, and we'll report their results in our consolidated financials from that point forward.","Please note, we have not included Bit-isle in our guidance. And accordingly, we'll update you on the financial results on our next earnings call. As stated previously, we expect Bit-isle to create significant value for our shareholders and to be accretive to Equinix's AFFO per share upon close.","Also we're continuing our journey as a REIT, and in August, Equinix was added to the MSCI US REIT Index as the largest data center REIT. We remain pleased with the diversification of our shareholder base as many REIT investors joined our traditional technology investor base. Given the changing investor mix, we'll work to clearly message our story to both these investor groups.","So now moving to the slides. As depicted on slide six, global Q3 revenues were $686.6 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter, and up 17% over the same quarter last year on a normalizing constant currency basis. Our revenues over performance was due to strong bookings activity and net positive pricing actions.","Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges absorbed a $4 million negative currency headwind when compared to either the average FX rates of last quarter or our prior FX guidance rates. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, our updated 2015 guidance now includes incremental FX headwinds of $13 million on the revenue line and $4 million related to adjusted EBITDA when compared to our prior FX guidance rates. Therefore, our current 2015 revenue guidance now absorbs $138 million currency headwind while EBITDA is negatively impacted by $56 million when compared to the average rates used in 2014.","As we look to 2016, we continue to believe the U.S. dollar will remain strong and create some level of headwind when compared to the average rates in 2015 in addition to the averaging down of our current hedge positions. We'll update you on the estimated impact of FX on the next earnings call.","Global adjusted EBITDA was $321.5 million, above the top end of our guidance range, and up 3% over the prior quarter and 20% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, largely due to strong revenue flow through. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%. Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance net of our FX hedges reflects a negative $800,000 currency impact when compared to the average FX rates from last quarter and a $500,000 positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates.","Global AFFO was $210.4 million. Excluding the $11.6 million FX loss related to net investment hedge for the Telecity acquisition and $4 million of incremental financing cost related to both the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, AFFO on a normalized and constant currency basis increased 2% over the prior quarter.","As a reminder, we've hedged the majority of our pound sterling net investment exposure related to the Telecity acquisition. When we mark-to-market these hedges whether realized or unrealized, the fluctuations will flow through net income on the other income and expense line and therefore affect AFFO and other reported metrics until we close the deal. As we look forward, we'll continue to keep you updated on the impact of this hedge position and how it affects our AFFO metric.","Global net income was $41.1 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.71, including acquisition cost of $13.4 million and the $11.6 million FX loss in the Telecity acquisition related hedge.","And finally moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q3 was 2%, our fifth quarter in a row at this lower level. For Q4, we expect the quarterly MRR churn to be at the high-end of our range between 2% and 2.5%, which includes some of the MRR churn originally expected to incur in Q3.","Now turning to slide seven, I'd like to start reviewing the regional results, beginning with the Americas. The Americas region had a strong bookings quarter, lower than planned MRR churn and favorable pricing. On a normalizing constant currency basis, the Americas revenues were up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 13% year-over-year. Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 2% over the prior quarter and up 12% year-over-year on a normalizing constant currency basis.","Americas interconnection revenues represents 22% of the regions recurring revenues and we added 3,500 net cross-connects and 78 exchange ports in the quarter. Americas net cabinets billing increased by 1,500 in the quarter. Also we're proceeding with a new build in S\u00e3o Paulo, the financial capital and the main data center market in Brazil. This will be out third IBX in the S\u00e3o Paulo market and a fifth IBX in the Brazilian market. Equinix purchased a land for S\u00e3o Paulo III, consistent with our desire to own more of our IBXs as we expand the business.","We also broke ground on our Ashburn North campus, undeveloped land that we will also \u2013 pardon me \u2013 that we also own next to our current Ashburn campus, which is the largest Internet Exchange points in North America. Equinix currently has 10 IBXs in Ashburn and the surrounding area. This new campus, which we plan to develop over the next few years will effectively double the capacity we have in this market.","Now looking at EMEA, please turn to slide eight. EMEA delivered another strong quarter with record bookings with particular strength in the French and Dutch markets. On a normalizing constant currency basis, revenues were up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 22% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA was up 4% over the prior quarter and 26% over the same quarter last year.","We had another solid quarter of increased interconnection activity, adding 1,800 net cross-connects. EMEA interconnection revenues represent 9% of the regions recurring revenues. EMEA MRR per cabinet was flat on a constant currency basis and net cabinets billing increased by 1,800. Given the strong performance in our key markets, we plan to move forward with additional expansion phases in both Amsterdam and London. This includes the next phase of London 6, the new build in our Slough campus that only opened earlier this year.","And now looking at Asia-Pacific, refer to slide nine please. Asia-Pacific continued its rapid growth as customers continue to deploy into this region. Revenues were up 6% over the prior quarter and 26% over the same quarter last year on a normalizing constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 6% over the prior quarter and 37% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 52% with strong flow-through from the revenue line.","MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis was down slightly quarter-over-quarter, which included a large number of billable cabinets being installed. Net cabinets billing increased by 1,400 over the prior quarter and we added a healthy 1,700 net cross-connects. Interconnection revenues stepped up to 13% of the regions recurring revenues. For builds, we opened a new phase in Hong Kong and Singapore this quarter and currently have five expansion projects underway across four countries.","And now, looking at the balance sheet, please refer to slide 10. Unrestricted cash and investment decreased this quarter to $340 million, largely due to our continued investment in CapEx and the payment of our third quarter cash dividend. Our net debt leverage ratio currently is 3.4 times of Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. As we look forward, we continue to actively review our capital structure and financing needs, largely due to the planned acquisition of Telecity and soon to close Bit-isle transaction. But, as well as we continue to just stay at the level of investment as we spend our platform to support the trajectory of our business.","Now, switching to AFFO and dividends on slide 11. For 2015, we're raising our expected AFFO guidance to now range between $866 million and $870 million, an effective dollar increase of $29 million over our prior guidance or a 24% year-over-year increase on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our AFFO guidance, as mentioned previously includes the impact of the Telecity net investment hedge in Q3, but no, our updated AFFO guidance does not make any assumption for Q4 relating to the net investment hedge for Telecity.","Also today, we announced our Q4 dividend of $1.64 a share \u2013 sorry, pardon me \u2013 $1.69 a share, consistent with our prior quarterly dividends. Our AFFO payout ratio remains at 45%. Our previously announced 2015 special distribution of $627 million will also be paid in the fourth quarter in a combination of up to 20% in cash and at least 80% in stock. Do note, by the virtue of the special distribution being paid before the Q4 quarterly cash dividend record date, we're effectively increasing our quarterly dividend by 3% as the 1.7 million incremental shares from the distribution will have already been issued to our shareholders.","Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 12. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $216 million, including recurring CapEx of $26 million. Given our rapid fill rates and over performance year-to-date, we're closely assessing our inventory and expect to continue to invest to support our platform. We're narrowing our 2015 CapEx guidance to the top end of our prior range of $830 million to $850 million.","Turning to slide 13. The operating performance of our stabilized 67 global IBX and expansion projects that have been opened for more than one year delivers steady as reported growth of 6%, an increase over the prior quarter and more closely aligned with our expectations. Utilization of these assets increased to 86%, up 2% over the prior quarter as we filled additional capacity in these stabilized assets with particular high absorption in London, Munich and Silicon Valley markets. At the end of Q3, our stabilized projects generated a 33% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested, reflecting the economic value these stabilized campuses deliver.","So with that, let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Keith. Let me now cover our 2015 outlook on slides 14 to slide 17. Note that, the following guidance does not include the Bit-isle transaction that is expected to close in Q4. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to range between $701 million and $705 million, and normalized and constant currency growth rate of 3% quarter-over-quarter, which includes $4 million negative foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 of 2015.","Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $153 million to $157 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $328 million and $332 million, which includes a $4 million negative foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 of 2015. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $242 million and $262 million, which includes approximately $34 million of recurring capital expenditures.","For the full year of 2015, we are raising revenues to range between $2.696 billion and $2.7 billion, a 16% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis, which includes $13 million of negative foreign currency impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. The revised revenues are a $21 million increase compared to our prior guidance. Total year cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%.","Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $601 million to $605 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to range between $1.267 billion and $1.271 billion or a 47% adjusted EBITDA margin. This guidance includes $4 million of negative foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 19%. Excluding this currency impact the revised adjusted EBITDA is an $18 million increase compared to prior guidance. We expect adjusted funds from operations to range between $866 million and $870 million or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 24%.","As noted by Keith, this guidance does not include the impact from the Telecity transaction hedging for Q4, although, this will continue to impact our as-reported AFFO results. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $830 million and $850 million, which includes $110 million of recurring capital expenditures.","In closing, we are expanding our market leadership and driving disciplined execution of our differentiated strategy. We believe that the strength of our digital ecosystems and the global breadth of our interconnection platform create a powerful fly wheel to fuel our business and drive IT transformation. Our role as an enabler of the hybrid and multi-cloud represents a powerful near-term catalyst for enterprise penetration and we will continue to invest in this significant opportunity. We are working to accelerate our alignment and agility as an organization and look forward to updating the market as we progress with these initiatives.","So let me stop here and we'll open it up for questions. So back over to you, Bob.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question speaker is from Mr. David Barden from Bank of America. Your line is open sir.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Appreciate it. Good quarter. I guess, first question, I guess, Steve, would be, with respect to some of the comments on the Telecity deal and the November 13 decision that we're expecting from the EU. Obviously, there was a big filing about commitments that you guys have made with respect to closing the transaction and you spoke about some market testing of these commitments. Could you elaborate a little bit on what they are and if they affect the economics of the transaction in any material way? And then I guess, second, Keith, just on the hedge for the European market, obviously, it was a decision that you took at the beginning of this year. It's paid off to be relatively aggressive hedging the EU currency blocks. Are you planning to continue in 2016 a fairly aggressive static hedge or are you going to be a little bit more dynamic in how you think about currencies and where you think the incremental moves are going to go and how aggressive are you planning on being with respect to the hedges in the European market? Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, David. Thanks. Let me start with the first one, and Keith, we'll hand to you for the second piece. So, David, we're somewhat limited in what we can provide color on around the Telecity situation, but let me tell you what we can share with everybody. So number one, we are moving forward with the EU Commission and targeting a regulatory clearance in Phase 1. We've had, as you would expect, ongoing dialogue with the Commission over the past several weeks and have had very good interaction. Based on those discussions, we have proceeded with a formal offer of proposed commitments as noted in our recent 8-K. So for a variety of reasons, we cannot comment much further on the nature of those commitments, but we remain optimistic about a Phase 1 clearance of this transaction and a first half 2016 close, that is in line with our previous guidance. And we do expect a response from the Commission by November 13 and then we'll update you accordingly after that point.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I feel like that's already written on a piece of paper in front of you, Steve.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, we're somewhat limited, David, as you might expect on sharing any color on the activity until we get to the November 13 timeframe, so they have a 10-day working day period to do the market test, and that's the period we're in now.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","David, let me just move forward then just on your questions around the hedge. First and foremost, the piece that's affecting the AFFO, which was not in our prior guidance and again, it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, that relates to us hedging out our net investment exposure for the acquisition of the Telecity asset. And so, as you can appreciate, that will continue to fluctuate until we close. So if you will \u2013 the net \u2013 the loss that we experienced this quarter, the offsetting impact sits inside \u2013 will sit inside purchase accounting when we actually close the transaction.","If I was to actually \u2013 if I was actually to use the same exchange rates \u2013 if I use the spot exchange rate today for effectively the transaction, that $11.6 million, sort of loss would turn into a gain, if it was this quarter. So, it gives you a sense of the volatility because it's almost a $1 billion hedge. As it relates to our ongoing monitory hedges and our balance sheet hedges as well as the embedded derivatives that we do, as a company, we're still going to continue to hedge where we can somewhat aggressively. And why we want to do that, we think there will continue to be strength in the U.S. dollar. But as you'll recall, we hedge out now anywhere from six to eight quarters. We feather them in, and of course effectively it's smoothing out the impact of how the currencies are going to move.","In this case, we've been clearly a net beneficiary of our hedging through fiscal year. Despite where currencies have gone, we've been a net beneficiary of hedging. And so, we want to continue to use that where appropriate. There's some markets that we will not hedge. As we've said, it's just too darn expensive; Brazil is that one example. And again, the majority of our hedges, anytime you think of our European hedge, it's already going through our results. When you think about \u2013 it's going through our result, pardon me, it's going through \u2013 and we get proper hedge accounting. When we go to Asia, all of that stuff we report basically, we report as for the gains and losses in the P&L below the line.","So, we'll try and be really transparent over the next little while on our hedging positions. We're certainly going to be very clear as we move to close our planned transactions, not only because of the influence that new currencies will have or the increase in currencies will have exposed to as it relates to yen, sterling and euro. But most of that will take place as or when we close the transactions for Telecity and Bit-isle.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Awesome. Thanks, thanks, guys.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Rollins from Citi. Your line is open.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Was wondering if you kind of look back over the course of the year, if I remember correctly, your original constant currency revenue guidance was around 12% for 2015. And you mentioned in this deck that it's around 16% today. I'm wondering if you can give us a bridge to what the sources of outperformance were, regionally \u2013 maybe by vertical? And at the same time, are you seeing some segments underperform where you thought they would be? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Let me take one piece of it, Michael, and then I'm going to defer \u2013 I'm going to look at Charles and Steve for some other color. So, I want to make sure that we're clear with everybody on what we did. When we started out the year, as you will recall, we said that we could do greater than and clearly \u2013 so, when you look at our internal plan relative to what we performed, we felt we could do a bit better than the guidance that we delivered because those are greater than \u2013 that all said, as we progressed through the year, there's a number of things that worked very much in our benefit.","Number one, we are booking a little bit more in the gross line than we originally anticipated, so that's net positive. Second piece is, churn is not as great as we anticipated, and you've seen that in each of our actuals relative to our quarterly guide, so we get the benefit of churn. Three, our net pricing actions are positive. And again, as I said, we've had steady quarterly flow of net pricing actions, and that's \u2013 that does wonders \u2013 wonders for the revenue line. Four, we've done more, more than we originally anticipated, on the non-recurring line in this quarter, sorry \u2013 pardon me \u2013 Q3, as we guide forward for Q4, we're going to do roughly $40 million on the non-recurring line, so it gives you a sense that that was \u2013 that was a lot higher than we originally anticipated to that \u2013 it's probably to the tune of $30 million odd.","And then the fifth thing I'll tell you is, the sales leadership has done a real good job of better managing the booking and billing activity through the quarter. So, as we measure ourselves, and we call them banana charts, those banana charts look more like a straight line from where we're getting, a more \u2013 a more steady flow of revenue throughout the quarter instead of it all being back-ended.","And between those \u2013 those five things I've all added, so bottom-line, I'd just tell you, there is not any one thing from, from a financial perspective \u2013 what I'll defer to Steve and Charles, you want to talk about the verticals and the like.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, let me get \u2013 and Charles you may have something else to add, but let me give you a vertical orientation to that, Mike. Whether it's bookings or revenue, let me give you a recurring revenue, kind of picture Q3 of 2015. Our cloud revenue, recurring revenue, is approaching 28% of total revenue in the company. So, you can obviously see there's growth in the cloud and IT services segment. The other big mover has been enterprise. We've gone from high-single-digit of our recurring revenue now to approaching 12% of our revenue in the enterprise vertical. We're still getting good growth in the other core verticals, but the big movers has really been around the core story that we've had last several quarters is the cloud and enterprise activity that we see around our cloud exchange and around the uptick on in those two verticals.","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Maybe a little more color again. One, I think regionally, we've had strength across all three markets obviously with Europe and Asia in particular growing faster, but really very strong growth in the Americas given the overall size of the business. As Steve said, there are strong bookings across the board also as I think I mentioned in the last call, cloud and enterprise in particular are over-indexing meaningfully in bookings, meaning that comparing our percentage of bookings coming from those segments to the percentage of the installed base, those are really growing faster. But that's not \u2013 that over-indexing isn't caused by weakness in the others, it's really caused by strength in that particular ecosystem taking shape.","And then the other thing I guess I'd point to as you can see, interconnection, we just said is a 21% grower on a constant currency basis compared to 15% or 16% overall. And so again, interconnection is also over-indexing significantly, which obviously has a materially positive impact to the business. And if you look at it and you unpack that a bit further and peel the onion back, it's really strong across our ecosystems. So, what I would say is in network, for example, we're actually seeing good strength on a net cross-connect basis, driven in part by really some of the grooming activity that occurred over the last couple of years subsiding and now actually networking \u2013 network providers and carriers really looking to add to their service portfolio in a variety of ways, which is increasing their appetite for interconnection.","And now, also cloud is our fastest growing sort of end destination for interconnection, which I think is further evidence that that ecosystem is really starting to take shape. And that the secular trends are just extraordinary. If you look at the momentum in our Internet Exchange in terms of the port volumes and the \u2013 and how those translate into traffic growth, it just continues to say that mobile Big Data, Big Data and analytics, social media, et cetera and how people are really architecting to deliver greater levels of application performance in a hybrid multi-cloud world, really all adding across all the verticals.","So I don't think there is any particular segment that has underperformed. I think there are some that are evolving, how people use us in the content and digital media sector has changed. One of the things, and it's been several years now, where some of those larger players moved to these multi-tiered architectures, which has really been a net benefit for us, has opened up capacity that we resold at higher rates and really they are using us more for content delivery, private CDN type implementations, hubbing applications and interaction between the cloud and the content and digital media world particularly in the advertising segment. So, really strong performance across the board.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Mr. Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore. Your line is open.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you for taking the questions. I was wondering, Steve, if you could spend a little bit more time talking about what's happening with these enterprises that are coming in to plug into the hybrid and multi-cloud environments. On average, maybe how many different clouds are plugging into, how involved is Nimbo or your other sort of tech professionals in helping these people onboard? And then, I'm wondering if there's any relationship between what we're seeing in terms of the enterprises taking advantage of that ecosystem and some of the net pricing actions on the positive side that you guys have been talking to? And in fact, if there's any additional color in terms of breaking down those net positive pricing actions, that'd be great too. Thank you.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Why don't I start out here and then you guys can add around the edges? So with the enterprises, the primary draw with us right now, Jonathan, as most people on this phone know are with the large IaaS cloud providers, it's AWS, Microsoft, with Azure and the work we're doing with Office 365, Google, IBM, SoftLayer. And then there's a variety of other providers, SaaS and other infrastructure providers. But as you all know, the primary uptick today, as many of those enterprises are connecting to the larger IaaS providers, because that's where \u2013 we're making that really easy for them to do and it's highly secure and it's helping performance of applications, it's helping latency and all the things we've been talking about for years.","So, it is the draw. The sales teams are setting a hook, as you've heard us talk about, with our network \u2013 with our Performance Hub offering. We very quickly transitioned into how we can connect them to the cloud exchange to see the cloud providers on the other side and then most of use cases and success stories that we're building are around everything we've described in our prepared remarks. I mean, we have a lots of use cases now, where we're approaching a 110 Fortune 500 companies now, that are in the house. So we're seeing great traction now with enterprises and the stories resonate, and so the two primary offerings that we've built the story around the last several quarters, the Performance Hub, which helps network optimization and application performance, I think obviously connecting to the cloud exchange to see the clouds is the primary driver.","Nimbo is still early days, Charles can provide a little color on that. But it is starting to work where companies need to have a plan to find the multi-cloud or figure out how to take advantage of the hybrid cloud, they are coming to us, we're connecting those dots internally, we are helping them build those architecture plans and helping them build their transition plan, so that's to starting to happen. Pull through will start to happen for colo as it matures. And generally the ecosystem as Charles just described is a major draw here. And as we're getting deeper into the enterprises, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're seeing a big uptake in the interconnected requirements for enterprises across multiple industry verticals. Charles?","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I would add I guess a few things. One, I'd point you to slide five in the deck around those four use cases that we're really starting to see take hold and importantly the bottom of that page which talks about the sort of quantifiable proof points of how enterprise customers in particular are creating value by using platform Equinix to implement a hybrid cloud and multi-cloud kind of strategy. It is definitely a longer and more complex sales cycle. We are clearly prosecuting the market from the top-down, meaning sort of targeting the top of the enterprise pyramid and as I said, probably more sophisticated enterprise buyers.","Nimbo is having an impact. The interesting thing is I would say that there is virtually nobody at the top of that enterprise pyramid that we're engaged with, that is not already using or considering to use of either AWS or Azure or Google Cloud as a fundamental part of their hybrid cloud architecture. I mean, our Nimbo team is very well-positioned to help them through how to migrate applications into a hybrid cloud environment. Our solution architects, which we have now \u2013 we expanded significantly over the last couple of years. This quarter was actually the largest \u2013 we track the percentage of deals that they impact in our bookings and this is the largest quarter ever in terms of percentage of deals impacted and directly touched by that group. So definitely having an impact, still early innings I think in the overall evolution, but at least my experience in terms of how enterprise technology markets proceed, I think we're very much seeing this sort of early stage of lighthouse wins, which then begins to translate to the mid-market taking hold, particularly through channel, which also is proceeding well. So continue to be excited about that, but page five is I think a great place to look in terms of what's really attracting these customers.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. And did you guys talk about the positive pricing actions and where that's coming from?","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think on balance what you're seeing is that we are pretty rigorous about implementing annual price increases into our contracts and because we have I think increased the level of discipline around installations we're taking into the facilities and as we say, right applications \u2013 right customer, right applications, right assets, what we're seeing is the churn is mitigating and also the sort of price pressure upon renewal when you're talking about high-value implementations is substantially sort of mitigated. And so, as a result what we were seeing, which is potentially a \u2013 that flipped on its head, is really now seeing that the price actions and the price increases really giving us a net benefit versus any kind of pressure on renewals, so. And I think that reflects also in the churn line.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC","All right. Thanks for taking the questions.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. So, for Keith, I've got a question regarding slide 13 and the stabilized IBX comparison. I think that's a global slide and I wonder if you can just update us on a regional basis, how the cash-on-cash returns would compare for stabilized IBXs in EMEA versus Asia-Pac versus Americas? And then, kind of the same question for kind of the organic revenue growth that you're seeing across the regions in stabilized assets.","And then, the second question is just around the indirect channel and you talked about an increasing portion of the bookings coming from agents and resellers and so forth and I wondered, are you still at the point where you're establishing that network of partners and broadening it or are you focusing more on depth within your existing set of indirect partners? Thank you.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Jonathan. Let me take the second one first and then, I'll kick it back to Keith to hit the first one on slide 13. We are definitely expanding the overall scope of the partner program, but I will say is that what we are doing is starting to focus our efforts more on what we believe the really high impact partners are. There's a set of a particularly sort of capable resellers that bring a very complete solution in the cloud space to customers who are looking to use us, again, as a hybrid cloud, sort of multi-cloud hub and we're having real success in terms of working with those partners to penetrate large enterprise customers. But we are selectively looking to expand that reseller base. Probably not a lot of focus on \u2013 I think we've got a pretty good set of referral and agent type partners that we're working with and those continue to be a solid source of lead generation for us. But our focus really is on the real value-added resellers and on our partnerships, our evolving partnerships with the technology platform players.","So, we've got some nice success in the market with both AWS and Microsoft in terms of sell with type of motion with them. And that's something I think we'll continue to put a lot of energy and in fact we're increasing our field force now to really accelerate the investment in that. And we think there's a lot of upside in that, so continuing to grow, but probably more focused on generating more volume from our productive partners at this stage rather than a focus on more partners.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","So, Jonathan, just on your first question as related to where we're seeing the growth across the regions. The 67 stabilized assets, it's broken down and again it's on page \u2013 if you look at page 27, 28 and 29 of the deck that we shared with you. We break down where the assets are. I don't actually have the specifics on a region basis on the revenue growth, but let me just give you some broad color. As I said, when you look at the Americas, it's growing roughly 10%, you've got Europe growing roughly 22% year-over-year and then you've got Asia growing 26% year-over-year. You can see where the stabilized assets are and where we're investing. I think it's something that we'll have to \u2013 as we think about the question, we'll have to probably respond offline to that specific request. But as Charles alluded to, let me just give you some color in the sense that as we commented on, we're filling up our capacity in a very meaningful way.","As we said 4,700 cabinets sold this quarter, our utilization levels are moving up. We can see it across our inventory base. We're looking at our expansion activities. So suffice it to say, we're seeing good growth across the organization, across all three regions and so I'm very excited about where we are. But to give you a specific right now, I don't actually have that at hand and so we'll take that as a to do.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's a probably a little dangerous speculation, but what I would say is the likelihood is because of the strength of the interconnection business in the Americas and the higher average price point of interconnection on a unit basis, I would guess that you're going to see slightly higher stabilized yield \u2013 growth rates in those assets, but again, we'd have to break that down. But we are seeing good momentum also in interconnection in the other two regions. And again, you see continued power uptake in all of those facilities as well, so it's going to be a blend of those things, but I think I would say there is strength across the board.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then just real quick on Bit-isle, what would be a typical integration timeframe for that size of acquisition from both an IT and organizational perspective? Are we talking months or quarters before we see full integration?","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it'll take a little bit long. This is Steve, Jonathan. It'll take a little bit longer than a typical integration plan in Japan, just due to the culture and the language barriers, et cetera. There's a fairly sizable team that we're picking up, and there's pretty significant language challenges, but we'll convert the financials, the IT pretty quickly, but we're going to take our time with branding decisions and marketing decisions and go-to-market decisions, and the plan is being built now, but it is going to be a little bit longer than a typical integration just because of those complexities.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Mr. Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys, thanks. Maybe just a quick comment on the combined DLR\/Telx, as far as competition goes, any change there? And then I guess secondly on the Asia-Pac margin expansion has been really steady and increasing, your just thoughts on drivers there? And then how high can those margins go in APAC?","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, why don't I start with the DLR\/Telx, just a couple of thoughts and then Charles, you probably have a thought or two you could add, but I think our general belief across the company is that the combination will not change the competitive landscape meaningfully, and I think they understand and I think the market understands that the degree of difficulty to \u2013 attempt to \u2013 I think the question is getting at, can they replicate what's been going on here for 17 years? And I believe the degree of difficulty to replicate a global at-scale platform that has the consistency of service delivery and full portfolio of services that we built in 17 years is a pretty high bar to attack and huge investment in some fairly unfamiliar areas to get a global retail business up and running.","So, I think it's going to help in their Americas business for sure, but there's a lot between the wholesale and retail when you talk about what happens between the executive suite and the assets on the frontlines that really matters, and I think there's a lot of work to be done there and that's where Equinix spends a lot of time. Services, all the stuff you're hearing about today is really our sweet spot and the core difference I think between a retail and a wholesale model.","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I mean, just same themes I think, but in the end, competition isn't about what we're saying on investor calls or analyst days or anything else, it's about what happens at the customer and it's about \u2013 and competition is created. If there is a company that can provide a reasonably comparable solution to a customer requirement and in that regard I've maintained and continue to maintain that the competitive overlap between our businesses and that of DLR even in a post Telx world remains very small. So, digital is a good choice and a very credible provider for companies who have very large footprint requirements that are part of a multi-tiered architecture and we've seen that dynamic play out for several years now.","And if customer needs good reliable space and power in large chunks at competitive prices then digital is going to be an effective provider, given their cost of capital and their reach. But if they're looking to architecture, IT infrastructure to improve application performance, reduce network costs, enable hybrid multi-cloud, then they typically need a highly distributed environment, and that requires global reach, broad and deep network and cloud density, and a level of retail scale and delivery capability that we've invested hundreds of millions of dollars in over the years and have 4,000-plus employees delivering globally. So, we feel very good about our ability to be effective with the customer in terms of meeting their needs and that's the critical piece. So, bottom line is, we don't see a ton of competitive overlap between the businesses.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","So as it relates to your question just on the margin for Asia-Pacific. Clearly, we saw a great result this quarter of 52%, part of the metaphor we're seeing albeit, it might be something that will not continue on an extended period of days or time period is that with the weakening of the Singapore dollar, there's a number of contracts that we have in Singapore that are U.S. dollar denominated and so with your cost in one currency and your revenue in another, that bodes very well when it's going the right direction. We do hedge against that, but the bottom line we're getting some tailwind from that.","In addition, there was some one-off utility benefits roughly of $1 million in Singapore and Hong Kong that we were able to achieve this quarter. But I think more fundamentally to your question, Mike is that look the Asia-Pacific region is running \u2013 roughly 13% of its revenues are in the form of interconnection. The Americas is roughly 22%. It would not surprise me to see the Asian market continue to move its margins up into the right as it continues to fill its assets. But I don't think you'll get to the same level of the Americas, which is roughly 62% today excluding the corporate overhead cost.","And so, we see it moving up towards, I would think the mid-50%s over an extended period of time, just like I would see Europe moving up a little bit to roughly the 50% mark, and then of course the Americas is at the highest level. So as an organization, I think increasing our \u2013 sorry, filling up our capacity, looking to bend our cost curve, and run the organization more efficiently, I think it bodes well for our overall targets of continuing to scale and drive margin into the business.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from Mr. Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot for fitting me in. I think Keith you said that churn would be at the higher end of the 2% to 2.5% range. Can you just provide a little bit more color around that and is that sort of coming through the quarter or is it coming at the end of the quarter as we think about the guidance that you've given and then perhaps just thinking forward into 2016, should we still think about that 2% to 2.5% range, it's sort of been up and down quite a bit, been good for a few quarters, this is going to be the highest in a little while, some color on that would be great?","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Simon,, I'd have to say clearly, as we've said in the past, sometimes churn is lumpy and as much as we anticipated churn activity this quarter, we said on an earlier call, there are some deals that are still coming. They're larger than the average, let's put it that way. And so there's one deal where we said in European markets, where a customer was going to relocate to their own data center.","We knew we'd have them in one of our facilities for a couple to three years. That time period has ended, and so we're anticipating that move, albeit, it has been delayed. And so I'd tell you it's going to happen at the backend of the quarter. And so, we'll recognize the churn this period. As we look forward, I'd tell you there's no reason for us to come off. At this point our churn metrics for \u2013 I'm sorry, our guidance for 2016, I think is very reasonable to assume anywhere between 2% and 2.5%. But we'll fully update you on that on the Q4 call once we have the clarity, but there's nothing that's sitting out there that's of a concern. And so I think an average of somewhere between 2% and 2.5% per quarter is very reasonable to assume in your models.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right.

We had our best-ever third quarter bookings, reflecting strong execution of our strategy and demonstrating our ability to deliver clear and quantifiable value to our customers as they pursue their digital transformation agenda. Our retail business continues to thrive, generating over 4,400 deals in the quarter across 3,100 customers, with the majority of our bookings comprised of small to midsized multi-metro deals, fueling one of the strongest interconnection quarters in our history. We're executing effectively on our commitment to unlock the power of Platform Equinix for our customers, expanding our geographic reach, enhancing our market-leading interconnection portfolio and responding to evolving customer needs with the launch of new and innovative edge services offerings. ","By focusing on driving enhanced operating leverage in the business, we're enabling investment across our traditional retail business, while layering in incremental capabilities, which together will drive higher attach rates, reduced churn and sustain and enhance cabinet yields over the coming years, allowing us to continue to deliver industry-leading returns.","We are aggressively activating our channel, combining the value of Platform Equinix with partner solutions to accelerate our customer's journey to hybrid and multicloud as the clear architecture of choice. We outgrew the market globally with notable momentum in EMEA, and Equinix now holds the #1 position in 18 of the 25 countries in which we operate. And we continue to extend our global reach, announcing our plans to enter Mexico, the second largest economy in Latin America, with two new markets serving Mexico City and Monterey. In tandem with our strong operating performance, we're advancing a bold sustainability agenda with meaningful progress across environmental, social and governance aspects. We've made significant progress on our goal to use 100% clean and renewable energy for our data centers, with over 90% of our energy consumption today now covered by renewable sources. ","We were recognized by the U.S. EPA for our leading Green Power use, ranking #4 on the EPA's National Top 100 Partners List, and receiving the Green Power Leadership Award for the third consecutive year, recognizing our contribution in advancing the development of the nation's voluntary Green Power market. ","During the quarter, we also announced the addition of Sandra Rivera to our Board of Directors and the hiring of Justin Dustzadeh as our new CTO. We are thrilled to add their deep and diverse experience as world-class technology leaders as we continue to refine and expand our vision for the future of Platform Equinix. Turning to the quarter, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q3 were $1.397 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 9% year-over-year, and AFFO was ahead of our expectations, including -- excluding FX and FX-related impacts. ","Interconnection growth again outpaced colocation revenues, growing 13% year-over-year, driven by solid traction across all interconnection products and particularly strong momentum across our Cloud Exchange fabric. These growth rates are all in a normalized and constant currency basis. ","In October, we closed our first hyperscale JV, a greater-than-$1 billion deal with GIC, the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund. This is a strategic milestone for Equinix, enhancing our ability to respond to the rapidly expanding needs of the world's largest cloud and hyperscale companies, while strengthening our leadership in the cloud ecosystem. We look forward to launching similar JVs in other operating regions and believe these efforts will continue to further differentiate Equinix as the trusted center of a cloud-first world. We now have over 356,000 interconnections, adding more per quarter than our top 10 competitors combined. In Q3, we added an incremental 8,500 interconnections, with high gross adds from both enterprise and network segments accompanied by lower-than-expected churn. We also surpassed 20,000 virtual connections, more than 5% of our overall count, and we expect these connections, which are dynamic and operationally efficient, to accelerate as customers leverage the capabilities on our SDN-enabled ECX Fabric. ","With over 1,800 customers now on ECX Fabric, we're seeing the strong ecosystem effects driven by expanding use cases, including WAN rearchitecture, distributed data, and rapid adoption of hybrid cloud across an increasingly rich range of cloud destinations. ","We also saw a growth of our Internet exchange in the existing and new markets, with 27% year-over-year increase in IX provision capacity. Our newly launched Network Edge product is generating strong market interest with a robust pipeline. This offer provides enterprises a faster and more efficient way to deploy virtual network services at Equinix, including routers, firewalls and load balancers from their technology providers of choice, including Cisco, Juniper and Palo Alto Networks. Now let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical experienced record bookings, led by the major telcos subsegment and significant global MSP reseller activity as we partner with global providers to evolve their architectures and serve rapidly expanding enterprise demand. ","New wins and expansions included Silica networks, a leading fiberoptic provider, optimizing network to support growing customer demand; and Telia, a Nordic provider extending coverage with regional edge deployments. ","Our financial services vertical achieved robust bookings and strong new logo growth, with an uptick in the banking subsegment as firms continue to embrace digital transformation. Key new wins included Sterling Bancorp, rearchitecting the network to securely connect to partners, and a U.S. exchange startup, leveraging the depth and reach of our expansive electronic trading ecosystem. ","Our content and digital media vertical produced solid bookings, led by strong growth in publishing, advertising and video subsegments. New wins and expansions included a global social media firm upgrading infrastructure to support their growing product line as well as a leading global ad tech firm, transforming network topology to distribute and analyze data.","Our cloud and IT vertical continues to over index with strength in the security subvertical as well as a strong increase in ECX Fabric participants as cloud consumers diversify towards hybrid and multicloud architectures. We continue to lead in cloud connectivity with over 3x as many metros with multicloud arm ramps as our nearest competitor. ","Our enterprise vertical experienced diversified growth across professional services, retail as well as notable strength in government. New wins included PruittHealth, deploying on Platform Equinix to support its growing health care ecosystem; Steve Madden, rearchitecting network and connecting to multicloud to better enable digital business; the Myers-Briggs Company, optimizing network and interconnecting the business partners to support data management requirements; as well as further expansions from Walmart, deploying distributed infrastructure to support AI use cases. ","And our channel team had another great quarter, accounting for more than 30% of bookings with 60% of this activity going into our enterprise vertical as we use the reach and relationship of our partners to efficiently expand our addressable market. We saw partner wins across all end-user types, including insurance, federal government, banking, public utilities and pharma, with network optimization and hybrid multicloud as a key use cases. ","New channel wins this quarter included a multi-partner win with Presidio, F5, Microsoft and Oracle, for a large U.S. energy company supporting their data center consolidation and implementations of hybrid and multicloud access.","Now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.","Keith Taylor","Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. Let me start my prepared remarks by saying we remain very pleased with the performance of our business and how Platform Equinix is differentiating us from others in our space. We continue to successfully scale the core business while simultaneously investing in our future, both as it relates to our operating structure and our new products and services. And we continue to invest in sustainability and diversity inclusion and belonging initiatives, 2 areas that are very dear to our communities, our customers and our employees. ","We had another solid quarter with our operating results consistent with our expectations, although impacted by FX and FX-related items. ","From a booking's perspective, we had our best-ever Q3 gross bookings performance, including very attractive deal mix and strong pricing. Interconnection activity was very strong, both at the physical and the virtual level. We're making good progress across our new edge services. Again, we had net positive pricing actions this quarter. As a result, our MRR per cabinet metric remained firm both on an as-reported and FX-neutral basis. In early October, we closed our first hyperscale joint venture in EMEA, and transferred two of our operating assets into the JV, London 10 and Paris 8. As a result, the joint venture distributed a net $355 million of cash to Equinix, and we expect an additional \u20ac60 million over the next four quarters as certain contingent milestones are met. And we continue to expand our global platform with 28 projects underway across 21 metros and 16 different countries, another critical point of separation compared to other companies in our space. ","Now let me cover the quarterly highlights. I note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $1.397 billion, our 67th straight quarter of top line growth, up 8% over the same quarter last year, and at the midpoint in our guidance range on an FX-neutral basis. In the quarter, we experienced an unusually high level of FX volatility, largely derived from the Brexit implications to both the British pound and the euro. Also, the Brazilian real weakened considerably, a currency that is typically too expensive to hedge. And as previously guided, there were a number of one-off advance that impacted the quarter-over-quarter revenue step up, including lower tenant recoveries from a favorable tax decision in Q3 related to our Infomart Dallas asset and then lower-than-expected nonrecurring revenues. ","Q3 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included an $8 million negative FX impact due to the stronger U.S. dollar in the quarter when compared to the prior guidance rates. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $675 million, up 9% over the same quarter last year despite higher seasonal utility cost and the expansion drag. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was better than expected, primarily due to lower maintenance costs. Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, included a negative $4 million FX impact when compared to the prior guidance rates.","Global Q3 AFFO was $473 million, an 18% increase over the same quarter last year, above our expectations on a constant currency basis, while still absorbing the higher-than-anticipated increase in our recurring CapEx. Also, AFFO, on an as-reported basis, absorbs a net $16 million higher-than-planned income tax expense, attributed to FX-related tax gains from our hedging program. Based on the current FX exchange rate through October, we expect a significant portion of this tax expense to reverse in Q4, and accordingly, has been reflected in our AFFO and AFFO per share guidance. Q3 Global MRR churn was 2.3%, consistent with our targeted range. For Q4, we expect MRR churn to remain in our guided range of 2% to 2.5%.","Interconnection revenues increased significantly over the prior quarter with momentum in each of our regions. Interconnection revenues now represent greater than 17% of our recurring revenues, a significant quarter-over-quarter step up. Interconnection -- our interconnection portfolio grew at a healthy pace, driven by strong net adds from both the physical and the virtual connections, while also provisioning significant incremental port capacity. The Americas and EMEA interconnection revenue stepped up to 24% and 10% recurring revenues, respectively, while APAC was 14%.","Turning to the regional highlights, which full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC and EMEA were our fastest MRR growing regions at 13% and 12%, respectively, on a year-over-year normalized basis, followed by the Americas region at 4%. The Americas region saw continued strong bookings with a high mix of small deals, healthy pricing and strong new logo adds. And Export Bookings to the other 2 regions continues to remain at a high as the Americas region does an excellent job of selling across our global platform. And a new federal segment had a stellar quarter, and we remain very excited about the potential opportunities we see across this customer set.","Our EMEA region had another very strong quarter led by our German and French businesses, including strong network service provider activity. EMEA had a robust increase in billable cabinets, firm deal pricing, while experiencing its best ever net cross-connect adds in the quarter, and we opened up capacity in 3 new markets in EMEA: Helsinki, London and Stockholm. ","And Asia Pacific region showed continued momentum over the quarter despite the U.S. trade dispute with China and the unrest that we see in Hong Kong. We enjoyed strong bookings in both our Hong Kong and Singapore businesses. And we opened our first data center in Seoul, South Korea, entering into one of the most vibrant digital economies in the world, our 25th country to operate from. To date, the Seoul business is tracking ahead of its bookings plan.","I'm now looking at the capital structure. Please refer to Slide 8. Our unrestricted cash balance is approximately $1.4 billion, lower than the prior quarter's operating cash flow and proceeds from the ATM program were more than offset by our quarterly capital expenditures and our cash dividend. Our net debt leverage ratio was 3.5x our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA, up slightly due to the lower cash balance, yet still well within our targeted range. ","As a new investment grade-rated company and given the current interest rate environment, we expect to drive substantial interest rate savings through the refinancing of our currently outstanding debt as well as enjoy a lower cost to borrow on any new incremental capital raise to fund our future initiatives. At the end of Q3, our liquidity position, alongside the strong balance sheet, continues to provide us a strategic and unmatched business advantage.","Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $557 million, including a recurring CapEx of $47 million. Q3 had 6 new expansion projects completed, adding 2,800 cabinets of capacity, including new IBXs in Helsinki and Seoul. And we continue to expand our land bank, acquiring land for development in Tokyo and Warsaw.","Our capital investment delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Our 136 stabilized assets increased revenues 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, similar to last quarter. Our stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 30% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. ","And now please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for an updated summary of 2019 guidance and the bridges. For the full year of 2019, on a constant currency basis, we're maintaining our full year revenue guidance while raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $6 million due to strong operating performance. This guidance applies -- implies a revenue growth rate of 9% over the prior year and a healthy adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 48%. Also, we're reducing our 2019 integration cost to now be $9 million. ","And given the strong operating performance, we're also raising our 2019 AFFO by $8 million, while our growth range will range between 13% and 14% compared to the previous year on a normalized and constant currency basis. We do expect slightly lower net interest expense in Q4. AFFO per share is expected to grow 8%, including the dilutive impact of both our Q1 equity raise and the effects of the ATM program activity. We've assumed a weighted average 84.8 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.","And finally, we expect our 2019 cash dividend to now approximate $825 million, a 13% increase over the prior year and reflects an 8% year-over-year increase on a per share basis. ","So with that I'm going to stop, and I'm going to pass it back to Charles.","Charles Meyers","Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had another great quarter, building on our unique source of competitive advantage in demonstrating the underlying strength of our business. We continue to separate ourselves from the competition, using our diverse go-to-market channels and our expansive balance sheet as tools to extend the scope, scale and velocity of our flywheel business, while partnering with world-class players like GIC to enable us to simultaneously capture strategic footprints and deliver attractive returns in the hyperscaler market. ","We also continue to build new capabilities that will allow us to achieve our vision for the future of Platform Equinix, a future that will our customers to reach everywhere, connect with everyone and integrate everything on their digital transformation journey. I am extremely pleased and privileged to work with our team of over 10,000, focused on building on our products and platform, and executing against an ambitious set of priorities in service to our customers, all while steadfastly ensuring that our culture continues to thrive, making sure that we have the right people in the right roles at the right time, building a company that is positively impacting their world and wherever employee can confidently say I'm safe, I belong, and I matter. ","So let me stop there and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Philip Cusick with JPMC.","Philip Cusick","First, maybe you can dig into the tax issue in the Infomart and if that impacted the Americas colo revenue? And then second, what are the incremental costs, Keith, of the green initiatives that we should expect from here?","Keith Taylor","Phil, very astute question that you asked vis-\u00e0-vis the tax implications. We've talked about two sort of currency or tax matters in our prepared remarks this quarter. First and foremost, as it relates to the revenue side of the equation, because we -- when we bought Infomart, there was a, shall we say, a negotiation with the local taxing authorities and the value that gets ascribed to that building and we came to a resolution in Q3. But prior to that, there was a very large assessment that basically was charged, of course, to the tenants of Infomart building. And so we absorbed the cost, and the tenants absorbed, if you will, the pass through of some of those costs. ","In Q3, once we settled the arrangement with the tax authorities, there's a meaningful step down in the amount of taxes that we -- collectively, we're going to pay. And as a result, for those tenants that were part of Infomart, they effectively are going to get a reduction on -- of their taxes, and that affects us directly on our recoveries, if you will, the revenues attached to that. But bottom line is, you've got to step back and say, okay, the revenues' come down, but economically, this was good for, not only our tenant, but it was even better for Equinix because of the -- because we have won a large tenant in the facility and we also absorbed a lot of the unused capacity, if you will, in that space, and that tax gets burdened on to us. So that was the first one.","The second matter I just want to raise, because I think it's important, just to make sure, that was a property tax issue and it's always attached to recoveries. The second issue for us, vis-\u00e0-vis tax, is income tax attached to a very favorable hedge gains that we had on our hedges. And as a result, our income tax provision went up in Q3 because of how weak both the sterling and euro were relative to the U.S. dollar. As you know, a lot of that is reversed already in Q4, but we had to book the provision in Q3, and that's why you see that, that comes out in the bridge.","And then to go back then to your last question, really, which was on the green initiatives. Suffice it to say, Charles has made comments, as did I. We're very, very focused on ESG as a corporation and our green initiatives. And those green initiatives, of course, come in many different shapes and sizes, if you will, from how we procure our power, to offsets, to variable indirect purchase -- power purchase arrangement. But there is a-- I would tell you, it's somewhere right now, we spend somewhere between $10 million and $20 million that we absorb to become 100% sort of, if you will, green-oriented and -- sorry, 100% focused on driving our power consumption through green initiatives. ","And so we're highly focused on that. It is a $10 million to $20 million cost to the business, but we recognize it's important to not only the constituents in the company, but certainly to our communities and very important to our customers, given that we're in their supply chain.","Charles Meyers","But important to note, Phil, that that's -- basically, we've been doing that for a while, and so that's been kind of already baked into our operating results, and it's fully accommodated in our guide.","Philip Cusick","Yes. Okay. I heard on the call -- I thought I heard something that it was incremental cost to be absorbed there, but it sounds like that's mostly done.","Charles Meyers","Yes.","Philip Cusick","Okay. And then on the -- just following up in the Infomart side. Can you give us an idea of the net impact on revenue from that? Or maybe what the sort of underlying trend of the business would have been without that?","Keith Taylor","Yes. So basically it would've taken us to the top end of our guidance range, on an FX-neutral than normalized basis. So basically, it was $4 million.","Operator","Our next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery","So we obviously had a large acquisition and merger in the industry last night. I was just wondering if what your thoughts would be on how that might change the industry dynamics. Do you have any perspective on what the European market might look like after that? And where does Equinix stand today in terms of looking at additional either acquisitions or on the JVs? You've talked about doing those. Or is that anything we'll see in the near term?","Charles Meyers","Sure. Yes. We fully expected that question would surface, Simon. Obviously, a big transaction in our industry for sure. So I'll start with this, we've got tremendous respect for both of those companies. It's not too difficult to, I think, to see why each of those parties might be interested in this combination. Interxion has always been a big risk competitor of ours in Europe, and I'm sure they'll remain as such. As for DLR, as I've said in many a public forum, it's my experience that then overlap between our business and DLR's business is actually fairly small. That will probably not be the case with our xScale joint venture, where we're likely to be more consistently head-to-head, but in our core retail business, we only see them sort of selectively as a competitor.","Just to put it into context, according to Synergy Research, DLR's entire retail business outside of Europe and others what we would be appending from a retail perspective on to the Interxion business, that entire retail business outside of Europe is about a tenth the size of Equinix overall. So in reality, I think the combination represents bringing together 2 very different businesses, a strong European retailer and a strong global wholesaler. So I think there's probably merit in the deal and an industrial logic to it. I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that the combination really meaningfully closes the gap in terms of trying to replicate the scope, scale and value of Platform Equinix.","So -- and I would say I think the challenges in combining those businesses, just mechanically, let alone operationally, financially and culturally, will certainly be nontrivial. And even if and when that's done successfully, I think we'll -- what comes out at the other end is a company we'll feel pretty comfortable competing against, certainly in Europe, which we've been doing obviously for years, and in particular, on a global basis. ","So I think it's understandable, but I think we're going to continue to sell the strength of our value proposition globally and feel like we're going to have great success with our customers.","From a -- answering the second question in terms of our own M&A, we've said that we're going to continue to be -- we continue to believe that's an appropriate tool. At the same time, we're going to be pretty disciplined about that, and we're not going to chase valuations if we think they don't make sense for the business. Obviously, we feel really good about the transaction we recently announced in Mexico to enter that market. I feel like it was really sized right and priced right and gives us a real nice entry strategy into a very important market for us. ","There's few other markets that I think we would entertain as M&A opportunities to enter. And -- but again, we're going to make sure that we do that on a disciplined basis. So we'll -- we feel like it's an appropriate tool in the bag, but one that we're going to use with real discipline.","Simon Flannery","And the hyperscale JV timing for new markets?","Charles Meyers","We haven't really -- we're actively working on that. As we had said previously, we're engaged in Japan actively. The exact timing on those, just given the complexity of the transactions is hard to fully predict. But I think if you look out over the next couple of years, we would expect to add several more JVs to the mix in terms of being able to offer the xScale sort of portfolio in key markets around the world.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Atkin with RBC.","Jonathan Atkin","So Charles, in your prepared remarks, you talked about edge products, and it got me thinking about any sort of trends that you're seeing in your cabinet adds in the Americas and the mix shift between Tier 1 markets and slightly smaller markets. Are you noticing any changes as you sort of develop new capabilities? And could that maybe inform your appetite to enter into, say, minor-league cities rather than just major-league cities?","Charles Meyers","Yes. We're not any seeing any significant shifts in trends. Obviously, our major metros continue to drive the lion's share of both cabinet adds and revenue growth, but we're -- we do see real health in our other markets. I would say that we're going to start by offering our edge services in probably the more logical major metros. But to the extent we see momentum, I do think those will represent an opportunity for us to deploy infrastructure and drive cabinet yields into those markets as well. And then -- and again, depending on, I think, how use cases evolve, whether or not we would need to continue to look at expanding that reach beyond our current footprint, I think is something we're actively looking at. We have a team that we refer to as the evolving edge team, and we're actively looking at how we would do that. ","But I would say right now, the bulk of the use cases that we see are well met by the current footprint that we have. And so being able to deploy our edge services, whether that be Network Edge or some of the others we might contemplate into our very expansive aggregated edge footprint today, we think meets most of the needs of the market and we'll just continue to evolve -- or adapt as use cases might dictate that.","Jonathan Atkin","Okay. And then, on Seoul, just interested, are businesses going to you for the very first -- going with you for the first time into that market? Or are they already in market and then they're kind of using you for their expansion needs?","Charles Meyers","It's more, typically, our existing customers wanting to expand -- extend their infrastructure into Seoul, although we do have a team on the ground that is sort of cultivating local business as well. But we said that our bookings are ahead of plan, thus far. And that's driven by the strength of a couple of key deals where some of our cloud and IT service customers were looking to expand their footprint into that market with a pretty significant deal that we landed in Seoul.","Jonathan Atkin","And then, lastly, just on churn, are there any differences you're seeing in what's driving edge? And any reason to think that you would gravitate towards the low end to the high end of your traditional range going forward?","Charles Meyers","No. It depends more on, I think, it's more timing issues in terms of shifts between quarters, but no substantive shifts. As I said, we've talked about the fact that we are continuing to work through the last bits of the churn tale in the Verizon assets. And I think that we're now feel like we're positioned to get back to growth in 2020 on those assets. And -- but no meaningful shifts. ","What we have seen is, there's not a lot of -- our churn is driven mostly by frictional churn, and to some degree, by things like bankruptcies and those kind of things. We see the occasional shift in terms of moving selective workloads to the cloud, but that's typically churning a portion of an implementation rather than the whole thing because again, what we're seeing is people are very much committed to sort of hybrid and multicloud. And so they're maintaining private infrastructure and then integrating that with cloud assets, public cloud assets. And so no meaningful shifts that we're seeing right now from a churn perspective. ","I will say, over time, though, I would hope that we're going to be able to -- one of the things that you are seeing in our bookings mix is a very clear discipline around these sort of sweet spot deals, well interconnected that's -- so you're seeing that show up in terms of the volume of transactions and number of deals done as well as levels of interconnection. And so those are really encouraging signals for me in terms of execution of the strategy. And over time, I actually think that will help us hopefully trend towards the lower end of our range in terms of churn. ","So that is -- because as I've always said, the best defense against churn is getting the right deployments in to begin with. And so as we look at that, I think some of maybe larger footprints that were more susceptible to longer-term churn are things that we're not going to be doing. We will probably -- we'll be pushing those, particularly a very large footprints off to our -- into our -- into the xScale sort of entity, which is more equipped to deal with those dynamics. And I do hope that will improve our churn position over time.","Operator","Our next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.","Frank Louthan","Can you give us a little color on -- you mentioned the multi-partner win with an energy company. We're the only data center company on that deal and what was in particular anything special about that -- with that? And then I've got a follow up.","Charles Meyers","Yes. It was -- we were, I believe, the preferred -- the only data center involved in that particular transaction. It was a data center consolidation activity, and also sort of integrating into a hybrid cloud architecture. And so they were really utilizing Cloud Exchange fabric as their mechanism to integrate both their network and their cloud connectivity between -- with their private infrastructure. And so really good multi-partner win and one we're really excited about in the quarter.","Frank Louthan","Okay. And looking at America's growth, just curious what you might be able to do to maybe accelerate that going forward? And in particular, can you give us an update on the additional land that was around the Infomart that you could expand? And then what's sort of -- where you are in NAP of the Americas to be able to finish building out that facility? And how that might help improve the growth in Americas?","Charles Meyers","Yes. We -- I think the Americas business continues to perform well, particularly in terms of mix of business. I think we are -- probably the biggest driver is going to be sort of getting us through the last of the churn activity that's been sort of above the -- above prior levels, which is creating a drag in terms of what was essentially a $500 million business, which has not had any growth, and that impacts the overall America's growth rate. And so I think as that subsides, I think we'll start to see some growth there. ","I do think we have opportunities to add in some of our key markets. We've already added capacity, which we're filling at a nice rate in NAP of the Americas. The deal -- or the Dallas campus expansion is underway. Over time, we'll probably add both large footprint capability there as well as increasing retail, so that will probably be an opportunity for us to get some additional growth from that market. ","But I think the bigger things that I'm excited about longer term is us continuing to -- one, continuing to drive additional quota-bearing head count into the market to capture the significant enterprise opportunity we see. Our gross bookings engine is performing very well in the Americas, and not only in terms of landing bookings in the Americas assets, but also delivering those globally across the platform. ","And so I think being able to continue to expand both our channel as well as our direct selling efforts in the region, and then over time, as we add new services, I think we're also going to be able to continue to enhance cabinet yields, but that's going to take some time for those new edge services to really mature.","Operator","Our next question is from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael","Maybe just following up on the growth. Stabilized growth, I think, was 3%, you said, in the quarter. And I thought at least a few quarters ago, there was talk about getting that number back up to 5%. Just curious what you think the longer-term growth rate for stabilized growth should be? And what are the parts that potentially get us a bit higher? Maybe it's just the improvement in the Verizon assets that you mentioned. ","And then secondly, I think in your previous guidance from last quarter, you had assumed that the JV, the GIC JV would close, and I think it was August and they had them closing in October. Curious what the benefit to guidance is in terms of the update you just made for 2019 as a result of that delayed close?","Charles Meyers","Let me take the first one, and I'll ask Keith to address the timing and the GIC transaction. Relative to stabilized asset growth, yes, we've been kind of hovering around that 3% to 4% mark, Colby. And I think the catalysts for getting back into that 5% kind of range would be, one, as you noted and as I noted in the commentary, getting the Verizon assets sort of through the knothole. I do also think the 10 to 100 gig migrations have impacted those to some degree. We did see a good quarter in that. We actually saw a reduction in interconnection churn. I don't think we're all the way through that though. So I think we're -- it's going to sort of continue to go in ways, although the biggest thing -- the biggest players who I think have -- who were going to make that change have largely made it in the Americas. But there probably will be some more of that, that I think will create some downdraft on the stabilized asset growth. ","And we talked about, there also being a few assets that we were actively migrating sort of business out of -- and those kind of impacted as well. So there's a variety of factors. I'm encouraged by what we can do, both with our Network Edge offer as well as with what we see on the horizon in terms of some of the additional edge services because we can deploy infrastructure, shared infrastructure into some of those kind of facilities and get kind of meaningful returns on that and maybe drive some additional growth in cabinet yields into those. But I think that's going to be a longer-term proposition, and we'll probably really stay in that 3%, 4% range for a bit.","Keith Taylor","And Colby, as it relates to the second question, for Q4 -- for Q3, there's really no meaningful movement, as you know, for the Q3 quarter. And when we offered our prior guidance, it was really more about the influence that was going to take place in Q4. And just to remind you and everybody else on how this is going to get accounted for, recognizing that there is fee income that will come with the joint ventures. And as we continue to scale them up, there's fees that get attached to it. The fees come in through the top line through revenue. The equity ownership, the 20% ownership, that effectively comes through below the line, it will be in AFFO, but below EBITDA in the form of income from affiliated entities. And so that's how it sort of will present itself in our financials. ","Suffice it to say, this quarter for Q4 and our guidance and implications on Q3, was -- is negligible. Think about $2 million on either side. And the reason for that is, it's all about timing. It's the timing of the cost, timing of the fees, timing of the income stream associated with how those customers in Seoul and the environment, and those two assets that we have and then as we continue to scale them. ","So overall, what we'll try to do is continue to keep everybody fully abreast of not only this JV, but the ongoing JVs on what, if you will, the fund flow is. But for this year, as we said, there's really never going to be any meaningful impact to our financial results, and for all intents and purposes, it's just been absorbed into the ongoing.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi.","Michael Rollins","Two questions. First, just curious how you're looking at the opportunities to recycle capital for maybe some of the existing assets, whether it's some market that you may not think of as core to the portfolio or situations where it might be just opportunity to take advantage of the private market. And then the second question is just with the ATM program. Is there a framework or allocation strategy that investors should think about in terms of the timing or ways you may access that program in the future?","Keith Taylor","So Charles and I are looking at each other. Which one -- who wants to answer that question? I think, on the first one, let's just touch base on that, first and foremost. Overall, as you hear us continually say and talk about, we really referred to Equinix as a platform. Periodically, there are assets that would be disposed of. Not so much because we're trying to recycle capital, but it's more because when you look at the strategic value of that asset relative to what we're doing with our platform and where we want to invest our dollars, we choose occasionally to turn down a site like we've recently done or sell a small asset when it came with an acquisition. And we did that with Switch & Data. We just recently sold one of Verizon's small assets. We referred to as our New York 12. We sold our Istanbul 1 asset, which came -- was part of Telecity. ","It's not really about recycling. It's more about making sure we create the momentum and the right assets for ourselves. And again, I think it's really important, Michael, for you and for all the listeners on the call today, we sell across this platform. Every asset is highly important to us. And so that's why we're not probably as traditional as some of the others in thinking about recycling because it is the platform. ","As we get then into the discussion around ATM. ATM, I think it ties into a much more broader discussion on how we will fund ourselves in a go forward basis. If we all go back to the June 2018 Analyst Day, we talked about how we could grow the business over the 5-year period in '18 through '22 and what that would mean from capital dollars spent, and if you will, the scale of the dividend and the like. ","As a result, we knew at that point in time that we still -- there was going to be funding in the business, funding needed for the business, and it was going to come in the form of both debt and equity. And so what I would tell you is that there's no -- I wouldn't -- there's no perfect way to describe how we use the ATM, other than what we're trying to do is take advantage of it when it makes sense for the shareholder, and stay away from it when it doesn't make sense for the shareholder. ","And a perfect example would be, in December of last year, when we're at a 52-week low, we were not in the ATM program. When we're reaching some of our all-time highs, we occasionally pulled down a little bit of equity to fund the business because we know that between now and 2022, there is still some capital need to fund all that we have in front of us, including some of the M&A activities. ","And I've said on the last call, you're going to see us do more and more of debt because, one, I think the cost of debt is going down; but two, we've brought some real balance into our capital structure. We'll guard our investment grade rating, and we're at a point where we're well within our targeted leverage range. ","So it's a long-winded way of saying that we're going to moderate. We'll do it wisely. It is a cheaper source of -- so it's a cheaper way to go to the equity markets than doing a follow-on offering. Think about 50 basis points versus something ranging from 1 to 1.5 basis points to do those transactions. And we use it -- we do it at our discretion based on market conditions and targets. ","And so bottom line is, we'll continue to monitor it. Right now, we have roughly $300 million left on the program that we approved last December. We've got a lot of cash in our balance sheet, $1.4 billion, as I said, at the end of Q3. And then you heard me also say with the October closing of the JV, that brought in another $355 million. So we're going to be really prudent about how we refinance our debt, how we raise new debt and how we use our ATM on a go-forward basis to make sure we maximize the return for our investors. Charles, anything else that you want to add or?","Charles Meyers","No.","Keith Taylor","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler","Just moving back to sort of the drivers during the quarter, EMEA was called out as a powerful driver for the quarter. Can you give us a little bit of an update in terms of where we stand vis-\u00e0-vis the accelerated demand you're seeing in the region? Or maybe the catch-up versus the Americas? And then I have a follow-up.","Charles Meyers","Yes. I mean, I think we've seen relatively broad-based sort of demand and strength in the European market. So honestly, our U.K. market continues to be strong despite sort of Brexit uncertainty, et cetera. I think that we have the luxury of a really broad-based business on the continent. And so I think it continues to perform very well. Whereas, I do think we are still seeing the movement of cloud providers into that market more comprehensively. And so that has driven both our direct business with us in terms of their network nodes and their private interconnection nodes, and I think now will fuel the JVs business in a significant way associated with the large footprint. ","And then you're seeing the enterprise movement to hybrid and multicloud really start to catch up, I think, with where the Americas have been as well. So overall, it's been a pretty broad-based strong market for us. And I think the breadth of our business there is showing up nicely. And the teams are doing a great job. We're seeing strong channel activity in that business as well. I would say both Europe and Asia were a little bit sort of a little later in terms of the adoption of the channel, but we're seeing really strong channel uptick there as well. ","So I wouldn't -- in that point, say necessarily anything in particular, but it definitely is a strong market overall.","Jordan Sadler","And the outlook continues to be good, right? It sounds like it still has legs?","Charles Meyers","It does. Yes, we're not -- we're definitely not seeing a softening there. We're -- we have the luxury of when we look at new projects and the fill rates that go with them, we have deep visibility into our pipeline. We have a really clear understanding of what our fill rates have been, and so we're continuing to allocate capital. We probably had a bit of a peak of -- or a bubble of capital that came through over the last couple of years in Europe. But definitely, there's sustained demand there, and so we'll continue to invest in that market as well.","Jordan Sadler","Was there incremental hyperscale leasing volume during the quarter that you could speak to?","Charles Meyers","No. We're still working through in terms -- but I would say that we have a very strong pipeline. And so we're relatively fresh off close in the JV and really getting our pipeline and forecasting and processes really refined between ourselves and our partner. But I would say that we have had really productive discussions with the 12 or so companies that we see as the primary drivers of hyperscale demand. And so I feel like we've got plenty of pipeline to support the JV aspirations.","Jordan Sadler","And then, just lastly, if I may, maybe for Keith. I think you talked about overall best ever bookings, deal mix and pricing. Can you elaborate on the pricing strength that you're seeing? Is that a function of sort of escalators, renewal spreads that you're seeing? Or is this just -- is it -- what is it?","Keith Taylor","Yes -- no, Jordan. I think -- so to just add, I just want to make sure. This was the -- one of our top performing quarters when we look at it across the whole year, but it was our best ever Q3. There's always a little bit of seasonality that comes into play. No surprise in our business.","Jordan Sadler","I did hear that correct. I'm sorry. I misspoke.","Keith Taylor","Yes. And -- but the real drivers behind that are threefold. Number one is, and you heard Charles refer to it, is the deal mix is very, very positive. So the average deal size is a lot smaller, and that allows us to enjoy a better return on a per cabinet basis than we would otherwise see with a larger deal volume. No surprise. Second, you've got to add to that, the interconnection revenues and the opportunities that, that presents itself. But we do a very good job and we have done a very good job of selling this platform. And then you add to that the ancillary services that aren't -- clearly, they're just starting out, if you will. The attach rate that we would see to revenues on a go-forward basis could be very, very attractive. And again, Charles referred to that. ","But the third piece is, and I hope it isn't lost on people. When we think -- but look, we're always having to live within the environment that we operate in, and market conditions at times make it very competitive. But when we renegotiate with our customers and this time there are price adjustments downwards, I think what you should draw great comfort for is that you keep on hearing us talk about positive pricing actions. That means those are the price escalators that are pushing pricing upwards. And so we tend to be in a very net positive position. ","And so as a result, you've got 3 things that are working to your advantage, and hence, why you see the firmness across all 3 regions of the world despite the currency impact that we're seeing as we report all of this in USD, as you know. But despite all of that, you see very, very firm pricing, and I think it's a reflection of who we are and what we do and where we're taking the business. You can't lose sight of the fact that what Charles and all of us believe right customer with a right application, and the right data center makes a huge difference. And if we can mitigate some of that churn by all the incremental services you're going to continue to see, I would argue, a very firm pricing on a go-forward basis.","Charles Meyers","Yes. I'd just reinforce that, Jordan. I think that when you look at -- that's one of the reasons why disciplined execution of the strategy, even though it's hard to drive the growth using -- with the smaller deal sizes, it requires significant volume and you've got to really drive the selling machine. It's the right thing to do, we think, in terms of generating long-term returns and value for our customers. And so we're really committed to that. ","And when we look at the broader industry, in terms of what people are seeing, in terms of, really, spreads, particularly people who are exposed to the wholesale -- primarily the wholesale, or even the Hyperscale market and what sort of at pricing looks like, current pricing versus what maybe the entry was and what therefore that implies for re-leasing spreads, it's not a, I think it's not always a pretty picture. And so, luckily, I think we have limited exposure to that on a relative basis for sure. ","And again, what we're seeing is essentially positive spreads because we're able to get the cumulative effect of PIs which we're very successful in implementing in our contract across huge number of contracts that are sort of rolling through the system. And even if that means that we do a price adjustment on a single contract on a net basis in the quarter, we're continuing to actually deliver more than sort of an overall positive price action. So that's really important dynamic in our business that I think is quite unique.","Operator","Our next question is from Aryeh Klein from BMO Capital Markets.","Aryeh Klein","Maybe related to the channel strength, how broad-based is that geographically? And is there an opportunity to further build out those relationships in new markets? And then separately, you are adding some meaningful new capacity next year in the Americas. Would you expect that to drive an acceleration in net cabinet adds in that market?","Charles Meyers","Yes. Great questions. The answer to both is probably a simple yes, but let me give you a little more color. I think, channel-wise, I do think we are able to continue to add both geographic coverage and coverage in terms of additional partner types that I think are going to be able to give us both increased reach. We, like many channel programs, see a bit of a sort of 80-20 rule, which is we see our 20% of our partners delivering a big chunk of our bookings. Although, it's interesting, we're seeing greater productivity across the full basis that we're starting to really get more breadth in the channel. So I do think both from a geographic standpoint and a partner-type standpoint, we're going to continue to add. ","But our focus is less on adding new partners as it is making our existing partners more productive. And so that's really -- and our team is really doing a great job all right that. I'm super excited about some of the -- some of our key channel partners. If you look at two of the major partners here in the U.S., with AT&T and with Verizon, both is really critical strategic partners of ours. And now, really, they're leaning on our data center portfolio as the key way to deliver into their customers. And so we're super excited about that and have seen a lot of momentum. ","And then also working with the hyperscalers themselves. And most of them are really seeing that their customers are saying, yes, we want to continue to consume more and more of your services, but we're doing it and we're integrating it with private infrastructure. And we want that private infrastructure to be immediately approximate to the cloud. And so that's really driving joint selling with the hyperscalers. ","And then the -- relative to your second question, on the Americas. Yes, I do think -- any time you add new capacity, I think you tend to see a little bit of uplift. And so hopefully we'll see some -- we typically contemplate some anchor customers inside of larger phases, and so you might see some lift there. But again, we're -- I do think that we'll be able to get a bit of lift on that. But what you're seeing, I think, in terms of cabinet adds, is really just the really tight discipline on the business, and then a really attractive mix profile.","Operator","Our last question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.","Ahmed Badri","I just wanted to follow up on the prior question. If you could just rank the regions that contributed or basically hit over this 30% hurdle rate that you guys reported this quarter from bookings, which regions were above the 30%? Which ones were below? And then I have a follow-up.","Charles Meyers","I don't know if I have that right off the top of my head. I expect that the Americas was meaningfully above that. And I'm not sure if the others were at or below the 30% in terms of their indexing. But I would say that from a trajectory standpoint, both APAC and Europe are really meaningfully increasing their percentage of bookings. ","I would expect they probably were both lower than 30s, and that U.S. was the over-indexed piece there, but I'd have to go back and confirm it. But I would tell you that I think all three regions continue to trend positively in terms of channel bookings as a percentage of overall.","Ahmed Badri","Got it. And then at what point do you think would be the limit or the ceiling to this contribution, right, from this kind of sales motion? Would it -- would you throw out like 40%, 50% of bookings any given quarter. Is that where this is going to top out? Or maybe you could give me any kind of idea on where we could expect this thing to top out in the future?","Charles Meyers","Yes. I think it's going to depend a little bit on how our business mix and new product portfolio continues to perform. Over time, I think that we're delivering digitally-enabled services, in some cases, like Network Edge. If you look at that service, it is one that should be able to be consumed by our customers directly and via channel partners with relatively limited friction. And I think that will enable us to increase the percentage of bookings that are done through our channel. I would say that we're still, at this point, more of a sell with sort of motion in our channel, and we're fine with that. We still get the expanded reach and relationship that those partners are giving us, and has very attractive economics. ","But I think that, over time, I think we'll have a combination where we're really getting sell-through activity on a broader portfolio. And I've said it in the past, there's no reason it can't be north of 50% for sure. And so I don't know what the timing of that is. I think it will depend on a variety of factors, but we're really encouraged by the trajectory we're seeing there because at the end of the day, the customer's trying to solve a problem. And very often, almost always, that problem means combining the value add of another player with the compelling value proposition of global reach ecosystems, interconnection and service excellence that Equinix brings to the table. And combining those and solving the needs of a customer is what fuels the business. And so we're really excited about that. I think there's a lot of upside potential for it.","Ahmed Badri","Great. And then one last question. Sorry to keep everybody on this call. But on stock-based compensation, Keith, could you probably just give us a little bit more color on how come stock-based comp grew 34% year-on-year and now makes up about 4.5% of revenues? Whereas, the same time last year, it was more around 3.5% or a bit above that? Can you just give any color on the recent increase and intensity? It's about the second quarter this happened. So just give us an idea for this quarter. And how do we...","Keith Taylor","Yes. That's what a strong stock price does, as you can appreciate. So I mean, think about where the stock was on December of last year and where it is today. And so I think the most important part is we look at not only our Compensation Committee, but certainly Charles and myself and Brandi, who runs HR with us. We're always looking at appeasing the burn. And it's very important, number one, that we look at compensation and we look at it on a relative basis to what we need to do to attract the right people into the organization. But we also look at the burn and how that affects our financial results, and then what I'm more referring to here is the AFFO on a per share basis. And so all of these things are considered as we figure out how to fund our business and drive value into the share. ","But no surprise to you, when the stock performed exceedingly well and you're growing a business, stock-based comp as a percent of revenue does go up. But that does not mean that dilution -- that we're diluting our stockholders anymore. It's just -- it's a reflection of what takes place. And as you look forward, of course, with the stock where it is, it's all about delivering value to an employee. And all else being equal, you would issue less shares next year because of the value of the stock as it is in its present form. So those are the thoughts I have. Happy to take it offline with you a little bit further, but there should be no surprise, our stock-based comp has been going up.","Katrina Rymill","Great. That concludes our Q3 call.

And good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. In Q2 we delivered both revenue and adjusted EBITDA above the top-end of our guidance ranges, as the disciplined execution of our strategy continues to drive momentum in our business.","As depicted on Slide 3, revenues were $605 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 14% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $275 million for the quarter, up 6% over the prior quarter. We achieved record bookings and delivered positive fundamentals, including firm MRR per cabinet, stabilized churn and healthy operating margins, reflecting the strength of Platform Equinix.","Interconnection revenue continue to outpace overall revenue, growing 16% year-over-year with cross connect growth driven across all verticals. With a strong focus on real-time applications, customers are taking advantage of a myriad of interconnection options we offer, to achieve higher levels of performance and enhance end-user experience.","In the quarter, we added 3,600 cross connects and 153 ports, and we now have over 135,000 cross connects and 2,400 ports connecting our customers with their customers and their partners. With over 100 data centers in 15 countries, our geographic footprint is unmatched and remains a unique differentiator, as we deliver on increasing demand for a consistent global offer.","Multi-region deployments continue to outpace single-region deployments, and are often associated with lower churn. Today, 66% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple regions, up from 62% last year and 80% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 78% last year.","Last week, we acquired the remaining minority interest in ALOG Data Centers for approximately $225 million, demonstrating our commitment to Latin America and our optimism about the future growth of this important market.","Turning to Slide 4. Equinix entered Brazil in early 2011, by acquiring a 53% majority stake in ALOG. ALOG is the leading carrier-neutral provider in Brazil, with approximately 1,500 customers across four data centers in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.","Since the initial investment, the ALOG business has exceeded our expectations and has grown revenue at a 24% CAGR for the past three years on a constant currency basis, while simultaneously expanding adjusted EBITDA margins over 500 basis points.","The ALOG team has done an outstanding job, leveraging the company's strengths in Brazil, specifically in cloud and mobility, and has benefited from many Equinix customers expanding their infrastructure into Brazil, including CenturyLink Technology Solutions, Level 3, Microsoft, Orange Business Services and Telef\u00f3nica, to mention a few. Latin America is an important market for us and we expect continued investment in this region.","Now, let me shift to an update on industry verticals. Secular and technology trends are making Equinix increasingly relevant to a larger universe of businesses, with over 4,600 customers, we are expanding and developing new ecosystems. This quarter, we passed a major milestone of having over 1,000 networks accessible on Platform Equinix. This network density combined with over 1,200 cloud and IT service providers is at the heart of value creation for our company.","The network vertical continues to deliver consistent growth, as we expand the wireline and wireless carriers, who are evolving to deliver cloud services and upgrading their infrastructure to 100-gig to support continued bandwidth demand.","In the financial services vertical, we continue to leverage our strong relationships in this market, establishing our leadership with trading exchanges, while also penetrating new sectors like electronic payments and insurance. This quarter, new wins include a leading global insurance broker, as well as Llyods of London, the world the world's specialist insurance market.","In the electronic trading sector growth continues, particularly in New York, London and Chicago, and financial represents our largest connected ecosystem outside of network. We see continued growth opportunity in this sector, as the digital transformation of trading moves to other asset classes, like foreign currencies and fixed income.","In the content\/digital media area, AD-IX ecosystem continues to grow, with over 100 customers participating in real-time, bid-based digital advertising, converging into eight geographic hubs worldwide. Other areas of the digital media domain are experiencing growth, ranging from established broadcasters, the new streaming platforms related to the explosion of IP video traffic, and we remain focused on developing ecosystems where Platform Equinix delivers unique value to this industry.\/","Tuning now to cloud. Well, cloud and IT service delivered record bookings and rapid revenue growth at 19% year-over-year. Cloud wins accounted for a-third of new customers, including wins from Clear Gov a government certified, cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service provider; Digital Ocean, a cloud hosting service; and VeloCloud, cloud wide-area network provider. In this segment, we see many companies deploying in multiple regions, including both emerging cloud service providers and leading providers, such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.","During the quarter, cloud players including Oracle, Workday, and Marketo expanded into additional global markets to capture the performance and user experience, benefits of customer proximity. This is creating a diverse inventory of providers across all regions, making Equinix even more attractive for these enterprises adopting cloud services.","Private interconnection is an increasingly popular access methodology for connecting to the cloud, as public IP proves insufficient for the performance of security demands of mission-critical applications. There is a growing recognition that cloud application performance and user experience can be enhanced by connecting privately to cloud services and bypassing the public internet.","Today, we offer private access to both fiber cross-connects and our Ethernet-based Cloud Exchange to over 50 cloud service providers, including AWS, Blue Box, Datapipe, GoGrid, IBM SoftLayer, Lucera and Microsoft Azure.","The Equinix Cloud Exchange are advanced interconnection solution that enables on-demand direct access to multiple clouds and multiple networks is now live in 17 markets globally. The physical presence of key cloud service provider nodes in these markets offers customers the ability to access these services via single-port interface inside an Equinix IBX with low-latency and enhanced security. This is an important differentiator for us as customers began moving workloads in and out of the cloud.","We are seeing rapid adoption of the Cloud Exchange from leading cloud, network and managed service providers and recently announced exchanged participants including Carpathia, EMC, Level 3, NetApp, Orange and TW Telecom.","Shifting now to enterprise. This segment is increasingly looking at distributed architectures as a mechanism for improved to cloud resources as well as the ability to improve the performance of their owned-IT infrastructure. As a result, we see enterprises moving certain application at a private data centers and into co-location facilities on a worldwide basis.","Launched earlier this year, the Equinix Performance Hub is an offering that extends enterprise IT infrastructure to the data center, allowing customers to create a private wide area network node inside Equinix, where they can host applications closer to end-users, optimize the network architectures and directly connect the multiple cloud and network providers.","Locating performance-sensitive elements of enterprise IT infrastructure inside Equinix creates the ability to accelerate application delivery and network performance and improve the end-users experience.","Often incorporated into a Performance Hub architecture is the Cloud Exchange, which further simplifies how enterprises manage connections between public cloud service and private cloud infrastructure, allowing on-demand interconnection to multiple cloud providers using one connection.","We are helping customers design and deploy these new architectures through Solution Architects and are also leveraging our Solution Validation Centers to run proof-of-concept test for many large enterprise companies. Test results show that enterprises on average save over 25% on network bandwidth cost with a Performance Hub implementation. With the added benefit of being able to securely transfer data from the backbone network to cloud providers available in our data centers.","We now have over 50 customers with Performance Hub deployment, and while still very early in the stages of adoption, we continue to land marquee accounts, including recent wins with Cerner, a leading provider for healthcare industry and MICROS Systems, a software and hardware solutions provider for the hospitality industry.","So let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith, who'll go through some results in the quarter.","Keith Taylor","Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. I'd like to start my section of the call by saying how pleased we are with the performance of the business, both for the current quarter and year-to-date.","The Equinix platform strategy is clearly going through to our operating results, driving strong growth with healthy returns. In the quarter, we experienced a number of record, related to our bookings activity, reflecting momentum in the business including the highest ever quarterly gross bookings for the company.","Record bookings for both EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions, record bookings in our cloud and IT services vertical. Also, the Americas region delivered its second highest gross bookings production of all time, including strong exports for the other two regions, demonstrating continued importance of our global offering.","Moving on to Slide 5 from our presentation posted today. Our global Q2 revenues increased to $605.2 million, a 4% increase over the prior quarter and up 14% over the same quarter last year. Our Q2 revenue performance reflects a $2 million positive currency effect when we compare to the average rates used in Q1, and a $1.1 million positive currency benefit when compared to the FX guidance rates. Our FX hedges offset the benefit of the positive currency rates by $1.8 million.","Non-recurring revenues increased 2% quarter-over-quarter, higher than our expectations driven by our continued focus on selling incremental value-added services to our customers, such as custom installation work. In addition, in the quarter we received $3 million in early termination fees. These payments were reported in non-recurring revenues, they're typically one-time in nature.","Interconnection revenues continue to outpace the overall revenue growth, increasing 16% over the prior year, as our comprehensive suite of interconnection solutions continues to drive healthy gross additions for both cross connects and exchange ports.","Separately, given the lengthening of the average life of our customer installations. What we see is a positive trend, we lengthened the period by which we amortize our deferred installation revenue from four years to four-and-a-half years, effective at the beginning of the second quarter.","This resulted in a $1.8 million negative impact to our Q2 revenues and EBITDA, and a $5.3 million decrease to our expected 2014 guidance. This reduction is a timing difference and the offsetting benefit will be recognized in 2015 and beyond. This change is fully absorbed in our revised guidance.","Total cash cost of revenues were consistent with our expectations, and cash SG&A expenses increased to $139 million for the quarter, including approximately $9 million of REIT-related cash costs.","Total adjusted EBITDA was $275 million, above the top-end of our guidance range and up 6% over the prior quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45%. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA performance reflects a $900,000 positive currency benefit when compared to the average rates used in Q1 and a $600,000 positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates.","Our Q2 net income was $11.3 million, including the loss and debt extinguishment of $51.2 million related to the convertible debt exchanges this quarter. Excluding this loss, our pro forma net income would have been $49.3 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.94, a 15% increase over the prior quarter and up 9% over our pro forma diluted earnings per share last year.","MRR churn was better than our expectations at 2.7%. This result includes the full impact of the LinkedIn churn that occurred at the end of Q2. As stated in our prior earnings call, the LinkedIn MRR churn had no meaningful impact in our Q2 revenues, but will reduce Q3 recurring revenues by $4 million. This has been fully contemplated in our guidance. We expect churn to decrease to 2.5% in Q3, and for the full year of 2014, we expect MRR churn to average approximately 2.5% per quarter.","Now moving on to our comments on REIT. We remain in active dialogue with IRS about our pending PLR request, and are pleased with current momentum. Also we continue to be on track with our plans to convert to REIT on January 1, 2015, and recently finished a major milestone with the completion of our financial system conversion earlier this month.","On Slide 6, we summarized various expected REIT-related cash cost and taxes. For the full year 2014, we now expect to incur approximately $35 million of cash cost and $18 million of capital expenditures on the REIT conversion. In the third quarter, we expect to incur approximately $8 million in REIT-related cash costs. For the year, our estimated cash tax liability is now expected to range between $145 million and $180 million.","Well, turning to Slide 7, I'd like to start reviewing the regional results, beginning with the Americas. Americas revenues increased 4% over the prior quarter and 10% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 6% over the prior quarter and 4% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis.","As a reminder, the Americas region continues to be fully burdened with corporate functions, including cost of the corporate projects such as REIT conversion and Equinix Customer One. Americas adjusted EBITDA margin was 46% for the quarter.","As announced last week, we're acquiring the remaining minority interest in ALOG for approximately $225 million. As a reminder, we already fully consolidate ALOG in our financial results. Americas net cabinets billing increased by 100 in the quarter, which includes the full impact from the LinkedIn churn.","Americas added 1,400 net cross connects this quarter, 6% above the prior four quarter trend. We also added 85 exchange ports in the quarter, a significant uptick compared to 2013, driven by demand from content and network providers. MRR per cabinet remains firm at very attractive levels. And while up 1% quarter-over-quarter, we expect this metric to remain stable going forward. Interconnection revenues as a percent of the regions recurring revenues remained at over 20%.","For new builds, we're proceeding with a third phase of our SV5 IBX build in Silicon Valley. This campus has one of two major peering locations in Silicon Valley and has had strong demand from both, network, cloud and content companies, resulting in attractive returns and firm pricing.","Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 8. EMEA revenues on a normalized and constant currency basis were up 4% quarter-over-quarter and up 15% year-over-year, and reflect strong performance in our Dutch and German businesses as well as an increase in the level of cross-regional deals for cloud.","Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 4% over the prior quarter and up 22% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin remains at 42%, due to a number of one-off adjustments booked in the quarter. Absent these adjustments, EMEA adjusted EBITDA would have been 44%.","EMEA interconnection revenues increased 8% over the prior quarter and up 39% over the same quarter last year, largely driven by the U.K. and German markets. We added 1,200 net cross connections in the quarter and net cabinets billing increased by approximately 900. Interconnection revenues as a percent of the regions recurring revenues increased to over 8%.","In addition to our expansion activity in London and Amsterdam, we're now moving forward with the next phase of our Paris 4 asset. With over 200 networks in Paris, this phased expansion will develop our position with cloud, network and enterprise customers.","Now looking at Asia-Pacific, please refer to Slide 9. In Asia-Pacific, we passed an important milestone by generating over $100 million of revenues in the quarter. For Q2, revenues were $105.7 million, a 6% increase on a normalized and constant currency basis over the prior quarter and up 22% over the same quarter last year, driven by strength in our content and cloud segments. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 8% over the last quarter and 24% over the same quarter last year.","Asia-Pacific added 67 new customers in Q2, 20% above the rolling four quarter average. MRR per cabinet remained strong and cabinets billing increased by 1,000 over the prior quarter. We added 1,000 net cross connects and interconnection revenues remained at 12% of the regions recurring revenues.","And now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $704 million of unrestricted cash and investments on our balance sheet, a decrease over the prior quarter level, primarily due to our share repurchase program and debt extinguishment activities.","Also in July, we funded the $225 million to purchase the minority interest in ALOG, which will further reduce our cash balance. Our net debt leverage ratio decreased slightly to 2.9x our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA.","Under the share repurchase program, we repurchased 1.8 million shares since last December, including 1.5 million shares in 2014 to date. Our repurchase investment totaled $347 million, leaving a $153 million of capacity under our program. In the second half of the year, we plan to continue to evaluate additional opportunities to optimize our capital structure.","Now, switching to Slide 11. Our Q2 operating cash flow decreased over the prior quarter to $99 million, primarily due to tax payments of $75 million related to both REIT and non-REIT related obligations, and $54 million of accelerated vendor payments due to our financial system conversion. We expect this offsetting benefit to be realized in Q3. Also our DSOs increased to 35 days, a trend we expect to reverse over the next few quarters.","For 2014, we're raising our guidance for AFFO to be greater than $740 million, due to increased expectations from adjusted EBITDA and lowering recurring CapEx. As a reminder, AFFO includes $35 million of REIT-related operating cost in 2014 and $9 million of cost related to the FX Customer One program.","In 2015, we expect our ongoing REIT-related cost to decrease to a range of $5 million to $10 million. We continue to expect our 2014 adjusted discretionary free cash flow to range between $620 million and $650 million, and adjusted free cash flow to be greater than $200 million, both of these metrics excluding any REIT-related cash cost or taxes.","And now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to Slide 12. For the quarter our capital expenditures were $160 million, including recurring capital expenditures of $27 million, in line with our prior guidance. We opened two new IBX phases in Hong Kong and Sao Paulo in the quarter. We currently have 12 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 10 are campus builds or incremental phase builds.","As announced at our Analyst Day, we revised the breakout of our ongoing capital expenditures to align with our AFFO calculation, and now refer to this component of AFFO with recurring CapEx. Slide 13, maps out the details of both recurring and expansion CapEx, which we believe more appropriately reflect the true reinvestments and maintenance rate of the business.","Since Analyst Day, we made some minor adjustments to our AFFO, slightly reducing recurring CapEx to reflect certain capital dollars, either increase revenue or reduce our cost. We will continue to review the components of AFFO, including recurring CapEx, through our reconversion date of January 1, 2015.","And finally, turning to Slide 14. The operating performance of our stabilized CC9 global IBX and expansion projects that have been open for more than one year continue to perform well with revenues increasing 7% on a year-over-year basis. Currently these projects are 81% utilized and generate a 32% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested consistent with our targeted range of 30% to 40%.","Now, let me turn the call back to Steve.","Stephen Smith","Thanks Keith. Let me now cover our outlook for 2014 on Slide 15. For the third quarter of 2014, we expect revenues to be in the range of $614 to $618 million. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $140 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $278 million and $282 million, which includes $8 million in costs related to the REIT conversion.","Capital expenditures are expected to be $175 million to $185 million, which includes approximately $25 million of recurring capital expenditures. For the full year of 2014, we are raising revenue to range between $2.425 billion and $2.435 billion or a 13% year-over-year growth rate, which includes $6.5 million of positive foreign currency benefit compared to our Q2 guidance range.","As a reminder, this guidance includes a $5 million decrease to both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, due to the change in accounting estimate. This is a non-cash change-only and result of a longer estimated life for customer installations.","Total year cash gross margins are expected to range between 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $550 million.","Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.105 billion and $1.115 billion, which includes $3 million of positive foreign currency benefit, compared to our Q2 guidance range, and also includes $35 million in cost related to our REIT conversion efforts. We expect 2014 capital expenditures to range between $600 million and $650 million, which includes approximately $115 million of recurring capital expenditures.","So in closing, I would tell you that discipline execution of our strategy continues to drive positive results and solid momentum in our business. Innovation, including customer-enablement solutions like Performance Hub and Equinix Cloud Exchange is further differentiating us from our competitors.","Our strategic priorities are focused on preserving and enhancing our competitive strengths. And we have the operating scale and financial strength to capitalize on our unique position to become the home of the interconnected cloud.","So let me stop here and open it up for questions. And Rachel, I'll turn it back over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Mr. Michael Rollins.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup","If I could ask one clarification and more of the business related question. On the clarification, for the FX for the third quarter, what would be the potential benefit in the guidance, not relative to prior guidance, but relative to the average second quarter rate. And then I'll follow-up with the business question.","Keith Taylor","That's $1.5 million, Michael.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup","And then just taking a step back, if you could talk a little bit more about the cloud initiatives and the enterprise focus? And since the Analyst Day, you're seeing incremental progress, and is that contributing to some of the strength in sales productivity?","Charles Meyers","Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Mike. It's Charles. Yes, I think that we certainly have seen incremental progress. Obviously, we're on steep part of the curve in terms of the advancement of our enterprise business, as well as, the overall dynamics of the cloud business in our industry overall and for us. And we continue to be very excited about how the cloud opportunity is playing out.","What we've seen, as we talked about at the Analyst Day, that really hybrid cloud has emerged as, I think pretty unequivocally the IT architecture of choice. And what we're seeing is, virtually, every CIO we speak with, whether that'd be service provider or enterprise, are saying that they plan to segment their workloads and utilize really a blend of public cloud, private cloud, owned infrastructure, et cetera, to really meet for what is a pretty wide range of cost reliability, security, performance requirements, et cetera.","And as they are moving away from sort of traditional homogenous infrastructures in their own data centers, they're really moving towards sort of a more modern cloud-based architecture and that is inherently multi-network, multi-cloud in nature.","And the other thing that's happening is that they are increasingly finding the private access to cloud resources are going to be required in order to satisfy the performance and security requirements. So we talked a little bit about that in the script in terms of really to architecting around the public internet and finding that that doesn't meet their needs. It's certainly does for some workloads, but for many that's not the case.","And so I think again, we are building off a heritage where similar to what we did in the evolution of internet pairing where there was no neutral, trusted, commercially set scalable mechanism available, that same dynamic result occurs now in the cloud environment. And we think Cloud Exchange really sort of meets that need. And so we are seeing great momentum.","I think that it's still early days, as we said in the script, we've seen a number of big marquee sort of lighthouse wins over the last several quarters. We're beginning to build, both our professional services and our channel capabilities to be more responsive to certain large complex enterprise needs.","And where we're seeing those winds, I wouldn't say an area of major contributor from a bookings perspective at this point. But we did see strength across the board in our other verticals and in our more mature ecosystems, which sort of combined into what we obviously feel like is a very strong and solid performance for the quarter.","Stephen Smith","The only thing I think I'd add, Charles, and I don't know if you mentioned it was that, I think we pointed to in the script, Mike, is that we're live in 17 markets globally today. And we'll push that to probably over 20 markets by the end of the year. So we've got interest coming from several customers to expand it to Sao Paulo to Osaka, to Melbourne two of our new sites, as well as in Zurich, which wasn't considered in the original 16 or 17.","So the demand is good. The pipeline is very large. And so we're working through all the challenges and requirements from our customers to make sure that we customize as much possible to get the implementation set up, but it's got a lot of momentum.","Charles Meyers","And maybe another data point in order to be mentioned in the script 50 cloud service providers that are available via private access mechanisms, either Direct Connect or through the Cloud Exchange. And we've got pretty concentrated business effort underway to stimulate that ecosystem. And in the same way, we have made a pretty good living by differentiating ourselves on network density. We're seeing the same thing sort of repeat itself on the cloud side.","And so we've got a big backlog of customers that we're trying to bring on to the Cloud Exchange and scale our interpretability efforts. And we already have enterprise customers that have joined the Exchange and already demonstrated the automated provisioning functionality of Cloud Exchange. So very exciting progress, and we're very pleased with it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Barden.","David Barden - Bank of America","I guess two, if I could. The first one would be just putting a little flesh on the bones on ALOG purchase. We're all seeing the $225 million go out the investing cash flows. Could you talk about the valuation difference between what you bought it for, what you think it's worth now, and kind of what we're going to see happen on the cash flow statement as a benefit for that $225 million going off out the door.","And then second, just on the North America cabinets billing, I think that it's been a noisy number. Last quarter we had the Level 3 cleanup. We had the Switch and Data lease expiration in the 111 8th Avenue. This quarter we've got LinkedIn. Could you talk about kind of an underlying core business momentum in the North American market that we can think about as being kind of the trend line for the second half of the year? That would be super helpful?","Stephen Smith","Great questions, Dave. So let me take the first one on ALOG. As you know, we paid $225 million for the remaining 47%, put that in perspective for the first 53% we paid roughly $60 million. So to give you a perspective of sort of the value that accreted into business over the three years, since we became involved in the deal.","And from a valuation perspective think of it as, we basically bought it for roughly our current trading multiple today, albeit with a much higher growth trajectory. And so I see that as the very positive transaction, not only for ourselves, but certainly for our partners.","And then release the financials, I think that you will see is you see of course the $225 million cash flow statement but we already fully consolidate this asset. And so what you're going to see on a go forward basis, is basically as a company you'll get a full benefit now, if you will, from the cash flow, but it's not going to have any meaningful changes to our financial statement.","Charles Meyers","This is Charles. I'll take the Americas business, particularly North American business. In a nutshell I'd say, we're very pleased with the momentum in progress of the business in North America. I think that as you said, it is in fact the MRR per cabinet earning about -- the billing cabinet is in fact a noisy number. And we would continue to caution you in that way that that it tends to bounce around a little bit based on timing of the install and other factors of large deals. And so we will probably continue to see some of that volatility.","But again, I think if we look at it over a longer period of time, we see a solid upward trend, and we believe we'll continue to see that. And I think again, it's based on momentum across a range of portions of the business. We are seeing lower average deal sizes, as we talked about in terms of multi-tiered architectures, et cetera.","This quarter we did actually see a number of larger implementations associated with some cloud wins, which was partially fueling some of the bookings strength that we saw. But across the board, the verticals are performing well, funnel continues to grow, interconnection activity at record levels, and again I think that's driving strong yield numbers.","We are, as we talked about, at a very, very attractive level of yield in the Americas. And I think we would hope to continue to sustain those levels. But again, I think overall we're seeing solid momentum and good performance in the Americas business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Just touching on CapEx a little bit, it moved at sort of towards the higher end of the range. Is that reflecting some spend on Silicon Valley and Paris, the new expansions, or is that mostly 2015 spend, any color around that? And then on M&A, did you do anything on the land or facilities purchases during the quarter? Where does that stand today? And any thoughts about entering new markets beyond your current footprint?","Keith Taylor","Why don't I take the first question, Simon, just on CapEx. Certainly, we have announced some incremental builds that are taking place. At the start of the year we look at -- again, CapEx is reported on a cash basis. We looked at a range of $550 million to $650 million.","Now, that we're getting to the latter part of the year, we've been able to tighten that range, because we have a much better idea of what cash is going to flow-in and flow-out of the system, if you will, in the fiscal period. So part of it just really tightening it. But to suggest though, that we have decided to make some incremental investments as you alluded to.","And Paris is the one that that comes at the forefront there, where we're going to spend a little bit of incremental capital to build out the next phase of our Paris 4 asset. And then Silicon Valley, again that asset is going to be build out over a period of time, both 2014 and 2015. So the majority of that investment will be made -- sorry, the majority of cash outflow will be made in 2015.","Stephen Smith","On your M&A question, Simon, no real change in the historic representation about where we're looking in expanding the platform. It's predominantly in Asia and Europe. I would tell you in the U.S. market, domestic U.S., where we feel like we're in very good shape. As I alluded to in the script, I think in Latin America, I think as Karl Strohmeyer and his team continues to advance our strategy down there, there maybe more opportunity in the future in that part of the Americas business.","But in Asia probably, it presents the biggest opportunity to go deeper into China, continue to stare at India. Korea continues to be an interesting market to watch. So no real change on the big markets that we're looking at in terms of M&A geographic orientation.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","And any opportunities to buy any of your facilities?","Charles Meyers","Simon, we continue to look at the opportunities, and as I sort of talked about at the Analyst Day, we're going to look at them sort of just based on what presents itself over a period of time. And I'd tell you, it doesn't always make sense for us, because we do have the economic control over many of our assets for an extended period of time. And to the extent something does present itself, we will look at it. And so there's a few things that are on the table, but there is nothing that's sort of worthy of announcement at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co.","Two questions, if I may. One on growth, just kind of going back to your Analyst Day when you put out the guidance long-term for I think greater than the markets growth of 10%, and then I compare that with increase that you've given today to your revenue growth and what that implies.","I'm just going back to conversation I remember having with Steve about how, if the cloud actually played out the way you guys expected, you thought that could actually lead to an acceleration in growth. And I'm just curious if you think that you're seeing ultimately that 10% guidance that you gave was really meant just to be floor more than anything else.","And then also for Keith, just specific to a comment you made in your script, where you noted that you're also looking at other ways to optimize the capital structure. I was wondering if you could expand on that and perhaps give a timeframe for what it is you're thinking about?","Stephen Smith","Why don't I start on the cloud question, Colby, or on the growth question? I would tell you, yes, the way we represented ourselves at Analyst Day was that to grow at or above market growth rate was in that high-single digit, call it low-double digit growth at the industry. We wanted to be at or above that growth rate.","I think what you are starting to see now in the raised guidance is the cloud-enabled enterprise starting to play itself out. So we are, as Charles alluded to, we are dead in the middle of all the public private hybrid cloud players in the market, trying to get them to come in, and put access nodes, network nodes, all over these data centers to attract enterprise to come in.","It's very early days, as Charles said. But there really isn't a deal in our pipeline that's not affiliated with how do I figure out how to start taking advantage of the cloud. And so it's unfolding, the on ramps are building, the off ramps are building, and I would call it the guidance predominantly behind our cloud-enabled activities to attract enterprises and the big cloud players themselves. I don't know if you want to answer that. Charles?","Charles Meyers","No. Again, I think the posture that we articulated at Analyst Day remains intact that that is a level that we felt we could be comfortable with, without taking any kind of undue assumptions about the magnitude and timing of certain trends that we are seeing begin to take shape play out. And are we optimistic about that? Do we see early sign of success? Are we getting light house wins? Yes.","For example, reflected in behind that success we're investing, as Keith articulated in making accelerated investment in our channels, which is in the second half of the year here to prepare for what we see as continued success in '15. And we certainly hope and believe that that may have the opportunity to invigorate growth in the business. But I think that our posture remains the same as it was in Analyst Day. We're being appropriately prudent in terms of what we're committing out there, and like again, seeing very good times.","Keith Taylor","The second part of question was around the capital structure. I think there was a number of levers that the company will continue to look at to optimize capital structure. Number one, we saw the $153 million left in our share repurchase program. We will opportunistically look at what and when to buy incremental shares as those opportunities present themselves. That would be one.","Number two, we'll continue to occur convertible instruments. But one of the things we've been trying to do with our converts is get them into the equity base, partly due to the fact that there's dilutive aspects to what occurs, if you don't get it into the equity base in a timely fashion, and sort of we're very, very pleased with the historical transactions that we've done. As we have offset, I mean the amount of dilution that would otherwise have happen.","So we'll continue to look at our convergence. And again, asses whether it probably makes sense, again the deal where we're focused on is going to be a net present value positive transaction for us, and we're going to drive more AFFO with the system. And is it in fact a good economic decision, both for ourselves and presumably the people that are sitting on the other side of the table from us.","And then the third piece plays, as I said, cash balance was $704 million, but when you take out the $225 million for the ALOG acquisition, you're at some $500 million of cash. And then we obviously have some payments to make through the latter part of the year, whether it's the E&P Purge or other tax payments. And so we're going to be very mindful of our cash balance.","So the team is quietly looking at how to capitalize the business on go-forward basis. And one of the things that we would sort of somewhat communicate the market to already is we'll look for straight debt. We said if there is a debt transaction that would make sense, and we need to raise capital and will certainly be active in the market.","But there is no urgency. I think by the end of the year just give you -- I think, if you will, we'll probably end the year somewhere between all else being equal between $300 million and $400 million of cash on our balance sheet. And so we're still on a very sort of comfortable position from a liquidity perspective, particularly in the operating line of credit.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Mike McCormack.","Mike McCormack - Jefferies","I was thinking, it would be impossible that Windstream got a PLR before you guys did. A couple of questions, just thinking about I guess pricing and competition. But with respect to your various customer segments, can you just make a comment on sensitivity to pricing across those segments? And then secondly, just maybe some comment regarding the wholesale side, what you're seeing from their entry into retail as well as any Open-IX initiatives?","Charles Meyers","Mike, this is Charles. I'll take that. I think pricing is often times -- although, there are probably some segments that has certain characteristic relative to their appetite for quality, reliability and service delivery and end-user experience that maybe less price sensitive on overall basis.","And really I think the way we look it more typically is around applications and workloads. In that, where customers really value sort of the network density, performance benefits, global reach and mission critical reliability, et cetera that Equinix delivers. That's where we see quite rational decision on their part and willingness to sort of pay for the value that they get.","And so again, I think there are probably some segments of the market that have greater levels of price sensitivity certainly. But what they have typically done in that is looked to tier their architectures as a way to meet their needs at lower cost. And that's one of the dynamics that we've seen impact the business. I think we are well ahead of that trend now in terms of understanding what application types are really going to work and really extract value or leverage the value that Equinix delivers.","And in terms of from a competitive perspective, wholesale, as I've said, again and again for the most part, wholesalers play in a different level, in a different portion of the market. The wholesale, the large footprint portions wholesale are really going after that third-tier of the architecture.","And very often, we are working with customers to combine purchase decisions they made for wholesale footprint with more mission critical, performance-sensitive elements of the architecture that are housing side of Equinix. And one of the things our Solution Architecture's doing are helping them develop those multi-tiered architectures and helping them develop them in a way that they can really leverage the benefits of hybrid cloud.","And relative to Open-IX, again I went into some depth in that last couple of earnings calls. And we're not seeing any meaningful impact in our business. We continue to feel very good about the value proposition we deliver to our customers on our exchange. And I think the port adds that we've had and the acceleration of those port additions this year, really I think are a reflection of the competitiveness of our offering in the market.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Amir Rozwadowski.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital","From my side, I wanted to ask specifically about sort of the churn levels. I think they came in slightly better than expected. I would love to hear your thoughts in terms of how we should expect that trajectory going forward? I mean you folks continue to have gained notable traction in some of the international markets. I was wondering with respect to Europe, do you continue to see some capacity constrained in that market? I would love to hear your thoughts around competitive dynamics within that region?","Charles Meyers","Maybe I'll take the first one, Steve, and you can pick up on Europe. From a churn perspective, again, we did come in slightly better than what we had guided to last quarter. And we did absorb the full LinkedIn into that number. So we saw a slight uptick, but not as much as we had anticipated.","Some of that is probably timing. And as is often the case, some times the specific timing of churn isn't really precisely known and things can slip from one quarter into the next. And then probably some churn that we anticipate it could occur that we found a way commercially that we thought was attractable to maintain that business.","But I think that generally, the 2.5% that we've guided to is an area that we feel comfortable in, as we've referred to it sort of a level of frictional churn that accommodate some of the realities in the market. Because as we said, there are continued and natural evolutions of people's infrastructure that they make towards more multi-tiered, sophisticated infrastructures, and that often does result in a level of turning in migration out of Equinix in some cases.","Since 2.5% is a level that we're pretty comfortable with, we are happy with the performance this quarter. We probably did see some deferrals, but again that's probably the level that we're comfortable with, but always working to improve that. And I think the important piece is, as we've always said, getting the right business in the door upfront is our best defense against elevated churn down the road, and our teams are doing a great job of disciplined execution in the field.","Stephen Smith","Thanks, Charles. And I think on the European question, I would tell you that our team in Europe tells and continues to signal that the economy remains challenged. But even within that environment, just in this quarter, as Keith alluded to, we had record bookings in EMEA, and we exceeded all our internal targets, very strong performance in the Netherlands and Germany.","And as you know, a differentiator we have versus our competitors is we're inbounding a lot of bookings from our Americas and Asia business into that region. So there is an advantage, obviously that our team has from our global bookings.","Interconnection is up to 8% of revenue now, so they're doing a very good job on that. I think we're separating ourselves from our competition with the Cloud Exchange that we've launched in those European markets. Pipeline looks very good, coverage ratios look good, cloud ecosystem is unfolding and our footprint in Europe. So MRR per cap this quarter was up $24. So there is a lot of positive signals in Europe this quarter versus the competition. So I would say there is any big change, it's still a very competitive market with the players that you're well aware of. But we're continuing to scale and build the core of our ecosystem strategy there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets","So a financial question and then a cloud question. On the guidance hit in the flow-through to EBITDA, the higher revenue guide, what would impede some of the margin expansion that you're guiding to? You referenced the REIT conversion cost, the one-time projects, is there anything else that is impeding some of the EBITDA margin growth? And then, in terms of cloud connectivity demand overall as a category, just manifest itself as is cloud existent [Technical Difficulty] traction, does that manifest itself more in exchange port growth or cloud connect growth?","Keith Taylor","Jonathan, we're going to do two things here. I can answer the first question, but we're going to have to ask you to repeat the second question, because your line had broken up in proportionally. So we didn't get the full question. But as it relates to the guidance and takes the flow-through from revenue to EBITDA, whether you're looking at Q3 or for the total year, there is a number of things that are going on.","And certainly, as I alluded to in my comments, first and foremost there is $3 million of early termination fee payments. One was up $2 million payment to one customer. So as those things don't typically recur on a very regular basis, and so we lose the benefit of that in Q3 and certainly that's one thing that affects the flow-through.","The second thing that's impacting us is the deferred installation adjustment that I spoke of and Steve alluded to. Again, when we make those type of adjustments, it doesn't do anything to cash flow, but has a direct drop from the revenue line all the way down to EBITDA line, and as we said there is $5.3 million of hit to the year with respect to that.","If I summarize it, well, the things there that are changing that you should -- if I take out the noise and I normalize everything, the one thing that I would tell you, there is two incremental cost that are coming into the system that we hadn't previously guided to. And one of them is higher utility. So normally from a volume perspective, so you see our revenues coming up and we're consuming more. And as a result, we're going to incur higher utilities than we originally anticipated and some of that is pricing. And I think of that for the year at roughly $4 million.","And the other thing that we've talked about is channel. We expect to spend roughly another $3 million or expect to invest $3 million in channel in the latter half of the year, roughly $1 million in Q3 and $2 million in Q4. So that's $3 million of cost that we didn't originally anticipate. So when you adjust for all of that and you look at the flow-throughs, basically the numbers all work out, and work out with a consistent flow-through based on the revenue flow-through.","Stephen Smith","Your question was on with the interconnection uptick that we've seen it mostly in cross connects or port or both, is that the nature of your question?","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets","Well, just cloud in general. If that continues to grow as you anticipate, does that growth manifest itself more in exchange port growth or cross connect growth?","Charles Meyers","Yes.","Stephen Smith","I mean, we're going to see in both. And Charles probably has a point or two. I'll you give you a couple fact away that will give you a sense of it. With the numbers I gave you in the script, we added 3,600 cross connects this quarter and 153 ports. So 3,600 cross connects, roughly 1,400 in Americas, roughly 1,300 EMEA and just under 1,000 in Asia. So you can see we've got good geographic coverage on the cross connect growth.","And then there is port growth everywhere, but we have actually -- in the vicinity of 3,700 direct access cloud cross connects that have been accumulated here since we've been focused on the cloud, it gives you a kind of an order of magnitude that how much cloud density cross connects we're starting to see. But my guess, Charles, we're going to see it coming out of both channels.","Charles Meyers","Absolutely. In fact, I guess what I would say is that one of the reasons why I think customers are finding Platform Equinix such a compelling platform to sort of base their hybrid cloud strategy off of, is because of the flexibility that it provides in matching workload to certain requirements.","And so by implementing a performance out for example and attaching into cloud exchange, people can segment their workloads and say, hey, look, I've got workloads that actually are well-suited to putting into a public cloud environment over public internet. And by the way, they can do that very easily from within an Equinix facility and that would drive exchange ports.","But increasingly over time, what we see is they're saying, look there are certain things that from a security or throughput perspective, I need something different. And so that's where our private access really portfolio comes in and they can either do that over a fiber cross connect, which we see a lot of uptick on or they now can begin to do that in an automated fashion over Cloud Exchange. And so over time it will drive Cloud Exchange ports and virtual circuit that are provisioned over that Cloud Exchange. So we expect over time that we will see that full portfolio of interconnection continue to grow, as people really play out there hybrid cloud strategy.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners","So I guess my first question would be on the book-to-bill or the commencement lag. I know last quarter we saw some unusual extensions. I was wondering if you give a little color on what happened in this quarter and what you're expecting for the remainder of the year.","And then, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about sort of the professional services that you guys were delivering, I felt that was a very interesting part of your Analyst Day presentation. And since then we've been starting to think about how you're rolling that out, whether you're charging for it separately or has it become part of the sales process and package and whether there are any sort of longer-term margin implications?","Keith Taylor","I'll take book-to-bill, Jonathan, and then I will pass the other one on to Charles or Steve. Certainly, when you look at the performance of the booking activity this past quarter, again very, very healthy bookings across our entire portfolio. And so the one thing I'll leave you with is, there is a fairly large, a lot of that happened in the third month of the quarter again. Again, even though it was maybe a more smoother quarter than was historically you've seen, we still had a lot of activity taking place in the month of June. So when I look at my book-to-bill perspective that will continue, that will feather into the system in Q3 and Q4.","And so I want to give you maybe a hard point of view, when I think about incremental revenue that we'll see, and I'm adjusting for the one-off, the early termination fees, but I think about what's going to happen in Q3 relative to what happened in Q2. We're probably going to see more and more sort of organic revenue flow-through in Q3 than we saw in Q2.","And likewise, as I look into Q4 versus what happens in Q2, again it's going to be up a light level from Q3 performance. All that to say is I think the book-to-bill cycle is starting to, there are some things that were in our backlog coming out of Q1, we're starting to see that relieve itself. And so I feel very good, more about a more consistent book-to-bill interval going forward.","Charles Meyers","And then on pro service side, Jonathan, I'd say, still early days for us there. Today, the reality is that that we've significantly ramped our Solution Architect team, which is a bit filling that void in working with customers who we see as having significant opportunities and sort of filling in bit of that gap in terms of working with them on designing their infrastructure.","And in particular, on Performance Hub implementations and helping customers understand the benefits on how to go about implementing a Performance Hub. And that's pretty typical I think of the way you would see in that sort of technology maturity cycle is, as those types of very highly technical resources doing that early on.","But I think as we evolve, we would begin to envision a billable organization, billable threshold services organization delivering sort of packaged professional services type engagements to customers to very quickly assess and roll out some of those services.","And over time, I think that we'll probably evolve from, we're doing those, a significant number of those with perhaps resources ourselves. And then we will actually start to engage partners, because we think we'll get a lot of leverage in the partner channel, we'll able to deliver those similar types product services.","And over time that will move from sort of Performance Hub design into hybrid cloud type implementations on a broader scale, networking WAN optimization, and also continued services around data center migration. So those are all sort of areas of focus that we would have. It's still pretty early days, but we are starting to see customers really view us as a trusted advisor in looking at how to implement private hybrid cloud.","Katrina Rymill","That concludes our 2Q call.

Smith","Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report that Equinix delivered strong business and financial results in the fourth quarter, and another year of solid revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for 2011. As depicted on Slide 4, revenue grew 32% to $1.607 billion for the year, and adjusted EBITDA increased 36% to $738 million, consistently outperforming market growth rates. Our business is running in all cylinders, driven in large part by the strong demand we are experiencing for Platform Equinix across all verticals, and our market is healthy with favorable supply-demand dynamics and pricing remains firm. ","We are executing on our goal of generating over $3 billion in annual revenues by 2015, while targeting positive adjusted free cash flow in 2013. We're also implementing shareholder-friendly actions. In November, we announced intentions to deploy up to $500 million for the direct benefit of shareholders, which includes a share repurchase program of up to $250 million through the end of 2012. I'm pleased to report in 2011, we repurchased 870,000 shares for a total of $87 million. ","Turning to Slide 5. I'd like to highlight how we invested in the business in 2011. We generated $587 million in cash from operations for the year, and reinvested $557 million in 20 key global IBX expansions with the same level of targeted returns. Ongoing CapEx was $128 million for the year, which included success-based installations, maintenance and value-enhancing initiatives. We now have over 6.5 million gross square feet of space, which is the largest retail data center footprint in the world. Other successes for the year include achieving 99.9999% of availability across the global platform, increasing interconnection revenue by over 20% ending the year with over 97,000 cross-connects, and growing Internet exchange traffic over 30% to 1.4 terabits per second. ","In 2011, we also launched the Marketplace, a global portal that makes it easier for customers to conduct business with each other and quickly establish interconnections in our centers. The more interconnections that are created among our customers, the more valuable our ecosystems and our IBX has become. At the heart of demand for data center services is the exponential growth in IP traffic, video and performance-sensitive applications including financial trading, e-commerce, cloud and WAN optimization. Over the next decade, market sources expect a number of servers worldwide to grow by a factor of 10, the amount of information managed by a factor of 50 and the number of files by 75x. As we enter this new age of hyper-connectivity and data growth, Equinix will benefit by providing the right infrastructure and the right locations to achieve the performance requirements of these mission-critical applications. ","Networks are at the core of this infrastructure. The broad choice of networks and network services inside our data centers is a critical reason digital ecosystems are thriving at Equinix. Networks are rapidly introducing new products to support cloud infrastructure, CDN capabilities and managed services, taking advantage of the unique revenue opportunity to sell services inside of Equinix. ","During 2011, we saw several Cable MSOs in major networks upgrade their infrastructure in our centers, and we won several new service aggregation nodes. Carriers locate these nodes, which contain their main transmission and routing gear, near other network nodes inside our IBXs to make traffic hand-off as easy and cost-effective as possible. In turn, these nodes attract additional networks and increase our overall network density. Once established, these dense network sites are difficult to displace as peering and private networking hubs. The more network-dense our sites become, the more pull-through effect we have with critical ecosystems including financial services, cloud and digital media. ","I'd like to spend a minute explaining how data growth and application performance requirements are influencing customer architectures. As customers grow in sophistication and skill, they often evolve to a multi-tier architecture deployment as shown on Slide 6. Many of our target market segments including cloud, mobile data and digital media, have multi-tier deployments. Let me explain what this means. ","The first tier includes highly distributed network nodes to effectively manage network costs and improve latency. The middle tier includes larger service access nodes to deliver performance-sensitive applications at the edge of the network. The third tier in this architecture is comprised of large scale compute, storage or back-office applications that are less performance-sensitive. This final tier is typically served by wholesale or customer-built data center. ","In the first tier, as depicted on the top of the slide, customers leverage Equinix to distribute their network access nodes which rely on network density to efficiently transport traffic and ensure a positive end-user experience, while substantially saving our network costs. These network nodes are smaller implementations that are highly interconnected and deploy across multiple IBX locations. ","The middle of this multi-tier architecture typically consists of service aggregation nodes. These applications are mission-critical to an organization, very sensitive to performance, typically revenue-facing and demand a high quality of service. They also require access to ecosystem partners and customers across their digital supply chain so they can trade traffic efficiently and cost effectively. These deployments are substantially larger, often 50 or more cabinets deployed across a smaller number of IBX locations. ","The third tier houses large footprint compute server farms or storage arrays for applications that are less latency-sensitive. These deployments are very large and housed primarily on wholesale or customer-built data centers. The first 2 tiers are the sweet spot for Equinix, and where we deliver the highest value for customers. While wholesale data centers serve a different market than Equinix's core target, it is an important element of a customer's architectures and an offering that is complementarity to the Equinix value proposition. ","There are a couple of misperceptions related to multi-tier architecture deployments, especially with regards to supply. Some believe, for example, that if supply grows in the wholesale segment, it may adversely affect the part of the data center market where we operate. This isn't the case. Many of our customers already use multiple data center providers choosing the right location and services for the application they are deploying. And they come to Equinix when they need global reach, low latency, network choice and ecosystem access that others can't provide or replicate. ","This highlights the strength and defensibility of our ecosystem-centric business model as wholesale data center supply grows, when other key business drivers supporting our growth is the paradigm shift to cloud computing, as it rapidly heads towards a $100 billion market. ","Equinix now has over 300 pure-play cloud service providers, and we are seeing strong interest from CIOs looking to evolve their infrastructure to fully leverage the cloud. CIOs are facing the daunting task of being responsive to a rapidly changing application environment while simultaneously managing tight IT budgets. In response, visionary CIOs are embracing hybrid IT infrastructure models that leverage increasingly capable public cloud services while implementing private clouds for targeted applications and still continuing to invest in their own infrastructure. ","As shown in Slide 7, Equinix is uniquely positioned of the de facto cloud hub simultaneously empowering our customers with 3 things. One, Direct Connect access to public cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services; two, a rapid implementation platform for private clouds through Equinix's Internet Exchange, Ethernet Exchange or rich range of private networking options; and three, ample capacity for expansion of customer managed applications with superior performance in mission-critical reliability. By providing this one-stop environment for hybrid cloud infrastructure, Equinix is able to help CIOs lower network costs, improve security and deliver a superior experience to their end-users. ","Throughout 2012, Equinix will look to extend our lead as the cloud enabler by offering access to a wider range of public cloud services and a compelling choice of other cloud-based applications housed within Platform Equinix. ","So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to review the financials for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor","Thanks, Steve. And good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'm pleased to provide you with additional details on the fourth quarter results, including an update on the regional performance. With the exception of our financial results, all other metrics will exclude the impact of ALOG. ","So starting with Slide 9 that we posted today in our presentation. Financial results for Q4 were ahead of our expectations, and we remain focused on building the business around key verticals and ecosystems. Global Q4 revenues were $431.3 million, including $17.3 million attributed to ALOG, a 3% quarter-over-quarter increase and up 25% over the same quarter last year. A strong performance was offset by the negative currency headwinds experienced throughout the quarter. Quarterly revenue was negatively impacted by $7.6 million when compared to the average rates used in Q3, but $3.1 million when compared to our FX guidance rates. Quarter-over-quarter, revenues grew greater than 5% on a constant currency basis and, once again, reflect the strength in our operating model. Our pricing remains firm across each of our regions. Global MRR churn was approximately 2%, consistent with our expectations and within our targeted range, again, demonstrating the long-term nature of our customer relationships. ","Looking forward, we expect global MRR churn to average about 2% per quarter in 2012, but it is important to note that MRR churn can fluctuate. Global cash gross profit for the quarter was $287.8 million or cash gross margin of 67% higher than our initial expectation. The result of stronger-than-expected revenues and a lower-than-planned utility cost. Global cash SG&A expenses were $89.7 million for the quarter, consistent with our guidance and reflect the full impact of our sales, marketing and IT initiatives. Global adjusted EBITDA was $198.1 million for the quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46% and reflects FX -- and reflects a negative FX impact of $3.1 million when compared to the average rates used in Q3, a $1.6 million reduction when compared to our FX guidance rates. ","For the quarter, our global net income was $17.8 million or an earnings per share of $0.35 on a fully diluted basis. Looking forward, the U.S. dollar exchange rate used for Q1 and for 2012 guidance are $1.31 to the euro, $1.57 to the pound, and Singapore $1.26 to the U.S. dollar. Our updated global revenue breakdown by currency for the euro and pound is 13% and 8%, respectively, and the Singapore dollar represents about 5% of our revenues. ","Turning to Slide 10. I'd like to review our regional results starting with the Americas. Americas revenues grew 3% quarter-over-quarter to $277.5 million. Cash gross margins increased to 69%. Adjusted EBITDA was $133 million, an increase of 4% over last quarter, and up over 30% from the same quarter last year. Americas adjusted EBITDA margin was 48% for the quarter, including fully absorbing the corporate SG&A cost and continues to scale with the growth of our business. ","As we analyze the Americas business for the year, it is clear to us their performance is a precursor of what we expect from each of our regions as we scale to size. In 2011, the Americas region generated roughly $500 million in adjusted EBITDA. The region invested approximately $240 million in expansion and ongoing CapEx, resulting in about $260 million of unlevered cash being generated. The success of the Americas region highlights its ability on a standalone basis to fully absorb the corporate functions and the annualized corporate interest burden of about $190 million while still generating a meaningful amount of free cash flow. The success in the Americas highlights the free cash flow potential of both our EMEA and AP regions. ","Continuing on our Americas review, net cabinets billing increase by over 500 in the quarter, a lower sequential growth that experienced in Q3. This reflects the quarterly fluctuations that we have experienced due to timing of bookings and the installation intervals. The Americas sales force had solid bookings in Q4 with especially strong performance in the financial and network segments. Deal size and overall pricing continue to trend positively as we target value-aware customers. ALOG performed to plan despite the strengthening U.S. dollar, and ended the year with both a large backlog and a strong sales funnel. ","During the quarter, cross-connects for the Americas increased by over 1,200 with strong interconnection ads in Dallas and New York. Interconnection represents 20% of the region's recurring revenues. ","Finally, we announced 2 new builds for the Ashburn market, our most network-dense campus. We're starting new construction on DC11, as well as commencing the second phase of our DC10 business suite offering. This offering is gaining traction with customers who require a larger footprint that can be directly connected and fully integrated into our existing IBX infrastructure. ","Now looking at EMEA. Please turn to Slide 11. EMEA had a strong quarter and bookings were on target for the quarter and year, despite a negative economic backdrop and the currency fluctuations for the region. Revenues were up 3% sequentially or 8% on a constant currency basis, the result of continued growth across the region and lower regional churn. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $39.7 million or an adjusted EBITDA margin of 42%, a 5% improvement over prior quarter, and up 43% compared to the same quarter last year. ","The region's net billing cabinets increased by over 500. We added 1,600 cross-connects, a significant increase over the prior quarter. This reflects the continued success we are experiencing with our focus in key verticals and ecosystems. Interconnection increased to greater than 4% of the region's recurring revenues. ","Our top European market was London, followed closely be Amsterdam and Frankfurt. London success, in part, is driven by our strong traction with the financial community, highlighted by the continued demand for our London campus. This strength allows us to proceed with the third phase of our London 5 IBX. ","We also announced we won a super-core site with NL-ix, one of the world's leading Internet exchanges, to be deployed in our new Amsterdam 3 facility which opened in Q3. The new node will enhance traffic performance for Equinix customers enabling them to peer and improved performance while reducing their costs. The Dutch business and the new Amsterdam 3 facility positions us well to enable customer growth in one of Europe's fastest growing and network-rich markets. ","And now looking at Asia-Pacific. Please refer to Slide 12. Asia-Pacific revenues improved 4% sequentially or 6% on a constant currency basis, with strong net bookings across each of our countries. Adjusted EBITDA was $25.5 million, down slightly due to onetime expansion and negative FX trends over the quarter, but up 37% over the same quarter last year. Singapore and Sydney are performing extremely well and we're proceeding with new construction initiatives in both markets. We expect to open our Sydney 3 Phase 2 project in Q4 of this year, and our Singapore 2 Phase 4 should open in Q1 of 2013. Cabinets billing increase by almost 580 over the prior quarter and unit pricing remained steady. Interconnection revenues in the region increased 6% quarter-over-quarter and represent 12% of the region's recurring revenue. ","During the quarter, Asia-Pacific added 670 cross-connects. And now looking at the balance sheet data, please refer to Slide 13. Our unrestricted cash and investment balance is $1.1 billion. Clearly, we continue to be well-positioned from a liquidity perspective. As planned, we expect to use $250 million of this cash to sell our 2012 convertible debt principal to avoid future dilution. Our DSO decreased in the quarter to 30 days and remains at the low end of our expectations. ","Looking at the liability side of the balance sheet, our quarter end gross debt was $3.1 billion. Our Q4 net debt leverage ratio was 2.6x our Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA, and our overall cash cost to borrowing is 6.15%. ","We're keeping our net leverage target at 3 to 4x adjusted EBITDA. Over the short term, we expect to maintain our leverage at or near the low end of this range, yet remain comfortable in managing the business up to 4x net leveraged under the appropriate circumstances. ","Now looking at Slide 14. The cash flow attributes of the business continued to be very positive, in fact, nicely to our adjusted EBITDA metric. On an unlevered basis, which excludes cash interest, our operating cash flow is slightly over 100% of adjusted EBITDA. In 2011, we generated operating cash flows of $587 million, the results of strong operating performance and solid working capital management. ","Our Q4 discretionary free cash flow was approximately $143 million or almost $3 per share, a 24% increase over the prior quarter and better than expected. We expect our 2012 discretionary free cash flow to increase our range between $500 million and $540 million, or approximately range between $10 and $11 per share depending on the weighted average basic share count over the year. ","On a separate note, our current federal NOL balance available to offset future taxable income was approximately $450 million at the end of the year. And we do not expect to pay any meaningful cash taxes until 2014 or even possibly 2015. Our cash tax rate for 2011 increased approximately 16%, largely due to some foreign subsidiaries fully utilizing their NOLs. ","Looking at capital expenses, please refer to Slide 15. For 2011, our capital expenditures were approximately evenly split across all 3 regions, highlighting the growth we expect in both our EMEA and AP regions. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $190 million, slightly above our expectations, and largely due to the timing of cash payments on our Frankfurt-2 and our New York-5 expansion projects. Also ongoing capital expenditures were $44 million, higher than our initial guidance, and reflect an increase in installation and success-based spending, higher capitalization of IT projects, and an increase in capital allocated to ALOG. ","Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to update you on the operating performance of our 22 North America IBXs and expansion projects that have been opened for more than one year. Currently, these projects are 83% utilized and generate a 32% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested, in line with our targeted 10-year IRRs of 30% to 40% on a pretax basis. ","So to wrap up, I want to highlight our priorities and investment expectations for 2012 and beyond. First, we want to continue to invest in the business to generate profitable and enduring growth. Second, we want to continue to evaluate select M&A opportunities that will enhance the value proposition of our -- I'm sorry, will enhance the value of our proposition of Platform Equinix. And finally, we want to continue to execute on actions that will support our shareholders. ","So let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Thanks, Keith. Let me now shift gears and cover our go-forward strategy and outlook for 2012. For 2012, we have 5 strategic priorities to fuel the value proposition we offer customers, as shown on Slide 18. First, we will continue to proactively develop our ecosystems to drive customer value and improve business performance through more interconnection in our IBXs. Network choice facilitates competitive advantage; proximity to partners and suppliers improves performance; and cross-connects accelerate deployment and reduce cost for our customers. Each interconnection we add increases the value of our ecosystems to customers and, ultimately, enables Equinix to become the interconnection platform for many of the world's leading businesses. ","Second, we will continue to expand our global reach and scale in order to maintain our position as the leading global data center business in our market. Today, over 59% of our revenues come from customers deployed in multiple countries, which demonstrates the benefit of having the broadest and deepest coverage around the world. We will continue to look at expanding Platform Equinix to key new markets to accommodate the growth of our existing customers. ","Third, we will continue to execute our vertical go-to-market strategy for our sales force and expand our channel partnerships. In 2011, we completed our sales force expansion to improve our coverage and vertical orientation. This year, we will continue to refine our sales force deployment and evaluate additional partnerships to enable a choice in cloud brokering, private cloud and security services. ","Our partnership strategy will focus on high-growth segments and increase our addressable market by leveraging new distribution channels, while offering additional solutions to our customers. ","The fourth element is refining our capital allocation strategy. While our first priority is to invest cash in the business to capture the robust demand we are experiencing, we are also on a trajectory to generate positive adjusted free cash flow in 2013, which allows for shareholder-friendly actions as well. ","The fifth priority driving our next wave of profitable growth will be a continued focus on making Platform Equinix seamless and consistent across our entire IBX footprint. Investments in products, processes and systems to help our customers offer in a global basis will remain a top priority. At the end of the day, it's all about making Equinix easy to do business with in a consistent, intentional and differentiated way.  We firmly believe the solid execution on these strategic priorities will help create a business that very few companies, if any, will be able to replicate. ","Now let's move to Slide 19 for our 2012 guidance. For the first quarter of 2012, we expect revenues to be in the range of $443 million to $446 million, which includes absorbing $2 million of currency headwinds. Cash gross margins are expected to range between 66% and 67%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between $90 million and $95 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $200 million and $205 million. Capital expenditures are expected to range between $180 million and $200 million, including approximately $30 million of ongoing capital expenditures. ","For the full year of 2012, we are maintaining total revenue expectation at greater than $1.87 billion or greater than 16% growth on a year-over-year basis, which includes roughly $15 million of currency headwinds relative to guidance rates provided on our last call. Total year cash gross margins are expected to be 66%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between $370 million and $400 million. ","We are maintaining an expected adjusted EBITDA for the year to be greater than $850 million, which includes roughly $7 million of currency headwinds to the prior guidance rates. We are maintaining our total CapEx guidance for 2012 at a range of $700 million to $800 million, which includes $135 million of ongoing capital expenditures, including an additional $15 million allocated to the development of our global IT system. We are investing in our business at a very attractive risk-return profile, and we continue to achieve our targeted returns. ","For 2012, we expect 65% of expansion capital expenditures will be for incremental phases on our campus builds, 30% for new sites and established markets and 5% for new market development. Campus builds are very attractive because they leverage existing cost infrastructure and network density. Decisions to build new sites in existing markets are based on visibility into current customer demand, competitive intelligence and ecosystem development, among other factors. For all IBX builds, Equinix's existing customer fill-rate analysis gives us strong visibility into a market demand, pricing and returns. ","So in closing, I believe we are living through a technology evolution that occurs only once in every 10 to 20 years. And we are uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities created by the growth of the digital economy. I'm very proud of what our team has accomplished in 2011, and we will continue to deliver exceptional value to our customers and shareholders. As the great Internet buildup continues, we will execute our strategy with discipline in 2012 and beyond to deliver both predictable and consistent results. ","So let me stop here, Matt, and I'll turn it back over to you for some Q&A. Matt, over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gray Powell.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just had a couple of quick ones. I'd like to make sure that I understand your CapEx budget correctly. On the last call, you said you had about $500 million in CapEx that included announced projects and ongoing CapEx. And that left about a $200 million to $300 million cushion in guidance. Today, you announced, I think, 5,200 cabinets by Q1 of 2013. So can you just update us on where that leaves the cushion, and just roughly speaking I was estimating these expansions will cost about $200 million, so can you tell me if I'm in the ballpark there?","Keith D. Taylor","Gray, I mean, ultimately, you're absolutely right. What we have now done is start to identify the projects we're embedded in, in that cushion. And so our DC11 site and the expansion into DC10 is an example of our Sydney and Singapore. So we fully intend to spend somewhere between $700 million and $800 million this year, and it is fair to say that you should probably shoot for the midpoint of that right now, and then we'll update you as the year progresses. But we fully intend to spend that ","capital.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then a second question, if I may. I mean the North American MRR saw that, that sequential increase since, I believe, Q2 of 2010. Can you just give us any insight on the pricing environment in the U.S. or has there been any benefit to the retail co-location pricing due to larger telco deals in 2011?","Charles Meyers","Yes, sure. Gray, this is Charles Meyers. Yes, we continue to see a very firm pricing environment, and I think the key to that is continuing to target the value where our segments of our customers really are achieving significant value out of using Platform Equinix. So we've seen very strong progress on our global platform deal, not only in the North America market but exporting business to our other regions as well. So we continue to see a very healthy pricing environment. As we noted and have noted in the past, our sweet spot really is in the sort of mid-sized deals for either network nodes or service aggregation nodes. And consistent with Steve's commentary on the multi-tiered architecture, our focus on the first 2 tiers of that architecture really allow us to deliver superior value, and correspondingly, get better price realization.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Larsen.","Christopher M. Larsen - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I wonder if you could just talk a little bit -- you alluded to the ability, Keith, of levering up the balance sheet, and I guess you've been fairly successful and quite successful, particularly with the ALOG expansion. If you could talk a little bit about other geographies that you might be looking at in terms of getting into. And I have a follow-up after that.","Stephen M. Smith","Let me start, Chris. I think consistent with what we've said in the past, we're very interested in the core, as we referred to in the past, BRIC countries. And as you all are aware, we made a play into Brazil. We're most interested probably in next priorities in China and India, and we have activity in both of those parts of the region, business development-type activity looking for the right opportunity. Our customer demand is very high in both of those parts of the world. I'd say that the fourth element of the BRIC countries is less priority today. And then there's a couple of tier 2 markets that are -- Keith and I have teams looking at. I think I have mentioned in Japan after the difficult times they had, a lot of data center companies in Tokyo are starting to look in Osaka for future builds. So we have a team looking in Osaka also. So we're investigating in that market. And then Australia, we've taken a look at the Melbourne market outside of the Sydney market. So those are the priority areas for the company.","Keith D. Taylor","And so, Chris, what else it does as you sort of start to think about cash that could be deployed tax for that, you think about the capital expenditures, and also sort of attached to that the shareholder-friendly action that we have taken and intend to continue to take. That actually will consume a lot of our cash that when we manage, basically, our net leverage, I think we should -- including liquidating some of the payables for our construction projects that sits on the balance sheet, we should get very close to the range, if not inside the bottom end of that range in 2012. And so it's something we'll continue to watch, as we sort of manage our capital plans and look at how we best take advantage of our capital structure.","Christopher M. Larsen - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Great. And then just as a follow-up. Steve, you said that some of the differences are -- I think, actually it was Keith, you said something about the differences in Europe, it had to do with timing. And then I just wanted to understand, is that the contract length, the time from initiation to closing is taking a little bit longer in Europe, or just the timing of when certain contracts close was the difference in the revenue performance in Europe?","Keith D. Taylor","Yes, it's more -- it was Americas, and it was more the installation interval that we talked about, so we have good booking activity across all 3 regions. And as you've seen in the past, and it's no different this quarter, sometimes you're going to see ebbs and flows in the amount of cabinets that install, in particular at the end of the quarter. And of course a factor of that is also churn, what happens in churn over a given period of time and whether it's a large installation, low pricing. And Charles alluded to it on the last call, there are certainly some cases where we see positive churn as attached to a number of cabinets. That could leave us an impact to basically our net cabinets add. So overall, I would tell you it's more just a natural outcome of how we booked, our booking activity this quarter, and you will continue to see it ebb and flow, and then how that installs over a period of time. So nothing that we are drawing any concern from.","Charles Meyers","But we certainly aren't seeing an increase in our install interval.","Christopher M. Larsen - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And the increase in install intervals, is that a customer demand?","Charles Meyers","No, clearly not -- we're not seeing it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Louthan.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just sort of follow-up on that. You've talked in the past like getting to sort of $3 billion run rate. Is that, again, will you need to get into China and India to get there? And then can you comment on sort of the margin trends going forward? How should we think about that, should continue to see some continued improvements there or relatively flat?","Keith D. Taylor","Number one point, really, to get to the target of $3 billion or thereabout in 2015, we don't have to do any M&A, if you will. Having said all of that, our intention would be that we would get -- we would invest in some additional markets over that time period. And then putting all that into perspective, as we think about sort of rolling out our plan towards what we call our long-term operating targets, we do expect margins to improve over time. As you know, we're investing very heavily, again, in 2012, both in expansion projects, we're investing heavily in our IT platform, as Steve alluded to, and we're going to continue to verticalize our sales organization. And when you take all that into consideration, we still -- we're still going to deliver, roughly, 46%-plus on EBITDA margin line in 2012. And so we're comfortable that margins will continue to creep up over time, as we could get to scale, and as we leverage off investments we've made over the last few years. And just sort of put that in perspective, as a company with targeted roughly 50% adjusted EBITDA margins. And that's something that we still have our sights set on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Rollins.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was wondering if you guys have explored the possibilities of converting part or all of your business into a REIT structure, and if you can give us an update in terms of how you're looking at that possibility.","Keith D. Taylor","Thanks for the question. We sort of expected that we're going to get that question from the field here. First and foremost, I think it's very important to note that my responsibility, one of my key responsibilities for 2012 is really to look at this, this possibility of turning or becoming a REIT over some period of time. We have to look at that very seriously in 2012. It's consistent with sort of our prior expectations that if you consume all of your NOLs in the 2013, 2014, or in some cases maybe even 2015 time frame, you have to really back up and figure out when do you start thinking about how to roll that out. So first and foremost, I'd tell you we are thinking about it very seriously. We're also thinking about other tax funding initiatives even as we walk and review this particular issue. And one we referred to not long ago with the Luxembourg HoldCo Structure that we're using for Europe. That all said, though, I think it's important I make a couple of comments. Number one, we're absolutely committed to shareholder return. And recognizing that, that there are some potential benefits attached, and I said potential benefits attached to the REIT, is something we have to look at very, very seriously. But also we are aware there are some structural issues, there are some considerations, and clearly there are some trade-offs. So taking all of that into consideration, we are going to put some energy towards this initiative this year, and will continue to update you on a quarterly basis as we progress through this serious and detailed review.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Keith, if I could follow up, 2 questions on that. The first part is, have you given some thought to what the AFFO number, what it looked like last year, for example, in the reported financials, or what the guidance would infer for this year? And then you mentioned about the commitment to shareholder returns. As you look at the buyback, the $100 million, or roughly $90 million or $100 million that you gave in 4Q, that was a significant step forward in the pace of the buyback relative to what the initial program was set at. So how do you look at buying back shares, is it just sort of smoothing it out over time to hit your commitment, you look at that more opportunistically depending on where the share price is? If you can give us a little flavor of how you look at distributing some of those returns to shareholders.","Keith D. Taylor","Sure. Well, I think to address the first question on AFFO. I think a great surrogate for us is really discretionary free cash flow, and we presented that in our slides today, and certainly it's $9-plus when you look at fiscal year '11. If you look at the last quarter, it's roughly $3 AFFO -- I'm sorry, discretionary free cash flow per share. And as we look forward, we expect to see that grow. And we said we can see it grow upwards of $11, $10 to $11 next year, being 2012. So it's really a number that is sizable and we would expect that it will continue to grow with the success for our business. In many ways it's going to grow with the EBITDA line. The EBITDA is such a great cash surrogate for us from an operating cash flow perspective. When we get into sort of shareholder value topics such as the share repurchase, we saw an opportunity, quite frankly, in Q4. As you know, we announced in mid to late November the approval of the program as supported by our Board. And we went through a very volatile time, and we took that as an opportunity to acquire where we could meaningful amounts of our stock, roughly 870,000 shares. And that sort of takes our sort of year-end sort of stock number down to about 46.7 million shares outstanding. As we look forward, we're going to look at what is the best and highest use of our cash. And certainly, we have the approval to acquire us shares, up to $250 million worth of share repurchase. So we're going to look at the opportunities that present themselves. And as we look forward in time, we will focus on the best and highest use of our cash recognizing that our overall objective as a company, both as I said and as Steve alluded to in his comments, is to drive our shareholder value. And our commitment is to the shareholder. We've also attached it, as you know, to our compensation plan for 2012. So we see that as another way to indicate to the shareholders, we are going to very much focus on value-creation for the shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Barden.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If I could just ask 2 related questions. One, Keith, on the guidance. I seem to ask this one quite a bit. But if I'm annualizing the fourth quarter EBITDA, obviously you guys have raised EBITDA guidance adjusting for currencies to 857 or better. But even if I look at the annualized fourth quarter and that 857 number, what it suggests is that EBITDA is going to grow sequentially every quarter around $7 million. Now that's obviously roughly 2\/3 of how faster we're growing in most of 2011, even normalizing for ALOG and onetime items. And then, we have got the entire cost structure of a larger sales force already embedded in the fourth quarter number. And presumably having a 60% larger sales force is going to give us some tailwinds at the top line and then to profitability for the rest of '12. So can you kind of walk us through how this much larger sales force, with the cost structure already embedded in, is going to lead to slower sequential EBITDA growth in '12 than we saw in '11?","Keith D. Taylor","Good. Great question, David. So why don't I take the first part, and then I'm going to pass it to Steve. Certainly when we look at the guidance we've offered both in Q1 and for 2012, we have considered, of course, our exit rates, our run rates and all that. I think it's important to note, number one, when you look into 2012, it's very early in the new year. And because it's early in the new year, we're taking position, we're just going to continue with the greater than story that we've done in the past. It works very well for 2011, and we would expect that to hold true for 2012 as well. That all said, as Steve mentioned, we're absorbing $15 million of FX headwinds. Because of that, we are basically from where we were last quarter to where we are today, the same number, the same results of the local level is greater than $1.885 million. So we are stepping it up. And then as we look at the quarter-over-quarter stuff, again, it's just very early the year. We're coming off a good strong quarter. We want to make sure that we continue to deliver. There's a lot of expectations that have been set for the team. That, in addition to the fact we're absorbing not only some capital cost that Steve alluded to for our high-key program, on the flip side there is a fairly meaningful number of operating expenses that will be attached to that same project. And that number is going to be, roughly, another $10 million-plus. And so when you look at that discrete project and what we're committing plus the FX currency, we feel at this stage of the game we've given you good -- we've given you a fair guidance. Now recognizing, we're only about 9 weeks away from updating our guidance because we will do that on the first quarter call. But right now, we feel very good about the numbers we've delivered. And as we did in 2011 and we have the same expectation for 2012, that we're going to continue to execute well and prove that we can deliver a strong operating performance for the business.","Stephen M. Smith","And David, I'd add a couple other comments just to color sales productivity a little bit because I think it's a very good question with the investment we've made. As you heard in our script, and I think Charles mentioned, we are very, very disciplined in how we're growing the type of customers we're bringing into these IBXs. So we are focused on value propositions and value aware customers. We're deadly focus on ecosystems and interconnection. So the sweet spot of the deals that we're pushing and approving are in this 10 to 30, 40 cabinet-type size, that these first 2 tiers of the architecture that I described today. So we fully expect to get higher-quality bookings, and that will drive firm to stable pricing that we're seeing. And that's where we're focused. And that's what we've asked the sales leadership to drive towards. So from a sales productivity standpoint, we're very happy with where we are. We're completing the verticalization of the sales force around our 5 go-to-market industry verticals. And we're seeing the bookings come in the way we want it. The pipeline is very strong. We're seeing, as we mentioned today, very good strength in network and financial. It's a little bit slower in the enterprise, and we knew that because the enterprise was made up of several other big industry verticals. And so we're learning where to go penetrate there. We're seeing success in a couple of segments, but there's more work to be done there. We have our global account teams all set up across major global networks, big global platform players and our key financial global folks. So we're making -- we're going higher and deeper in the big global accounts. The channel partnerships are starting to step up. We've announced 3 publicly, there'll be more to come as the year unfolds. We have our compliance go-to-market relationship with the company called Carpathia in the government circles and some enterprise customers. We're going to market with Amazon with the AWS Direct Connect. And we're also going to market with Rackspace with the OpenStack and cloud builder offer. So there's quite a bit going on there. Our sales engine is selling the global footprint, so whatever market the salespeople are in, they're selling the global footprint, which is working very good. So productivity, net-net, is up into the right, and it's ramping at the pace that we thought it would, but we're very focused on this, on a certain-sized deals. And as Keith and I said many times to the whole audience, we could grow this company a heck of a lot faster than we are today, but we're aiming this thing at ecosystem, higher-quality bookings, very disciplined in the type of deals that we're allowing into the IBXs. And that's where -- that's where the focus is. So we are achieving the balance we want with the type of bookings.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great color. Super appreciate it. One last housekeeping item, if I could quickly, Keith. I think you said that there was a onetime expense out in Asia that impacted comps there. Could you elaborate?","Keith D. Taylor","There's actually -- unfortunately wasn't just a one-off. There are certainly, there are some one-offs, but there is a higher repairs and maintenance that we brought into the quarter into Q4. There was some incremental power cost, and that's why you see the cash gross margin line down a little bit, partly due to settlement agreement that we had with one of the providers there. And then there's just some discrete accruals that we made in the market in that region. Again, it gets impacted a little bit more by the size of the region relative to the other 2 regions. But overall, we expect them to get back to their traditional EBITDA trends, that region I'm referring to.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sterling Auty.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two questions. Just elaborating, Steve, on the move with the cloud, you talk about going market with Amazon and Racks. How much of that movement in the cloud into data centers is going to come through that public cloud through vendors like that versus private cloud initiatives where you may see companies coming directly to implement their own private cloud directly in Equinix facilities?","Stephen M. Smith","Let me just -- we're obviously looking at all of the above. And our cloud business this past year grew to roughly 24% of our revenue for the company, so it's been very high growth for us. And we're seeing private cloud, public cloud, I mentioned we have 300-plus pure-play cloud providers that are operating in our IBXs and re-selling out to the world. There's another 500 IT service, managed service hosting companies that are offering cloud access. So we have a lot of activity going on here. The Direct Connect example you point to is just one example of a alternative method for CIOs to get a higher secure, avoid the Internet-type connection inside of our IBXs. And there are several other players that are also -- that we're talking today about Direct Connect activity. But I don't know if Charles or Jarrett, you have anything to add what you're seeing...","Charles Meyers","No, I don't know that I'll be able to put my finger on a specific breakdown in between the public and private. In fact, what we're seeing is that the people are very much going to this hybrid infrastructure which we talked about in the script, which is interconnecting the public cloud services for particular loads that are well served by that.  I mean, particularly, those that are highly variable. But over time, as they fill up VMs, it really make sense oftentimes for them to move that into OEM infrastructure. And then they're also extending that into private cloud to access cloud-based services of various sorts. So this sort of evolution towards hybrid cloud infrastructure is aggressively happening. And again, I think serves us, it really serves as well as an enabler, fundamental enabler of cloud computing.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And the follow-up, Steve, you mentioned a service aggregation point, I think in Europe with AMS3 that you're landing one of those as super pops. Do you, at this point, have some early visibility on the type of customer that wants to get into that aggregation point? Will it be a consistent contract, meaning will the type of customer and the type of contract that you have for that type of arrangement be similar to what you typically have, or is it going to be anything special about that deployment in particular?","Jarrett Appleby","Yes, this is Jarrett. It's a good question. I think really what you're going to see is, first of all, it started with the content players who are really leveraging the AWS infrastructure. But it is our typical business. They come in to take advantage of public Internet access and then Direct Connect. What's happening now is enterprises are using private networks, particularly Ethernet access into the cloud. So what you'll see is, we're seeing this evolution and it's exactly -- it started with public cloud infrastructure using our Internet exchanges. It then leveraged our Direct Connect offerings, which we're doing in multiple markets around the world. We're seeing natural cloud hubs form in about 12 to 15 markets, and that's growing. And then you're seeing an evolution to private networking, and particularly Ethernet, and that's why we've been talking about Ethernet the last year, that still allow you to directly connect from outside the data centers from an enterprise standpoint. And that opens up the market to the cloud-enabled enterprise as we call it, that community.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Horan.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Keith, is there -- there's some debate out there whether or not you can even become a REIT. I guess, in your mind, is there any debate, and what do you think would be the biggest structural hurdle to that? I just had a big quick follow-up in operating expenses, too.","Keith D. Taylor","Yes. Well, Tim, I think there's always a debate on what are the pros and cons. And clearly we, as a company, are going, as we've said, focus on driving as much shareholder value, irrespective of whether or not we can become a REIT or not, a lot of work to do. The complexity, typically, will revolve around the amount of interconnection services that we provide as a company. And obviously, you've seen with our announcements today the success that we're having in that particular revenue line. And then the other piece, of course, is in the international. And you've got to take all of that into consideration as you develop what one refers to as a taxable REIT subsidiary. So the company's highly focused on it. I think like anything, you got to review it. You've got understand it and appreciate not only the sort of benefits but also the complexity and then just make a decision. But I made a personal commitment to Steve that someday we're going to engage in very thoroughly in 2012, and we're already actually working at looking at the analyses. And we'll continue to update you, and that's the best we can offer right now.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just on the operating expenses. Any more color on utility expense declines in the quarter, and is this an ongoing trend, and what enable that?","Keith D. Taylor","Again, utilities, typical -- it's what you typically see in Q4 relative to Q3, there are some seasonal impact that comes out of -- particularly in the North American region when you look from Q3 to Q4. So that will be one thing that you tend to pay higher price points per unit in the Americas in the Q3. And then you, of course, you've got the step-down in Q4. So that has, unfortunately, a natural way of representing itself in our financials. And also this quarter we did get the benefit of some utility rebates based on the programs that we have entered into with our local providers. But overall, I would tell you that utility as a sort of a percent -- utility cost, pardon me, as a percent of our revenues, should always -- it's going to ebb and flow. It's typically been in the range of 12% to 14% of our revenue line. And we're going to continue to look at it from that perspective. But the one other comment I would make is that we are making investments, and part of the reason why you saw our ongoing CapEx go up in 2011 is the fact that we're making investments in the data center that will, hopefully, drive greater efficiency into the data center or the IBX. And over time that will enhance our ability to deliver higher returns.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colby Synesael.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions. First off, on the CapEx. If we look at the first quarter guidance, and it was obviously rounded up to the course of the year. It would imply that you're looking for a somewhat linear CapEx over the course of the year. Is that the case or do you think it could be more front-end loaded, in other words potentially a big jump in the second quarter and then maybe kind of tails off by the time we get to the fourth quarter? And then the other question had to do with the partners in that strategy, you talked about how you're focused more on that this year and you mentioned Carpathia, AWS and Rackspace as examples that you've recently signed. Is there going to be a revenue opportunity at some point for you? In other words, will there ever be a point that when you look at it strategically, where you could actually be reselling their services, and actually there might be some type of revenue-share opportunity? Or is this really just to sell more of your co-location services?","Keith D. Taylor","Good question. I'm going to take the first one, Colby, and then I'm going to pass it off. I think when you look at CapEx, it looks like it's going to be ratable at least by the guidance we've given you. That's probably not going to be the case. I think it's going to be generally more front-end loaded, all else being equal. Something that we'll continue to update you on, on a quarterly basis. But we would expect, certainly, the first 3 quarters of the year to take the majority of the burden. And so because of that, I would say that your -- the last quarter of the year is probably going to be the least significant from a CapEx perspective. But we're obviously looking -- we measure CapEx now, as you know, on a cash basis, and we're going to continue to review it and make sure we're sort of -- we're planning it well, so we can guide you as effectively as we can. And right now, I tell you, the first quarter is more, it's numerical coincidence that it adds a quarter of our total year's guidance.","Jarrett Appleby","And Colby, this is Jarrett again. I think, really, what we're seeing is an opportunity, one, we've identified a group of partners that really helped the value from platform-enabled services, particularly for the enterprise. A lot of the enterprise want bundled solutions. And we have identified a group of partners with the sales organization to go target, particularly around private, public cloud offerings, a cloud brokering capability, a cloud management capability and a security. So think of them as platform enabled services that are part of our portfolio that we can sell. And we get our traditional cabinets and interconnection business, are also able to start monetizing with them, they're incenting us to sell those kinds of solutions as well. So it is an enhancement of our value prop and a total solution that we're now positioning to the enterprises to make it easier to buy Platform Equinix.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","All right. But you don't envision a point where you're training yourselves for as to actually sell some of those cloud-hosting services?","Jarrett Appleby","We actually kicked off at our sales kickoff to educate them and position, not re-sell but sell side by side, more sell with a partner.","Operator","Our final question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. Just one housekeeping item and then maybe if we could dive into some more strategic stuff. Keith, could you tell us where the RP basket stood at the end of the year?","Keith D. Taylor","Yes, it's going to be -- it's just slightly up above over what we announced in the last quarter. So last quarter was roughly $191 million, so by now we're estimating it's just in and around the $200 million range, Jonathan. Again, it's roughly 50% of the C&I plus the equity, so it will be between $200 million and $210 million at the end of the year, roughly in that range, and that's what we're estimating.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","All right. I was wondering if we could talk about DC10. You have talked a lot about delivering hybrid architectures, addressing what really is a growing opportunity to match up dedicated and shared infrastructure. DC10, you've announced one customer win, and today, you talked a bit about investing a little bit more into that facility. I was wondering if you can spend, or maybe Charles could spend a little time telling us what's going on down there and what you're seeing, and maybe a little bit more color.","Charles Meyers","Thanks, Jonathan, this is Charles. So yes, we are delivering Phase 1 of DC10 this quarter. We've already presold several deals into that facility, and we're seeing a very strong funnel. So strong, in fact, that as you know, that we already announced -- approved and announced today our Phase 2 build. And I think, overall, what we're seeing is the customer response there really strongly validates our hypothesis behind that investment. And we're seeing strong demand from these customers with the multi-tiered architecture requirement, and customers who really want to maintain a comprehensive relationship with an infrastructure partner like us. And so again, it's not for everybody. I think it's a compliment to what we deliver for our ecosystem-focused customers. And again, those that have that kind of multi-tiered architecture requirement and want the premium service delivery that Equinix provides, it's a great fit for them. We're seeing real strong momentum in the market.","Katrina Rymill","That concludes our Q4 call. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

We encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information.","With us today are Steve Smith, Equinix's CEO and President; Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Meyers, President of the Americas. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in an hour, we would like to ask analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report Equinix delivered strong business and financial results in the fourth quarter, and another year of solid revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for 2012.","As depicted on Slide 3, revenue grew 21% to $1.896 billion for the year and adjusted EBITDA increased 24% to $896 million. The overall health of our business remains strong, with solid performance across all industry verticals. Deal size and pricing remain positive as we are winning the right mix of applications and customers in our IBXs. Despite uncertain economic conditions around the globe, we continue to experience strong sales momentum in bookings.","Turning to Slide 4, I'd like to highlight how we invested in the business in 2012. We generated approximately $705 million in cash from operations for the year and reinvested $608 million in 21 global IBX expansions with consistently high levels of returns. We now have over 7 million gross square feet of space, which is the largest retail data center footprint in the world. Ongoing CapEx was $157 million for the year, which included success-based installations, maintenance and value-enhancing initiatives such as our IBX optimization efforts and global IT initiative. Other successes for the year include record bookings achievement, increasing interconnection revenue by 21% and expanding the platform into 3 new markets, including Mainland China, Dubai and Jakarta.","We won important new customers and expansions in 2012 including business from Amazon Web Services, BATS trading, cable and wireless, Chicago Board of Options Exchange, Deutsche Telekom, Netflix, [indiscernible] and XO Communications.","Finally, we announced that we plan to pursue conversion to a real estate investment trust to enhance shareholder value while delivering profitable strategic growth. We finished the year having been added to the Nasdaq 100 index, and we are honored to be included alongside many of the world's most successful and dynamic technology companies.","Equinix remains at the heart of multiple industry trends, including the growth of mobility, IP traffic, Big Data, consumer-driven content and electronic trading, all driving demand for data center services. Integrating cloud services remains a priority for CIOs. Customers are shifting from monolithic infrastructure deployments to application-specific deployments that combine the benefits of traditional colocation with hybrid cloud capabilities.","Turning to Slide 5, we are winning hybrid cloud deployments as companies capture the benefits of building private cloud alongside direct connectivity to public cloud infrastructure inside of Equinix. Let me highlight 2 customer examples. First, Badgeville, a company that provides technology to improve user engagement on websites, delivers a Platform-as-a-Service that was initially built entirely on the public cloud. Over time, the growth of their user base drove a need for better performance and more control over their critical assets while managing their cost. Using Equinix, Badgeville deployed a hybrid cloud infrastructure building their database at Equinix and then leveraging Equinix's Direct Connect offering to access Amazon Web Services. This change resulted in a 40% reduction in Badgeville's monthly operational costs for cloud services, while increasing their application performance by 15% due to millisecond latency between the company's database and the public cloud nodes.","A second customer, Box, which is one of the leading content-sharing platforms, was looking to expand their data center footprint. Leveraging our sophisticated network performance tools, the Equinix sales team demonstrated that Box could significantly reduce latency for their service by deploying into multiple specific locations across our global platform. As a result, Box deployed infrastructure inside Equinix closer to their customers and improved customer application response times by 60%. Given the competitive differentiation that this type of application performance created for Box, their deployment with Equinix has grown from 2 cages in Silicon Valley to 7 IBXs across 3 regions.","Another focus in 2012 was expanding Platform Equinix into new markets. Our ability to expand into new markets is a critical differentiator as we help our customers deploy their IT infrastructure to meet their global needs. Our expansion strategy starts with our customers. We survey them biannually for which markets they are targeting and then identify and structure the right entry into those locations. In 2012, we became the first global data center operator with a presence in Shanghai. Our pipeline in Asia remains strong and, next month, we plan to open the second phase of Shanghai 5.","We also secured a strategic partnership with China Telecom, the largest carrier operating in Shanghai, to expand their service to our data centers. This partnership guarantees the availability of network resources and enables both companies to explore opportunities with multinational corporations. Dubai is also a strategic market for Equinix in the Middle East and is an important cable landing point between Europe and Asia. Currently, a majority of the IP traffic in the Middle East is backhauled to Europe or Asia to be exchanged, leaving to high latency and excessive bandwidth costs. We entered Dubai in November by acquiring a new data center that is now operational. We also partnered with Du, one of the 2 local carriers in the United Arab Emirates, to create the first pairing hub in the Middle East region. Du will offer reduced rate transit for customers who use the data center as a regional hub. Equinix is creating a unique offering in opening up opportunities for global businesses operating in the Middle East.  We are already experiencing interest from carriers, TDMs and content providers looking to reduce IP transit costs by pairing regional traffic in Dubai.","And finally, I'll give a quick update on our planned conversion to a real estate investment trust. Consistent with what we've said previously, we filed a request for a Private Letter Ruling with the IRS at the end of last year. Assuming we are successful in the conversion process, we plan to elect REIT status beginning January 1, 2015. As a reminder, the timing of the REIT conversion is primarily driven by the operational complexities and risk trade-offs of our global system and process work and the associated dependencies to report as a REIT. As appropriate, we will continue to update the market on our earnings calls regarding our progress.","So let me stop here, and turn it over to Keith to review the financials for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'm pleased to provide you with additional detail on the fourth quarter and the full year of 2012.","With the exception of the consolidated financial results, the majority of the other key non-financial metrics will exclude the impact of ALOG, ancotel and Asia Tone as we continue to integrate these acquisitions and their service offerings into our systems and our metrics.","So starting with Slide 6 today, from our presentation posted, core Q4 revenues from continuing operations was $507 million, a 4% quarter-over-quarter increase and up 20% over the same quarter last year, including a $2.3 million nonrecurring benefit in the quarter. This is the first quarter we've delivered half a billion dollars of revenue or more, underscoring the scale and reach of our business. Asia Tone and ancotel contributed $18.4 million to the quarter, up 14% quarter-over-quarter increase. Also ALOG continues to perform well, contributing $19.4 million of revenue in the quarter whereas 7% quarter-over-quarter increase after adjusting for the weakening Brazilian real.","Our Q4 revenue performance reflects a $3 million positive currency benefit when compared to the average rates used in Q3 and a $900,000 negative impact when compared to the FX guidance rates. For the year, our revenues from continuing operations were $1.896 billion, a 21% increase over the prior year.","Global cash gross profit for the quarter was $348 million, a 5% increase over the prior quarter and up 23% over the same quarter last year. Cash gross margins were 69%, higher than originally anticipated due to stronger than planned revenues and lower than expected utility expenses and other variable costs.","Global cash SG&A expenses were $108 million for the quarter, a 6% increase over the prior quarter yet below our expectations due to lower professional and consulting fees and a smaller than expected advertising and promotion spend. Cash SG&A expenses increased by 21% over the same quarter last year.","Global adjusted EBITDA was $239 million for the quarter, up 5% increase over the prior quarter and a 24% increase over the same quarter last year, including $3.5 million of nonrecurring benefits primarily attributed to revenues and utility costs. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance reflects the $1 million positive currency effect when compared to the average ratios in Q3 and a $500,000 negative impact when compared to our guidance rates. Adjusted EBITDA growth reflects our increased revenue performance, better-than-expected cap gross margins and lower than planned SG&A spending.","Global income from continuing operations increased $102 million, a 6% increase over the prior quarter and up 24% over the same quarter last year. Despite the recognition of Q4 impairment charges related to the write-down of assets in Los Angeles and Sydney and acquisition costs related to the purchase of the Dubai IBX and our venture in the Indonesian market.","Global net income attributable to Equinix was $45 million for the quarter, a meaningful increase over the prior quarter, largely due to strong operating performance and the after tax gain on the sale of the 16 IBX assets.","Our fully diluted earnings per share was $0.88 or $0.66 from continuing operations, a significant increase over the same quarter last year.","Now let me turn to global MRR churn. Our MRR churn was 3% for the quarter, consistent with our expectations. We expect churn to remain at or near these levels for the next few quarters reflecting our efforts to optimize our business mix and migrate key customers to sustainable and multi-tier architectures. Our 2013 guidance fully contemplates the MRR churn dynamics. Our operating discipline in managing IBX assets is critical to our long-term success and enables us to deliver stronger operating results in the form of pricing per cabinet, better operating margins and increased utilization of our IBX asset base. Over time, we expect our MRR churn to moderate downwards as we execute our strategy and focus on high-value applications.","Now I'd like to give you a brief update on REIT conversion costs. Please refer to Slide 7. Slide 7 summarizes the various expected REITs, cash costs and tax liabilities similar to our discussion last quarter. We continue to expect to incur $50 million to $80 million in cash cost to support the REIT conversion process over the next 2 years, which includes upgrading our global financial system and processes.","For 2012, we incurred approximately $3 million of REIT related cash costs. For 2013, we estimate that we'll incur $20 million in incremental SG&A cash spend and $5 million of additional capital expenditures for REIT conversion. In the first quarter, we expect to pay approximately $3 million in incremental cash cost related to the REIT program, which is reflected in our Q1 '13 guidance. Separately, we've modified downwards our 2013 tax liability and now range between $175 million and $250 million.","Turning to Slide 8, I'd like to start reviewing our regional results beginning with the Americas. Overall health of the Americas business remains strong. Americas revenues was $299 million, a 2% increase over the prior quarter and up 12% over the same quarter last year. Cash gross margins increased slightly to 72%, largely driven by strong disciplined growth and optimization initiatives across our asset base. Cross-border bookings across all regions continue to be strong and validate our global platform strategy. Adjusted EBITDA was $150 million, up 6% quarter-over-quarter and 17% over the same quarter last year, primarily due to lower utilities expense. Americas adjusted EBITDA margin was 50% for the quarter, a healthy improvement over the prior year despite the region absorbing the majority of the corporate overhead costs.","America net billings or net cabinets billing increased by approximately 1,400 in the quarter and reflects, in part, the conversion of our backlog to billable cabinets. America pricing remains firm, which supports our continued commitment to disciplined growth and an optimization strategy. Americas interconnection revenues represent 20% of the region's recurring revenues.","In Q4, we added over 800 net cross-connects, lower than prior quarter's, primarily as a result of grooming due to consolidation activity among select network service customers. From an inventory perspective, in Q4, we opened a second phase of our DC10 asset, adding capacity for our business suites offering, which targets customers with a multi-tier architectural requirement. Also, we opened 2 new IBXs in January: DC11, our 11th IBX on our flagship Ashburn campus; and Seattle 3, which will help us build out the Northwest market, a critical distribution point for IP traffic to Asia. And finally, today, we're announcing a new build in Toronto, a critical market for our customers in the financial services vertical, providing us inventory in this high-demand location.","Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 9. EMEA had a solid quarter against a negative economic backdrop across much of Europe. The U.K. continues to gain momentum, particularly in the financial services and network verticals. In Germany we've now linked our Alcatel assets to our other existing Frankfurt IBXs and this will allow our customers to leverage the network density of this enhanced footprint. In Paris we saw gross strong bookings activity with our newly opened Paris 4 IBX. Among our recent bookings were 2 new enterprise customers. The first phase of our Paris 4 IBX is now approximately 50% sold.","Turning to the quarter, revenues in EMEA was $117.5 million, up 5% sequentially and 19% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $45.5 million on adjusted EBITDA margin of 39% largely due to the expansion drag attributed to the number of IBXs opening in the latter half of 2012, higher seasonal utility costs and increased salary and benefit cost. Normalized and on a constant currency basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 13% compared to the same quarter last year. EMEA interconnection revenues remained at 7%, adding approximately 400 net cross-connects to the quarter. Net cabinets billing increased by approximately 1,100 the results of strong booking activity over the past quarter.","And now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to Slide 10, Asia Pacific had a strong sales momentum this quarter, driven by wins in cloud, digital media and content and financial verticals. Asia Pacific revenues were slightly under $90 million, up 8% sequentially including $2.1 million attributed to the nonrecurring revenue benefit, or up 30% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Overall pricing remains firm across our entire Asia Pacific footprint.","Adjusted EBITDA was $43 million, up 7% quarter-over-quarter or 43% on a normalized and constant currency basis over the same quarter last year. Consistent with our expectations, adjusted EBITDA margin was down slightly due to increased leasing costs and higher sales and marketing expenses in the quarter. Cabinet billings increased by approximately 200 over the prior quarter, less than initially expected due to the timing of customer installations. Interconnection revenues were 11% of the regions recurring revenues, slightly down from the prior quarter primarily due to customer installations in the quarter.","During the quarter we added approximately 600 net cross-connects with a positive shift towards fiber cross-connect as customers migrate to higher bandwidth consuming business practices. Our financial services vertical continues to grow rapidly across Asia Pacific, with particular strength in our Tokyo market. In Q4, we announced to build about 4 IBX in this market, strategically located in the heart of the business district to support the momentum of this developing financial ecosystem.","And now looking at some balance sheet data, please refer to Slide 11. Our current liquidity position remains healthy and we ended the year with $547 million of unrestricted cash and investments, an increase over the prior quarter primarily due to our strong operating performance and $77 million in proceeds from the sale of 16 IBXs to 365 Main and their partners. Consistent with the scale and growth of our business, our total assets have increased to greater than $6 billion this quarter.","Looking at the liability side of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with gross debt of $3 billion or net debt of $2.5 billion about 2.6x our Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA. In the short term, we'll continue to review our balance sheet and debt structure to assess opportunity to refinance with a clear objective of lowering our cost of borrowing by operating an improved and more flexible covenant structure as we move towards the REIT conversion.","And now looking at Slide 12, our Q4 operating cash flow increased to $209 million due to our strong operating performance, lower quarterly interest payment and improved working capital management over the quarter, 105% increase over the prior quarter and up 11% over the same quarter last year. Our adjusted discretionary free cash flow was $185 million in Q4 and $548 million for the year, after excluding the tax impact of equity awards on operating cash flows that was triggered by the REIT conversion. This equates to greater than $11 per basic share outstanding at year end. For 2013, we now expect our adjusted discretionary free cash flow, excluding REIT-related costs or taxes, to range between $620 million and $640 million.","Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to Slide 13. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $210 million consistent with our guidance. Ongoing capital expenditures were $43.5 million, which included less than $10 million in maintenance, efficiency enhancement or single points of failure capital. For the year, ongoing capital expenditures totaled $157 million. Additionally, we invested $25 million in real estate assets and $23 million for the acquisition of our Dubai IBX.","Now turning to Slide 14, the operating performance of our 24 North America IBX and expansion projects has been opened for more than 1 year and continue to perform well. Currently, these projects are 85% utilized in January at 35% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested. Our 8 oldest IBXs grew 7% year-over-year as customers continue to purchase additional power and cross-connects, as well as space as it becomes available through our optimization initiatives.","So let me turn the call back to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Thanks, Keith. Let me now shift gears and cover our go forward strategy and outlook for 2013 on Slide 15. We will continue to execute on our 5 strategic priorities designed to further differentiate our global offering of network IBXs, and we do have the unique ability to help inefficient markets become more productive with Platform Equinix.","First, we'll continue to proactively develop our ecosystems to drive customer value and improve business performance through more interconnection in our IBXs. We will further solidify our leadership in the network and financial ecosystems and accelerate momentum in our emerging ecosystems. The customers find unique value in connecting to their customers and partners in our IBXs as evidenced by cross-connects between customers growing at 2x the rate of connections to network service providers. For example, financial to financial cross-connects grew 35% year-over-year showing a scale of this ecosystem. We are also targeting new ecosystems where Equinix can uniquely differentiate its offerings such as e-commerce, over-the-counter trading exchanges, digital advertising exchanges, network performance hubs for enterprise WANs, as well as cloud access nodes and Direct Connect capability to enable the hybrid cloud.","Second element of our strategy is to expand the global reach and scale of Platform Equinix both organically and through acquisitions. In the Americas, we will leverage our market leadership to drive more interconnection in core markets. In Europe, our focus will be to deepen our penetration of critical ecosystems. And in Asia, we will expand our footprint into emerging and adjacent markets in order to gain market share.  Our global platform is a unique differentiator for Equinix. We offer services in 31 cities across 5 continents, more than any other data center provider. Customers value our ability to make global expansion easy by managing deployments with a single supplier. Today, over 60% of recurring revenues comes from customers deployed across multiple regions, up from 55% just 3 years ago. The number of customers deployed with Equinix in all 3 regions grew 32% year-over-year. Going forward we will continue to expand with the disciplined approach as we evaluate new markets and opportunities.","Third, we will continue to execute on our vertical industry go-to-market strategy, which has been a key factor in expanding our customer base and maintaining stability in market pricing. Equinix is investing and deepening the industry expertise of our sales teams, organizing teams around targeted verticals and adding solution architects who can help customers solve for complex requirements. These enhancements help customers reduce time-to-market and significantly improve their return on capital. Equinix is also expanding its partnerships to help provide more holistic solutions that leverage the unique value of Platform Equinix to optimize application performance, deploy cloud services and leverage network density and global reach. Our vertically aligned go-to-market strategy continues to pay off as we extend our market leadership in our more mature verticals and see strong signs of momentum in the emerging areas.","The fourth element is refining our capital allocation strategy. This year, we expect to generate approximately $175 million of adjusted free cash flow, excluding REIT-related cash costs and tax liabilities. This is a significant inflection point for the company generating a meaningful level of adjusted free cash flow, while funding our growth. We will continue to assess our funding needs going forward and we'll consider the issuance of debt and\/or equity to support business growth and capital needs. Our priorities for the deployment of capital will remain focused on driving top line growth through both organic and inorganic investments with a balance view towards profitability. Equally, we'll remain focused on generating free cash flow, thereby ensuring that we have sufficient funding to meet our requirements under the REIT structure including distributions to shareholders.","The fifth priority is to improve our global customers' experience through investments in products, processes and systems. Operating as a global company requires global product offerings; simplify the streamline business processes including quoting, fulfillment and billing; and consistency in all of our customer interactions. These investments will help us delight our customers and will enable us to scale our business, drive operational efficiencies and hit our long-term operating targets. We firmly believe that solid execution on these strategic priorities is creating a business that is uniquely positioned and highly valuable to customers and shareholders.","And finally, I'd like to provide an update on 2013 guidance summarized on Slide 16. For the first quarter of 2013, we expect revenues to be in the range of $518 million to $522 million. Cash gross margins are expected to range between 68% and 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between $116 million and $120 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $236 million and $240 million. Capital expenditures are expected to range between $140 million and $160 million, including approximately $40 million of ongoing capital expenditures. For the full year of 2013, we are maintaining total revenue expectation at greater than $2.2 billion or greater than 16% growth on a year-over-year basis, which absorbs roughly $2 million of currency headwinds relative to guidance rates provided on our last call. Total year cash gross margins are expected to be between 68% and 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between $490 million and $510 million.","We are maintaining expected adjusted EBITDA for the year to be greater than $1.01 billion, which absorbs approximately $3 million in net costs attributed to our Dubai acquisition. This also includes $20 million in REIT conversion costs effectively and adjusted EBITDA margin of 47% before REIT costs. We are maintaining our total CapEx guidance for 2013 at a range of $550 million to $650 million, which includes $165 million of ongoing capital expenditures. We are investing in our business at a very attractive risk return profile, and we continue to achieve our targeted returns.","So in closing, the health of our business remains strong as we continue to execute on our 5 strategic priorities. We remain keenly focused on delivering compelling value to our customers, which supports the right mix of business in our IBX locations and, in turn, deliver superior returns on invested capital. We are also enhancing our operational discipline and refining our go-to-market model to maintain momentum and sales productivity across all of our operating regions. Equinix is benefiting from highly attractive secular trends and remains a central figure in the growth and evolution of key digital ecosystems. This ecosystem strategy, combined with our scale, network density, mission-critical reliability and global footprint continue to stimulate interconnection and drive solid business results.","So at this time, I'd like to open it up for questions and I'll turn it back over to you, Mitch.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Jonathan Schildkraut [Evercore Partners].","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Actually I'm trying to sneak 2 in here. Keith, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned a $2.3 million nonrecurring benefit. I was wondering if just if you could tell us what market that came in? And then separately, you gave some nice color commentary about bookings and I was wondering if you can kind of sum up the bookings activity for the quarter versus maybe what you had seen over the rest of the year or if it makes sense to talk about it seasonally versus other years. And as you drive bookings, a big part of that has been your scaling of the sales force and I'd love an update on the productivity that you're seeing in terms of the folks that you hired and I wonder if there are any additional plans to add to the headcount?","Keith D. Taylor","Great. So I'll take the first one, and Steve and Charles will take the second. The $2.3 million -- the $2.1 million of it relates to Asia Pacific and $200,000 is Europe, specifically, Singapore and Switzerland. And so those are one-off benefit that will not theoretically repeat itself, so we want to make sure we call that out.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And that was a revenue benefit or just cost benefit?","Keith D. Taylor","That was actually a revenue benefit. Top line benefit associated with certain customer contracts.","Stephen M. Smith","And on the second part of your question, Jonathan, let me give you some color and then Charles can probably add some points here. But first of all, I think, everybody on the call, it's probably good context to know that Q4, from a gross booking standpoint, was our second best quarter, historically. So a very good performance by the team by any measurement. And as we told you in past calls, we're closely tracking new rep productivity, as well as tenured rep productivity and I will tell you that it's continuing to move as we've described in the past up into the right with meaningful improvement actually in Q4 with our new rep productivity and Charles can probably give a little bit more color on that. And I would say the vertical orientation that I described is really starting to pay dividends for us because we're speaking in the customer's language. We understand their application needs. It's helping us to really determine the right mix of applications into the right assets. And just very quickly in the quarter from a booking standpoint, pretty similar history by vertical. We have roughly 23% of our bookings come in the network and cloud verticals on a global basis. About 21% of the bookings fell into the content digital media. Roughly 20% in financial and enterprise was the remainder, about 13%. So from a bookings in the quarter standpoint, pretty good spread and I would tell you, there's no big trends, Jonathan, on a regional basis by those verticals. We're seeing, because of the global platform focus, a pretty good mix across all industries. I don't know if you'd add anything there, Charles.","Charles Meyers","Yes. I will give a little more color, Jonathan, relative to the -- specifically, on the Americas. As Steve indicated, we have record bookings performance across many of our verticals and geos and really continue to see very strong demand for platform deals that are leveraging our presence in multiple regions. Q4 was a particularly strong contribution from our new rep cohort, which some of them have been on for as much as a year now, some shorter than that. But the overall contribution from that cohort has more than doubled than in the past several quarters and continues to trend up into the right. So Q4 was definitely a strong bookings quarter, a good solid continued momentum in the mature verticals and really some realtime momentum in some of the more emerging areas. As Steve said, we're seeing some significant benefits from the vertical alignment of the teams and in terms of our plans going forward, we probably will make some modest additions and some modest force redeployment actions in terms of just trying to put the forces where we can believe we'll get the most return from them in '13. But we'll probably make a few modest additions. I think the additions in the other regions will be slightly higher.","Stephen M. Smith","Yes.  Just to put a point on that, Jonathan, we're running at, call it, 207, 208, 209 quota-bearing heads around the world today by the end of the year based on pace and performance it might creep up to 235, 240 somewhere in that range. Call it the quota-bearing heads on a global basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Sterling Auty [JP Morgan Chase & Co.].","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to talk about the Asia Pacific region. You mentioned that the relationship with China Telecom -- is the focus still on companies looking for colocation where the data traffic's going in and out of China? Or does this relationship open up the opportunity to expand in Mainland China for companies where a lot of their data traffic going in and out of the data centers stays within Mainland China?","Stephen M. Smith","Well, the primary -- the business in Shanghai, to get started, can be a little different than in markets where you have multiple network density type of situation. So China Telecom is the predominant provider in southern China versus China Unicom in northern -- in the Beijing area and then, of course, you have China Mobile that's in the mix. So there's 3 big carriers in that market. And then the other international carriers, obviously, leverage wholesale basis those relationships. But our intent is to work with multinational companies that have either customers or employees in the Shanghai region, and they just need a high-quality data center provider to provide space. And we can do interconnections within that facility. But it's a little bit different mix than, say, 21 Vianet or some of the other local providers are doing from a license standpoint. So we will be primarily focused on high-quality data center space and interconnection within the 4 walls of that facility.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great, and then maybe one follow-up. We saw the Rackspace results last night and what they're doing in dedicated hosting in cloud. I'm wondering -- and the new customers coming in for colocation, is there any change in kind of the use cage, what they're looking to do, as well as maybe cage size and power requirement right off the back as we also talked about increased density a lot through 2012?","Charles Meyers","Sterling, this is Charles. I'll respond a little bit on that. I think that we are seeing a pretty significant uptick in terms of CIOs looking at hybrid cloud architectures as sort of their future. And so I think what that is resulting in is really our ability to act as that sort of cloud hub for them both to meet their traditional colocation requirements for things where they need the security and the control, and so that we still see an appetite for colo, but that's augmented by them using our interconnection to the public cloud players in a direct connect format and using our network density to censor and stitch together hybrid clouds. And I think what that means is that we are seeing, actually, some use of, what I would consider, cloud nodes that are sort of relatively smaller implementations but that are more interconnection dense. But we see -- we definitely see an appetite for them, for people accessing public cloud providers and using cloud-based SaaS applications to meet their needs and really leaning on Equinix as the place to do that from.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Frank [indiscernible].","Unknown Analyst","Can you talk to us a little bit -- I think you mentioned earlier and I apologize if I missed the details, some larger wholesalers may be moving down market. Any thoughts there? What sort of  steps are you taking there? And it seems like the enterprise side is picking up a bit as a percentage of the bookings, it sounds like, how is that trending and any thoughts on trying to drive higher penetration out of the enterprise area?","Charles Meyers","Sure, Frank, this is Charles, I'll pick up and then if Steve or Keith want to add anything... Again, I tend to view the competitive overlap with the wholesalers as very modest. There are, as we said on a number of occasions, occasionally we'll look at larger footprint opportunities that may, in fact, have wholesale as a viable alternative. But that tends to be the exception rather than the rule. And so we still continue to see ourselves on a relatively different supply curve and meeting different set of customer needs, generally, vis-\u00e0-vis the wholesale market. As it relates to the enterprise, I would say that I think we are relevant to a portion of the enterprise need, where application performance, network density and global reach really matter. Again, that's the sweet spot for Equinix. We are not going to chase large footprint, razor thin margin deals for back-office applications, et cetera. That's not what we're about. But what we are seeing is people who want to, for example, use our network density to optimize the performance of their WAN or if they're implementing SaaS based applications that need performance -- have certain performance requirements or want to interconnect to use public cloud via Direct Connect or SaaS-based applications with higher performance, they're looking at putting in relatively small but distributed application implementations across the Equinix footprint, and that's the sweet spot for us and really provides them with compelling value.","Stephen M. Smith","The only thing I'd add, Frank, this is Steve, is that the other dynamic you have going on in the market is the global telcos are all trying to service enterprise also. And so the way they're doing that is cloud-enabled activity. So our conversations with the telcos today are spreading their footprint deeper and wider inside of Equinix with access nodes and primary nodes, et cetera to help get to the enterprise. And so that will have a pull through effect to enterprises understanding that get to the networks inside of Equinix's data center. So there's lot of dynamics going on here in the enterprise.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Brett Feldman [Deutsche Bank].","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just to maybe clarify on some of the one-timers, I think you also mentioned some one-time benefits at the EBITDA level, did I hear that correctly?","Keith D. Taylor","Yes, Brett. So there's 2 -- the $3.5 million in total this quarter that we wanted to pull out, specifically, $2.3 million sitting on the top line and then $1.2 million sitting in the cost of revenue line that's specific to the Americas region. But the $2.3 million, as I said earlier on, $2.1 million relates to Singapore and $200,000 relates to Switzerland. And so that's the $3.5 million in one off benefit that we think is appropriate for you to pull out this quarter.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So then even if I make that adjustment, you still came in well ahead of the EBITDA guidance you had provided for the fourth quarter. It looks like SG&A in the Americas was a contributor there. I was hoping I'd just get a better understanding of what the spending pattern has been and then what's going to happen in the first quarter? Because you're kind of guiding towards more of a flattish EBITDA result.","Keith D. Taylor","Yes, as you know our model pretty well, our costs are predominantly fixed and are the same bucket of costs that we see quarter in and quarter out. And sort of when we look at the trendlines, we did a little bit better on the revenue line partly due to this one-off benefit, but we also did better on the cost of revenue line. When you look at the SG&A line, it's the standard discussion, it was salaries and benefits less advertising and promotion and lower than anticipated professional and consulting fees. We originally felt we spent a little bit more in the REIT workout coming through the quarter and some of that's getting pushed into the Q1 timeframe. So that sort of addresses sort of Q4, sort of really across-the-board. There's nothing really substantive that I've pulled out. And the only other thing I'd say is maybe a little bit lower in the salary line. We didn't hire quite as many people as we planned and that seems to be a trend that holds true. If you look then forward into Q1, there's a couple of things I wanted to make sure I highlighted. And so when you look at this quarter, we did just roughly $239 million of EBITDA. If you take out the $3.5 million of benefit, you're roughly at $235 million of EBITDA. Next quarter, so being Q1, we're going to -- we're guiding you -- we take you to the midpoint, which is 5 20. Net add is roughly $60 million. So your modified EBITDA should be in the range of 2 50. That would be the standard expectation for the Street. So the question is what's causing it to be relatively flat? Well consistent with all the prior years, given the employee benefits and sort of the employer costs associated with FICA and all the other added costs that are coming into the equation this quarter, we're going to actually increase our employee benefits and the employer portion of it in or around $5 million this quarter. In total, employee benefits are going up $9 million but embedded in that $9 million is $5 million. Salaries are going up $4 million and utilities are going up $5 million. And that's offset by roughly $5 million in net savings quarter-over-quarter. So overall, a lot of numbers there, but it really sort of tells you that quarter-over-quarter, it's the seasonal aspect primarily of employee benefits that are affecting the flow through that you're going to experience.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And your full year guidance incorporates all that as well?","Keith D. Taylor","Absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. David Barden [BofA Merrill Lynch].","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Keith, maybe just following up on that. Because I went back the last quarter, you were giving a midpoint of fourth quarter guidance that was below what you've produced for 4Q. If I had annualized that old guidance, your $1.01 billion EBITDA number implied about $100 million of year-over-year growth. If I annualize what you actually produced in the fourth quarter, it suggests that the 1 0 1 0 target is actually only about $60 million higher. So I guess based on what I heard Steve saying about sales force productivity and the second-best bookings ever in the fourth quarter, it seems to me like the 1 0 1 0 is increasingly in the rearview mirror from a 2013 outlook standpoint. Could you address more specifically why you didn't feel like you wanted to move that floor up because it seems to be getting less and less realistic? And then if I could just one more question. There seems to be, in the last couple of months, with your choice to become a REIT in 2015, we're using REIT valuations, we're using AFFO valuations. And there seems to be a debate about how the right way to calculate AFFO is for Equinix. Could you weigh in and just tell us what Keith thinks about that?","Keith D. Taylor","Okay, David. So in the end we did modify our guidance. We fully understand that. I think first and foremost, I'd like to talk a little bit about the revenue side. When you think about revenues and basing what we offered to the midpoint of guidance, so it's an $18 million net uplift quarter-over-quarter. So Q1 versus Q4, a net uplift of roughly $18 million. So I got to take out that 2 -- $2 million, $2.3 million one-off benefit. And so if you just take that and assume every quarter throughout this year we're going to add roughly $18 million, it gets you really to what we call our floor of roughly 2 -- $2.2 billion or greater. Certainly, expected inside the performance of the business is that we'll continue to produce more from a sales productive -- productivity perspective. Clearly, we're being muted today, sort of the last quarter, this quarter, by the churn that we're absorbing. But all that said, we certainly expect to, given the guidance we're delivering to you today, we expect that we'll continue to produce better. And in fact, we think that we'll deliver higher growth through the back end of the year versus the first half of the year. So that's sort of just talks a little bit about the revenue line. If I take to the cost line, there's a couple of things. Certainly, when we look at our annualization of our Q4 EBITDA, you got to take that $3.5 million benefit, which again it doesn't explain the whole difference, but you also have to recognize there's $20 million of REIT cost. The REIT cost that are coming into the equation. Not to mention the massive investment this company is making to move towards the REIT, not just from the discrete costs we're talking about, but the investment in our people, more in our systems, in our platforms, some of the other tax work that we're doing around the world. In the end, we're going to add more sales people. We're going to open up more IBXs. Obviously, these IBXs that we opened up last year was the greatest amount of expansion the company's ever done. We're now going to have to staff them and do all the things that you would expect. And because of that, it's sort of muting our overall performance. So in fact, if you look at the first half of the year, you say, okay, I can understand where we're going because of all of that. The theory behind the guidance that we're delivering today is an acceleration through the second half of the year. And that's where you get the benefit of all the things that we're doing as an organization. And hopefully recognizing we're going to give you updated guidance in roughly 8 weeks from now when we do our Q1 guidance. At that point in time, we certainly are going to take the opportunity to refine the guidance similar to what we did last year. But I'd just tell you right now, we feel it's appropriate to stick to what we give you off the Q3 earnings call, recognizing that we have been running a little bit better than we anticipated, but there is this expectation that we'll invest more in marketing, more in sales and, certainly, more in the back office to scale the business towards the $3 billion number or greater [indiscernible] in 2015 and then looking into 2016 and beyond.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And the AFFO question?","Keith D. Taylor","I was hoping you would forget that one, David. But Charles reminded me of it. AFFO, again, what we did this quarter, very much like we've done in the past. Adjusted discretionary free cash flow is a very good surrogate, we believe, for the AFFO. And as you saw what I said in my prepared remarks and as you see in the chart, it's north of $11 of AFFO per share. But the thing that we're working on is doing a much better job of trying to break down all of the CapEx because I think some of the confusion is not so much around how we get to the operating metrics. It's more about how do we allocate what capital into the theoretical AFFO calculation. To us, it's still a little bit early to do that, but we're eleven dollar four of -- $11.41 on sort of basic share count of $48 million of AFFO. The thing that we haven't really fully burdened is really where we're going to take it. But what I did give you this quarter was $10 million and what I consider to be true maintenance spend in our CapEx line and what maintenance CapEx. And that's the thing that sort of -- we want to make sure we get it all right. And so we'll be updating that probably as we come through 2013. We'll start to give you not, only a discretionary free cash flow number, but we'll start to think about the AFFO. But having said all of that, AFFO, our discretionary free cash flow, we saw a roughly 19% increase this year over last year. The guidance we have given you would suggest that we grow another 15%, 2013 over 2012. And right now I would ask you to continue to use discretionary free cash flow or what we call adjusted discretionary free cash flow as the metric that will be a good surrogate for AFFO.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Colby Synesael [Cowen and Company].","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Two, if I may. First one just wanted to talk about optimization projects in Europe and Asia. I know you initially focused on Americas, but seems like you're talking more about transitioning that to Europe and Asia. I was wondering if you could just talk about that in terms of how far along you are in the process when you compare that to where you are in America? And then also kind of tying back into that, I just wanted to get an update on churn. It seems like in some of your more recent public forums, you've actually talked about churn coming down in the back half of 2013. Curious if you're still expecting that. And then just briefly, was hoping you could talk about how the sales cycle has changed, if at all, in the European market over the last few months.","Stephen M. Smith","Colby, let me start and then Charles can pick up the churn conversation in the Americas. On a global basis, the work that Charles and his team started late -- well, I guess, late the year before, early last year, he did take that learning and poured it over to Asia and Europe. We have started to apply the same methodology, if you will, or frameworks, if you will, as we're renewing contracts. So we're putting the same lens on optimization around the world. It's just more -- it's a larger activity in the Americas. But as we renew and we look at that multi-tiered architectures and how customers are bifurcating the deployments, we're applying the same discipline around the world. And I would tell you it's early days in Europe and Asia for that. And I don't know, Charles, how you describe Americas, but we're well into it in the Americas.","Charles Meyers","Yes, we're certainly well advanced in our overall optimization efforts, which has a number of dimensions to it. And through the overall IBX optimization project, we've now sort of bridging to churn. We've got a very good handle on our book of business, and we evaluate our renewals with a very disciplined approach that considers a number of factors and, therefore, in any given quarter, churn can be volatile depending on where we land with certain renewals. But I can tell you that I'm very confident the decisions we're taking will allow us to moderate churn downward over time as we ensure that we're matching the right assets to the right applications. And certainly some of those churn decisions creates some headwinds, but our view is if managing through those headwinds is required to protect our long-term returns, then that's absolutely what we're going to do. So in terms of precise outlook, very hard to be exact about churn level, quarter by quarter. But we feel very confident that we've addressed, actually, maybe customers that we think moved -- need to move to multi-tiered architectures, as I said, quarter-over-quarter, as we look at key renewals. It can be a bit more volatile. But I do expect that it will moderate over time and allow us to expand our net bookings' performance.","Stephen M. Smith","And then, Colby, I think you had a question -- what was the question on...","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Sales cycle in Europe?","Stephen M. Smith","Sales cycle in Europe I would describe as like every other company in Europe, there's been some delayed decisions with probably some enterprises. But generally speaking, we performed very well in Europe. Our team has exceeded expectations in top and bottom lines. We get the advantage as we talked about in terms of pouring inbound bookings into Europe. Actually, this last quarter Europe exported as much as they've been importing from the U.S. in a quarter. So the global sales team has started to really kick in and push bookings around the globe. So doing very well in the U.K., doing very well in Paris with the new asset, as Keith described, is 50% sold, preassigned. And so, in general, I would tell you probably because it's fortunate we're in the good markets, we're performing quite well, and they have the benefit of the global sales team pushing business into Europe.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I guess what I was getting at, Steve, was I think you made comments at the Investor Conference that you're seeing weakness in Frankfurt and Switzerland a few weeks ago and I was curious if that was still the situation.","Stephen M. Smith","Well, I don't -- I think the question was posed to me, which markets are the hottest markets and which markets are at the other end of that and the German market is a little bit tougher market from a competitive standpoint. There's a lot deeper competition, which obviously puts pressure on price. But this past year, our German market actually grew, including the ancotel acquisition, almost 30%, just under 30%. And without ancotel, it was in the high teens. So the growth of our German businesses is still doing fine. It's just a little bit more acute in terms of the competitive nature, much deeper in Germany than in almost any other market in the world. And that's what I was referring to.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Jon Atkin [RBC Capital Markets].","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was interested about the adjusted discretionary free cash flow for 2013. You increased your guidance by $20 million at midpoint and what drove that, given that you kept the revenue and the EBITDA guidance the same and the CapEx guidance? And then secondly, operationally, I was wondering if you've seen any impacts from the property divestiture to 365 Main?","Keith D. Taylor","Okay, I'll take the first one. So, Jon, when we adjusted the adjusted discretionary free cash flow when we gave the initial guidance it had some conservatism built into it. We wanted to see how we're going to perform in Q4 and then also how that was going to lead it into the 2013 time period. But also as we looked more at our internal budgets, Steve and I just came off December roadshow where we met all the regions and reviewed the budget, we had a much better sense of the timing of when we're going to actually spend money and not spend money in. So when we took all of that into consideration and recognizing, if you will, the size of the range that we originally had, we felt that we can give a little bit on this call. And so we've modified the range up to the 6 20 to 6 40.","Charles Meyers","And relative to the divestiture of the assets to 365 Main I'd say we've been extremely pleased with how that's gone. Really no substantive adverse impacts. I think kudos to the internal team here who had put a ton of effort into making sure that we had the planning effort up front, so that we could not impact customers. 365 has been a great partner in that. And we've had a couple of situations relative to splitting contracts and various other things that customers need us to help them work through, et cetera. And the inevitable bumps and irritations that may cause customers. But we took great pains to preplan that and put money aside to invest to make sure that the transition went smoothly and, overall, I would say it has.","Operator","Our final question comes from Mr. Gray Powell [Wells Fargo Securities].","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just had one quick one. So net leverage looks like it's about 2.6x today versus your 3x to 4x target, in other data center REITs that's over 5x. Just how should we think about leverage and your use of cash given that EBITDA is growing about 20% per year, which gives you capital to reinvest and the fact that you're now free cash flow positive?","Keith D. Taylor","Yes. So, Gray, a couple of things, certainly as we've said in the past, last I checked, the company will go through a fairly meaningful deleveraging through 2015, 2016 time period. Recognizing that there's a number of things that are taking place, and we're in the middle of our PLR submission to the IRS. Not understanding exactly where that's all going to come out, the company has obligations that we'll have to meet from a cash perspective including E&P purge including incremental taxes, of course, we're going to continue to invest in the business organically through capital allocation towards the construction projects. So that all said, I think what's important to note is the company has great flexibly as we look forward.  Part of what we want to look at is optimizing the balance sheet, making sure we have the appropriate level of leverage on the books. It's going to be a little bit different than others and perhaps some of the other data center REITs primarily because we've targeted a 3x to 4x net leverage target. Our contracts tend to be shorter than theirs. And so when you look at sort of the relative exposure to the balance sheet, you want to make sure you marry up that exposure with, basically, your leverage, that will be one thing. But the other thing I think is important, as Steve noted. We're also going to continue to grow the business organically. We'll also look at inorganic opportunity, and we also have to look at what distributions do we have to do and do we do to our shareholders within the REIT structure and outside of the REIT structure. So all that has to be contemplated. So if I could take that together and summarize it, right now we have a tremendous amount of flexibility and we're going to continue to look at our capital allocation strategy and we'll update you over the next few calls as we hear back from the IRS, and we start to move more and more towards that REIT conversion.","Katrina Rymill","That concludes our Q4 call.

In the interest of wrapping this call in an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one. ","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report that Equinix delivered strong financial results in the first quarter and a great start to 2012. As shown on Slide 3, revenues were $452.2 million, up 5% quarter-over-quarter and 25% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $215.2 million for the quarter, up 29% over the same quarter last year. We continue to see growth through high-value deployments where application performance and reliability matter, resulting in record bookings in all 3 operating regions this quarter. ","Our focus on creating digital ecosystems and the corresponding vertical alignment of our sales force is reflected in our market momentum, particularly in the network and cloud segments. By targeting customer applications that fully leverage the advantage of Platform Equinix, we continue to see a very favorable deal mix and a healthy pricing environment. ","The breadth of our global platform remains a unique competitive advantage. In this quarter, we exported record bookings across regional boundaries. Currently, 59% of our monthly recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple countries, reinforcing the value of our global platform. ","As the Internet continues to scale, the global data center market remains as dynamic as ever. Trends such as mobility, cloud computing, data management and social media are at the heart of this shift. There are more people interacting with data than ever before, and the world's effective capacity to exchange information through telecommunications network is predicted to reach approximately 670 exabyte annually in 2013. These global trends are forcing architecture decisions to place network data centers at the heart of multitiered architecture deployments. Our network-dense IBX stood at the intersection of these business and technology trends as a solution to both cost and performance challenges. ","As we continue to accumulate private, public and hybrid cloud deployments across Platform Equinix, we are creating a marketplace for buyers and sellers of cloud services to transact. Equinix IBXs are important locations for our cloud and SaaS customers to host their services and gain access to customers and partners across our platform. Similarly, CIOs of major corporations see Equinix IBXs as critical points to access cloud vendors to optimize application performance while maintaining security and reliability for their architecture. Equinix's goal is to assist customers, both cloud vendors and users, to leverage the cloud seamlessly. ","The vertical ecosystems being formed inside Equinix underscore these trends and point to a vibrant ever-changing digital economy. The financial services industry is undergoing historic transformation. Deregulation and globalization have spawned a global community of financial institutions connecting to share data and transact across an entire platform of data centers. Bloomberg is deployed in 7 Equinix markets where they are connecting directly to the most important trading infrastructure around the world to ensure critical information is available in real time to the trading communities. Increasingly, this industry is also looking to private cloud services for fast, secure and reliable transactions, which is fueling the growth of interconnection between our cloud and financial ecosystem. Other industries are undergoing similar changes that CIOs architect their infrastructure to incorporate mobility, cloud and advanced data analytics to ensure quality real time transactions. This quarter, one of the world's largest logistics company selected Platform Equinix to more efficiently manage its delivery services system, which sit at the heart of their business success. The digital supply chain is transforming how companies sell, price, produce and deliver products and services, and Equinix data centers are what businesses need to fulfill the requirements of this new economy. ","As a complement to the growth in our ecosystems, we are also in the early stages of developing a program to ensure best-of-breed solutions are available to customers who are looking for a simple way to deploy infrastructure and buy other services in our data centers. Many enterprise customers seek bundled solutions, and service providers inside of our data centers are eager to gain access to our diverse customer base. ","We are focused on cloud solutions such as hybrid cloud, security and Storage as a Service. Customers have access to many providers, including Amazon, Carpathia, Citrix, Nirvanix, RightScale and Tier 3 just to name a few, and we continue to evaluate ways to work with other providers to help them deliver easy-to-deploy products and services for their entire customer base. ","Let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to review the financials for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor","Thanks, Steve. And good afternoon to everyone on the call today. I'm pleased to provide you with additional details on our first quarter results and with the exception of the consolidated financial results, all other key metrics exclude the impact of ALOG. ","So starting on Slide 4 from our presentation posted today. Our Q1 financial results were better than expectations in each of the 3 regions with particular strength in the Americas. Global Q1 revenues were $452.2 million, a 5% quarter-over-quarter increase and up 25% over the same quarter last year. This healthy increase was in part due to a $2.8 million early termination fee negotiated with a customer in the U.K. Our quarterly revenues were slightly impacted by the negative currency trends in the quarter, reducing revenues by $500,000 when compared to the average rates used in Q4 or $600,000 when compared to the FX rates from our guidance. ","Our pricing across each of the regions remained firm both on an MRR per cabinet basis and on a unit pricing basis. Global MRR churn was approximately 2.4%, a slight increase over the prior quarter yet within our targeted range of 1.5% to 2.5% per quarter. This quarter's churn reflects the renewed focus on IBX optimization as we work to maximize our return on invested capital across our asset base. The U.K. churn previously noted is a great example of our IBX optimization effort: a customer's picking us to downsize their footprint of unused space. Consistent with our strategy, we've already resold a portion of the space at higher prices to support the deployment of a large U.S. bank's critical trading platform. This is what we consider to be positive churn. ","The benefits of this strategy are clear to us. It will improve our pricing and margins. We will recapture inventory in our most critical IBXs and will improve our ROIC. Given this strategy, we expect our MRR churn metric to fluctuate throughout the remainder of 2012. In particular in Q2, we expect to see slightly elevated churn all contemplated within our guidance. ","Global cash gross profit for the quarter was $311.6 million, or cash gross margin of 69%, higher than our initial expectations in part due to stronger-than-expected revenues, better-than-planned lease cost and tax savings and a favorable settlement with one of our general contractors in the EU region. Our cash gross profit increased 8% over the prior quarter and 30% over the same quarter last year despite the level of expansion currently underway in each of our regions. Looking forward, we expect our cash gross profit to decrease slightly due to higher seasonal utility rates. ","Global cash SG&A expenses were $96.5 million for the quarter, slightly higher than our guidance largely due to $4.6 million in costs related to our global IT initiatives and approximately $2.9 million of increased expense related to the annual reset of the employer paid FICA and other related costs. Looking forward, we expect our cash SG&A expenses to increase over Q1 as we continue to invest in our global IT initiatives and other key projects. ","Global adjusted EBITDA was $215.2 million for the quarter, a 48% EBITDA margin or a 9% improvement over the prior quarter and up 29% over the same quarter last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin reflects strong revenue performance and higher-than-expected cash gross profit margin, offset by slightly higher than planned SG&A. On a normalized basis, taking on the net one-off benefits for this quarter, our global adjusted EBITDA would have been $211.5 million or a 47% normalized EBITDA margin rate. ","Global net income was $34.5 million for the quarter, a 37% improvement over the same quarter last year, the results of our strong operating performance. Fully diluted earnings per share was $0.71, which included the dilutive impact of 2.9 million shares from our 3% convertible debt. Next quarter, we expect our depreciation and amortization expense to increase by approximately $4 million due to expansion openings. ","Looking forward, the U.S. dollar exchange rates used for Q2 and 2012 guidance remain unchanged at $1.31 to the euro, $1.58 for the pound and SGD $1.25 to the U.S. dollar. Our updated global revenue breakdown by currency for the euro and pound is 13% and 8%, respectively, and the Singapore dollar represents about 6%. The largest currency impact on our forward guidance both for Q2 and the rest of the year, is the weakening Australian dollar, Brazilian real and Japanese yen. ","Now before I go into the regions, I want to quickly discuss our position on tax. First, for the quarter, our effective book tax rate was approximately 29%. Our current NOL position remains at approximately $450 million of federal NOLs, which should take us into 2014 or even possibly 2015 before we pay any meaningful federal cash taxes. ","As discussed on a prior earnings call, we're taking a serious look at our global tax strategies, which includes assessing the feasibility and the applicability of Equinix converting into a REIT structure. We have engaged advisers and convinced diligence to assess this tax structure. While we consider this ongoing assessment to be very important to our global tax strategy, we want you to know that we'll continue to focus on profitably growing our business in both our core and noncore markets. ","Now given the status of our assessment, at this time we're not able to provide you with any additional update on certainty or timing. And on a related note, included in our SG&A guidance is an incremental $2 million of anticipated spend for the initial cost of the REIT analysis for 2012. ","So turning to Slide 5. I'd like to review the regional results starting with Americas. Americas revenues grew 4% quarter-over-quarter to $288.1 million. Cash gross margins increased to 71%. Adjusted EBITDA was $137.8 million, an increase of 4% over the last quarter and up 21% over the same quarter last year. Americas adjusted EBITDA margin was 48% for the quarter, which also absorbed the higher costs related to the corporate functions, including the IT initiatives. ","Net cabinets billing increased by 940 in the quarter, a meaningful increase over the prior quarter. The Americas sales force had a record bookings in Q1, with especially strong performance in network, content and digital media and cloud and IT services verticals. Also, the Americas region exported a record level of deal volume to both EMEA and AP regions this quarter. Overall deal size and pricing continued to trend very positively across the verticals and appropriately reflects our effort to target interconnection-rich customers. ","On a separate note, our ALOG asset performed well in the quarter and continues to maintain a strong sales funnel. For the quarter, ALOG's revenues increased 8% over the prior quarter's $18.7 million despite the weakening Brazilian currency. ","During the quarter, Americas interconnection revenue, excluding ALOG, continued to perform well and we added a healthy increase of about 1,500 cross-connects in the quarter. Americas interconnection revenue continued to represent approximately 20% of the region's recurring revenues. Also during Q1, we opened our DC 10 business suites offering and have already sold greater than 60% of the capacity. Our success today allowed us to proceed with the second phase of this project as we announced on the last earnings call. ","We continue to be optimistic about this offering in the D.C. market. Also today, we announced the construction of a new IBX for the greater Miami market. Our new Miami 3 facility located in Boca Raton is the home to several major fiber-optic cable landing stations and provides the lowest latency route to Brazil, allowing Equinix to meet the increasing customer demands for the South American market. We're also expanding our New York 7 asset in addition to our planned opening of New York 5 in Q3 this year. ","Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 6. EMEA had a strong quarter with record bookings, with particular strength in the U.K. and Germany markets despite the continued negative economic backdrop. Revenues were up 6% sequentially or 8% on a constant currency basis driven by strong bookings and the one-off customer termination fee. ","Adjusted EBITDA increased to $46.9 million or adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%, an 18% improvement over the prior quarter and up 53% compared to the same quarter last year. Part of the recent success is attributed to one-off benefits in revenues and cost of revenues previously discussed. Our normalized EBITDA in the region would have been 42% this quarter. The region's net billing cabinets increased by 490, and we had a greater than 1,000 cross-connects this quarter. Interconnection revenues continue to be 4% of the region's recurring revenues. ","The EMEA business continues to perform well, and I also like to highlight the recent momentum in the Swiss market. As previously announced, the Swiss stock exchange deployed one of our -- deployed into one of core Zurich assets. This strategic win, along with a focus on network-dense secured data centers in Switzerland, provided us the opportunity to build a fifth data center in Zurich as well as further expand our Geneva 2 IBX. ","The new Zurich site will be connected by a fiber ring to the Zurich campus, offering direct connectivity to greater than 75 carriers. The Zurich 5 build complements our other strategic builds in Amsterdam, in Frankfurt, in London, Paris, all expected to open in the second half of this year. ","And now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to Slide 7. Asia Pacific revenues improved 7% sequentially or 6% on a constant currency basis, with strong net bookings across each of our countries. Asia Pacific also benefited from large inbound deals from both the Americas and EMEA regions. ","Adjusted EBITDA was $30.5 million, up 20% quarter-over-quarter, partly due to one-off expenses in Q4 and up 32% over the same quarter last year. We continue to see our Hong Kong business gain traction in the financial vertical, which allowed us to build the second phase of our Hong Kong 2 IBX, which will open up later this quarter. ","Cabinets billing increased by almost 200 over the prior quarter and unit pricing remained steady despite the weakening currency environment in Australia and Japan. Asia Pacific also had a greater than 700 cross-connects in the quarter, and interconnection revenues continue to represent 12% of the region's recurring revenues. ","And now looking at the balance sheet data, please refer to Slide 8. Our unrestricted cash and investment balance at quarter end was $1.1 billion, reflecting our strong operating performance in the quarter. Thus with the quarter end, we cash settled the principal value of our 2.5% $250 million convertible debt, thereby reducing our cash balance to approximately $830 million on a pro forma basis. ","We continued to implement shareholder friendly actions. By the end of Q1, we'd also repurchased a total of approximately 1 million shares for $100 million. Both the share repurchase and the debt repayment reduced our outstanding share count or avoided incremental dilution of 2.6 million shares. ","Looking at the liability side of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with gross debt of $3.08 billion in debt. Thus since quarter end, our gross debt balance reduced to $2.83 billion or about 3.4x our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA or net debt leverage of roughly 2.4x Q1 annualized EBITDA. ","Now looking at Slide 9. Our Q1 operating cash flow was $126 million, and our discretionary free cash flow was $82.9 million, or $1.77 per share based on our basic weighted average share count in the quarter, a 42% and 7% decrease over the prior quarter and the same quarter last year largely due to the seasonal change in our working capital. In Q1, we saw a net decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a net increase in accounts receivable. This total change was approximately $102 million. We continue to expect our 2012 discretionary free cash flow to range between $500 million and $540 million or approximately range between $10 and $11 per share. ","Looking at capital expenditures, please refer to Slide 10. For the quarter, CapEx was $145.5 million, below expectations largely due to the timing of cash payments. Our expansion projects remain on time and on budget. Ongoing capital expenditures were $43.1 million, higher than the initial guidance and reflect an increase in installation and success-based projects and additional spending on IBX optimization projects. ","Now turning to Slide 11. The operating performance of our 23 North America IBX and expansion projects that have been open for more than one year continue to perform well. Currently, these projects are 85% utilized and generate a 33% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested. For our 8 oldest U.S. IBXs, revenues grew 10% year-over-year as customers continue to buy additional power in cross-connect as well as space as it becomes available through our optimization initiatives. This shows the continuing value of our network density and ecosystems, the longevity and economic life of our assets and the importance of these assets to the infrastructure of the Internet. ","So now let me turn the call back to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Thanks, Keith. Now I'd like to provide a deeper view into our Asia Pacific region and then close out with an update of our 2012 guidance. ","Asia Pacific is the fastest-growing region for Equinix and an area of tremendous potential for us. Emerging market customers are growing in importance, while multinationals continue to invest in this region because of its growing economy, economic stability and strong foreign reserves and they're accelerating their deployment of Internet infrastructure to support their products and services. ","If you turn to Slide 12, you can see that over the last 4 years, revenues have grown at a 39% compounded annual growth rate. EBITDA margin has improved from 29% in 2007 to 46% in 2011, and interconnection has grown to become a meaningful component of the recurring revenue. Platform Equinix is the only premium brand with a Pan-Asian offering, and multinationals such as IBM, Fujitsu, British Telecom and many others are expanding into the Asia Pacific markets as shown on Slide 13. Over 30% of the top 500 global companies are headquartered in Asia, and as the economy develops, we will work to bring these Asia-based multinationals to the other regions that we serve. ","Turning to Slide 14. Each of our 5 markets has unique market dynamics. In Singapore, telecom deregulation and government initiatives have established this market as the business and telecom hub of Asia Pacific, creating a tremendous opportunity for telecommunications firms. Our Singapore market is a well-known peering hub that has grown to over 170 networks, with the largest number of cross-connects in Asia Pacific. Recently, Amazon Web services deployed their direct connect offering in our Singapore data center to capture the growing demand in this market for private and hybrid cloud services. ","AWS Direct Connect is also deployed in Tokyo, another market where cloud services are in high demand. With 43 networks and direct access to several Transpacific and Inter Asia-Pacific submarine systems, our Tokyo campus is one of the most connected in the country. We also host the 3 top Japanese Internet exchanges, including our own. We have seen renewed momentum in Tokyo this year driven by multinationals selling into Japan, as well as from the growth of the electronic trading ecosystem where we recently won several magnet customers. ","The Sydney market is also experiencing strong growth in financial services, with wins including Chi-X Australia. In April 2011, Chi-X Australia deployed its matching engine in our Sydney data center where the financial services ecosystem was starting to form. Since that time, the number of financial services customers deployed in Sydney has increased by 60%, with the majority of these new firms, including Bloomberg and ASX, joining to connect to Chi-X. This speaks to the Equinix value proposition and the importance of proactively helping customers engage with their digital ecosystem to extract the highest possible business value. ","In Hong Kong, the financial ecosystem is also thriving inside Equinix, with customers such as Bloomberg, ABN AMRO clearing, as well as the Hong Kong market dollar exchange, a critical magnet customer in that market. Hong Kong is also the main entry point into China. In Shanghai, we have a partnership with Shanghai Data Solution for a small footprint, which has shown strong demand from multinational customers looking to expand in this high-growth market. As one of the fastest-growing co-location markets in the world, China is the most requested market for Equinix customers looking to expand globally, and we are evaluating opportunities to expand further in this key market. ","Slide 15 outlines our 2012 guidance. For the second quarter of 2012, we expect revenues to be in the range of $466 million to $468 million, which includes absorbing about $3 million of currency headwinds. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between $100 million and $104 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $212 million and $214 million, a 3% quarter-over-quarter increase on a normalized FX neutral basis. Capital expenditures are expected to range between $240 million and $260 million, including approximately $40 million of ongoing capital expenditures. ","For the full year 2012, we are raising our revenue expectation to greater than $1.89 billion or greater than 18% growth on a year-over-year basis, which includes roughly $9 million of currency headwinds relative to the guidance range provided on our last call. Total year cash gross margins are expected to be 67%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between $390 million and $420 million. We are raising expected adjusted EBITDA for the year to be greater than $860 million, which includes a $10 million increase from the global IT initiatives and the REIT feasibility analysis and roughly $4 million of currency headwinds to the prior guidance range. We are maintaining our total CapEx guidance for 2012 at a range of $700 million to $800 million, which includes $135 million of ongoing capital expansion. ","So in closing, as you can see, we're off to a very good start in 2012. Both the external secular trends and our internal operating metrics point to another year of strong and predictable growth. Our rigorous focus on building interconnected ecosystems is providing more differentiation for Equinix, while cementing our identity as the interconnection platform for leading businesses worldwide. Strong performance in all 3 regions with on-time and on-budget execution of our capital plan and all-time high operational reliability have us very well positioned with our customers and prospects to help them embrace the digital economy this year and in the future. ","So at this time, I'd like to stop there and open up for questions. So Amber, I'll turn it back over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two questions, actually. First, with respect to the sales force, can you give us an update to the quota-bearing salespeople at the end of the quarter versus the end of last year and describe how those incremental salespeople are contributing to the bookings environment, or is it sort of half a contribution or full contribution and how to think about that pacing? And then separately, if I can just follow up, you mentioned the process of hiring advisers to consider the whole REIT structure. As part of that, is the management team and board going through a deeper strategic review? And if so, are there a range of topics that you could describe to us that you guys are considering as you go through that?","Stephen M. Smith","Sure, Mike, I'll start out and take the first one on the sales force and maybe Charles can supplement with the biggest region activity in the U.S. But just to size it for you, we're just under a couple hundred sales reps around the world, call it 100 in Americas, 55 or so in Europe and then around 27, 28 in Asia. So that's the quota-carrying sales force. And in general, the productivity per rep is up across the region. So certainly, we're measuring it both on the tenured reps and the untenured reps, but it is definitely moving up into the right, and is moving in the right direction. At the same time, we're adding complexity to what we're selling with the partnerships, et cetera, and we're arming the sales force to go to the market vertically. So they're learning how to speak in an industry vertical, and so that's all part of the mix. But we're very happy with where it's progressing. And Charles, maybe a comment on certain U.S....","Charles Meyers","Yes, Mike, I think obviously given the strong bookings performance in the quarter, we feel very good about the continued evolution of the sales team. As Steve said, we're seeing strong up into the right trend and rep productivity and saw healthy increases in productivity, both on tenured and new reps in Q1. Based on the success of our network and financial services sales teams, we actually made the decision to fully vertically align the Americas team, and we believe that will continue to drive productivity throughout 2012. Overall pipeline is solid, coverage is good. And to answer your question directly, the new reps are not yet fully productive. As we said, we are ramping them to productivity. But again, I think we should continue to see on a pro rep basis increased productivity as we continue to mature the reps through their learning process. But overall, we're very pleased with the progress.","Keith D. Taylor","Great. And Mike, on the second question, actually it's a great question. I think how we'd like to frame it today is first and foremost, it is to look at our global tax strategy. And sort of as attached to my comments, my prepared remarks, it's really about also making sure that we focus on growth. And I think in tandem, those are the 2 most important things to take away from today. Having said all of that, the first step really is to think about the feasibility of the REIT structure. Can we do it? And then of course then you'd also think if you can do it, should we do it and ultimately, how do you execute against it? And clearly, the execution part, which as part of this process, our core senior management and the board will be very active in. But right now, let me just say we're in the feasibility side of the review.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Goldman of Goldman Sachs.","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple. First, Keith, maybe you could talk a little bit about the revenue growth as you think about it exiting 2012. I was just looking through the numbers and what you have for 2Q guidance. You're going to be growing the first half of the year slightly over 20%, yet the back half guidance using full year numbers would imply probably 14%, 15% revenue growth. So just sort of wondering how you think about revenue growth as you exit 2012. And then secondly, maybe you could talk a little bit about capital spend, and you've announced a number of expansions since even the last call and a couple more today on your tracking sheet. So maybe you could talk to us a little bit about what the -- how much remains unallocated, if anything, on the original CapEx guidance that you put out?","Keith D. Taylor","Okay. Great questions, Scott. Let me first start in sort of, if you will, normalized Q1, because I think it's important to understand what it ultimately is. And if you actually step back, Q1, taking out the one-offs, is roughly $448.5 million. So that's the first thing to start with. When you then go to the guidance we deliver, it was $467 million at midpoint. If you add the $3 million in currency, you're roughly at $470 million. When you look at $470 million relative to $448 million, you're growing your revenues quarter-over-quarter about almost just under 5%, 4.8%. I believe that those are the guidance rates. As we continue to move through the year, we expect to continue to scale the business. The guidance that we're delivering today is a greater than, as we have always said, we like to give you the greater than and it gives us a little bit more flexibility. But suffice it to say, as you get to the back end of the year, we're going to exit with a relatively large number when you think about the guidance that we've delivered. But more importantly, the second half of the year has more currency embedded in it. As Steve said, there's $9 million of currency, which can be quite dilutive to the business and the exit rates. So principally said, we feel good about the direction we're going. We think Q2 is a good number to anchor off of as we continue to run the business and scale and, as Charles alluded to, drive the reps to a broader productivity, we think that we can continue to grow at a healthy rate. When it comes to the CapEx side of the equation, the nice thing is what we said last year was we deployed in the second half last year and we're holding true to this year. We really wanted to give you our best thoughts on what guidance would be. I recognize it's a relatively large range at $700 million to $800 million, but that guidance contemplated of course some of the projects that we've announced. So we're not modifying our guidance right now. We feel very good about the midrange of that guidance, and as we continue to review projects, we'll adjust accordingly. But at this point, at this stage of the game, we feel very good about the annual guidance that we're delivering.","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up to that. I mean, do you think that if you were to go out and announce any further expansions that could see some capacity come on in late '12 or 2013 that, that could necessitate having to increase that guidance? Or do you feel as though there may still be some capacity in there if you're thinking about the midpoint right now?","Keith D. Taylor","Certainly, we have a little bit more capacity if we so chose to utilize it. Suffice to say, it's unlikely, unless it's a relatively small project, that you could construct something and bring it online this year at this stage. It's not to say that -- there's certainly all the small projects under -- smaller than the 400 cabinets that we put on the expansion track which overall was working. Charles is going through an extensive exercise as he looks at his asset pool and decides where can he optimize, where can he augment, where can he recapture. And sometimes that requires us making some small discrete investment in CapEx, but that's all contemplated in the numbers we've given you. And so I feel very good, again, about the guidance we've delivered. At this point, I would tell you I can't see going above the top end of the range, and right now we feel very comfortable at the midpoint of the range.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Looking at the project there for the -- I'm seeing the underutilized space, expecting churn to be up a little bit, how long would it take to complete that exercise? And then what's sort of the revenue opportunity here if you see similar success from the first quarter? And then second question, sort of what's more the long-term outlook for the exposure you want in China? Are you going to stay with Hong Kong and Shanghai for a while, or should we look for expansion into other Chinese markets as well?","Keith D. Taylor","Good questions. Let me take the first part of the churn, and I'm going to pass it to Charles who will give you a more sort of regional view of what's going on. But I think when you think about the churn in and of itself, to the extent that we recapture churn like we talked about in the U.K., and then there are other examples, last year, where we recaptured space in Frankfurt and Munich from a large content company where basically there was a lot of revenue churn, per se, that had no impact to our margins, it was actually those value -- or margin-eroding. And so by replacing that capacity, it allowed us to see our profitability go up. [indiscernible] is no different in this circumstance and the U.K. instances where the customer was not fully utilizing the space and is in one of our critical assets, as I said, London is one of the ones out in style, and we are able to recapture some of that space from the customer and allowed them to reduce the burden and give us the payment to offset some of that contracts for commitment. And then we turned around and sold it to a U.S. [indiscernible] firm and they're going to put their -- sort of their trading platform inside that asset. Again, it's highly focused on going out to the right ecosystem. And we like to think, and you've heard me say before probably, it's the right customer going in the right IBX with the right application. And if we continue to do that, we're willing to tolerate higher churn from that perspective, recognizing that we got to backfill it with more valuable customers. And so let me just pass it to Charles at this point.","Charles Meyers","Keith, I think you covered a lot of the key points. I mean churn has been a significant area of focus for us for the past 18 months or so. We're very pleased with the progress. As Keith said, as I've often said to folks out there on the road, the best long-term way to mitigate churn is to ensure that we put the right customers with the right applications and the right assets. And I believe our targeting and our deal discipline to do that are now firmly in place. And we have churn of various types and all those create some level of revenue headwinds. But frankly, I think our level of bad -- what we would consider to be bad churn is very manageable and well inside of our targeted ranges. And on the good churn side, there is churn that we embrace and candidly often catalyze as part of a very disciplined renewal process and part of moving customers to multitiered architectures. And when we do that, we think we dramatically improve the overall productivity of our assets. And so that's one lever, and then we have a number of others. I think in your question you asked kind of how long that would continue. I think we have continued opportunities to optimize our assets. We see an imbalance between space utilization and power utilization in some of our key assets. We're investing in space projects where we can to sup up some of that at very high IRRs. And we're continuing to work on that. I think if you look at Slide 11 of the deck, you'll see that our ability to continue to squeeze better performance out of our mature assets continues to be there.","Stephen M. Smith","And Frank, on your second question on China, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are currently evaluating opportunity to expand our presence in Shanghai and, ultimately, we'd be interested in Beijing and possibly even other provinces over time. But Shanghai, probably to get started, would be of high interest because we've tested that market with a partner in that market that's been a very good partner and we've done very well there. On the small footprint, but we've done very well. But as I stated, the demand for our customers that want to go international, particularly in Asia Pacific, is very, very high in Shanghai. Our brand, our reliability reputation is very strong in China. We have plenty of opportunities. And I guess I would just tell you to stay tuned.","Operator","Our next call comes from James Breen with William Blair.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just 2 questions. One, with respect to CapEx, as you look at the breakdown that you provided in the slides, it seems like CapEx is moving up in the U.S. and down in EMEA and Asia. Can you just sort of give us color in terms of what your thoughts are there? And you also -- you make note that the continuing sort of maintenance CapEx levels are around 7% coming down to 5%. Do those differ considerably across the different regions right now given the different growth stages the regions are in? And then secondly, just on Asia Pacific, you mentioned that 12% of MRR are cross-connects now. Do you see that going to that 20% level that you're in, in the U.S., and will that help drive profitability in that region?","Keith D. Taylor","Just filling in with I guess the first part of the question on spend. Clearly, they're point specific. It depends on the markets. We're always looking at the opportunity that's in front of us, and we spend a lot of energy as a company looking at our bill rates. And so sometimes, one region will be more heavily weighted than another region, no different last year, when you looked at Asia Pacific, we spent more than 100% of revenues on our growth or our capital expansion initiatives. This year, we didn't have to make the same level of investment, although we're continuing to invest quite heavily as a percent of revenue for the Asia Pacific market. Europe, there's a lot of spend that took place last year, and we're continuing to invest this year. But when you think about the opportunity, there are facts and circumstances specific based on the fill rate and the opportunity that we have in that given market. And so I don't get overly concerned about, if you will, percentages at any point in time because we continue to look at each of our assets. And as Charles alluded to and as we as an organization are focusing on, we're just trying to maximize that opportunity that's in front of us. So hopefully, that addresses your question vis-a-vis the regional breakdown.","Stephen M. Smith","And I think on your second question, James, in Asia Pacific, we don't have a stated goal that's in that range. Today it operates, in this quarter was 12% of monthly recurring revenue versus 20% in the Americas and 4% in Europe. The worldwide percentage as a percent of recurring revenue is around 15%. So that's -- I mean we obviously are focused on interconnected ecosystems, so we're trying to drive that number up. The Asia Pacific team has made tremendous progress over the last 3, 4 years in doing that. But the specific answer to your question is we'd love to see it go to 20%, but that's not a stated goal for the company, but it will continue to move up. We're absolutely focused on it.","Keith D. Taylor","And James, if I could just add one other thing to Steve's comment. I think it's also important to recognize that, certainly, we like to think that interconnection revenue as a percentage of revenue will go up, but you have to also recognize there's a tremendous benefit to the pull-through that hit the other lines. And so some markets and some regions have a different pricing structure than we have in the U.S. And so from our perspective, as long as we can continue to get that right customer with the right asset inside our data centers, they're going to be willing to pay an appropriate amount for that capacity, and that overall will drive the right returns on an overall basis. So again, it's an important metric, but you shouldn't look at it just on a one-sided basis because there's real benefits on the other lines as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just had a couple of quick ones. Can you give us a sense as to the growth rate in each of your key verticals, those being like IT and cloud, financial services, network and enterprise? And then can you talk about initiatives to improve momentum in your enterprise verticals? It just seems like with the growth that you're having in your cloud ecosystem, that there could be some sort of a pull-through there with enterprise customers.","Stephen M. Smith","Sure, Gray. I'll start and then Charles can probably add some to that because we really are digging deep into enabling enterprises to take advantage of the cloud. But on the growth rate, if I can give you just color of the bookings this quarter, it will give you a sense of how they sell. Roughly 26% of the bookings in the first quarter were tied to networks. We're seeing great, great focus in growth with the networks with Ethernet and LTE and all the new services that are rolling out. So they're upgrading and we're benefiting from that. About 22% of the bookings was from cloud, so we continue to see very good upside and deployments of public, private and hybrid cloud nodes. Financial was roughly 18%, and that was a little bit lower than what that is as a percentage of revenue, but we have a very strong pipeline as we look to the end of the year. So that's very cyclical. Content, digital media companies were roughly 24%, and I would say that the color underneath that is tied to the big global platform players who are deploying cloud-like nodes and infrastructure all over the world and we're benefiting from that. And then enterprise is roughly 10% of bookings in the first quarter. But we're very focused on enterprise. Most of the historic go-to-market for us has been with network, cloud, financial and content digital media. We haven't really focused on enterprise, per se, except for a little bit in Europe and in some markets. But we are staring at it pretty hard now. We're seeing some good positive signs in health care. We're seeing some good positive signs in business and professional services. And I don't know, Charles, you can probably give a little more color on that.","Charles Meyers","Yes. I can give a little more color on Steve's comments and then particularly address the enterprise question and the pull-through to the cloud. The bookings can be a little bit deceptive at times. But I'd tell you just right now, I think in the business we're seeing real strength in the network space just to continue the network density, and the platform that we've built continues to have momentum. Real momentum in cloud as well, and in some of the other areas it can be a little lumpier. But cloud is certainly an area of strength right now. And as you noted, I think that has a very strong potential to proceed strength in the enterprise, meaning we talk a lot about the cloud-enabled enterprise as a specific area where we're seeing demand for Platform Equinix and particularly on a global basis. And I think that that's going to continue to be the case as virtually every enterprise CIO is right now tackling what cloud -- what are we doing to really leverage the cloud, looking at public, private, hybrid cloud architectures, and Equinix is really the home for that.","Operator","And next, we have Colby Synesael with Cowen.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","First question, I just wanted to talk about the partnerships. I'm curious how you're going to be balancing out the best-of-breed strategy versus staying neutral. So for example, when you start to partner with an AWS or a Rackspace for that matter, what's the risk that you're actually going to be pushing away other companies that actually compete against those guys and may feel that you're now perhaps more aligning yourself with them? And also, is the value of these partnerships really just that it's making your facilities more sticky, or is there an actual revenue opportunity tied to some of these partnerships? And then I have a follow-up after that.","Stephen M. Smith","Sure, Colby, I'll start. Most of the activity Charles is driving in the Americas were emanating their partnerships out of mostly U.S.-based relationships that end up going global. But generally, the way we're thinking about partnerships is we're just trying to make it easier for our customers to do business inside of our IBXs. So as I've mentioned and Keith mentioned multiple times, we're creating this marketplace inside these IBXs so that customers can see each other. We've made that much easier with a tool. We're taking that to the next level now where we can help them enable solutions. Many of these customers are coming to us and asking us to sell with them, co-develop with them, bring best-of-breed type of solutions to customers. So we're framing all that now. There is some revenue share opportunity. So there's been a handful of announcements that you all have seen that we've made, mostly generated out of the U.S., that will port to international. And then again, it's to facilitate ease of doing business and connecting buyers and sellers inside of our marketplace. Maybe a little more color there?","Charles Meyers","Yes. Steve, I think you covered most of it. Again, one thing I think you guys clearly understand, Platform Equinix at its heart is inherently a digital marketplace. And we've invested heavily in our marketplace capability and improving ability for our customers to gain business value from their participation in our vertical ecosystems. And the partner program really just builds on that foundation. And in certain of our verticals, particularly in enterprise, we see the need for our sales teams to position Platform Equinix as part of a bundled solution that is more directly responsive to the customer needs. And as Steve indicated, really, an ease of doing business with Equinix. And to answer your question, since we're not looking to move up to stack ourselves, partners are a key avenue for us, and we're all about providing choice. So we do not view it as contrary to our position, inherent position and neutrality, but rather providing a complete choice set for our customers. So we are eager to have the full range of service providers in our facilities that customers may want. And we're going to work with best-of-breed players that have value to deliver to our customers. And then to also directly answer your other question in terms of the economic model, it is primarily about ensuring that Platform Equinix gets pulled through by being placed into a relevant business context for our customers. That's the primary economic model. In certain cases where that's less clear, we may employ other economic models in the arrangements, but primarily it's about creating the pull-through and creating a stickiness for the solution long term.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a real quick follow-up. Keith, there's been talk from quarter-to-quarter about some customers being below market and effectively getting them to move up to market prices, or actually pushing them out in churn and then going in reselling that space. Is there still a decent amount of situations like we saw in Frankfurt where you actually will have that opportunity to push customers out if they're not willing to move up to market prices and therefore see a nice immediate improvement, call it over a quarter or 2, just when you resell that space in terms of both revenue and margins, or is that largely behind us at this point?","Keith D. Taylor","Well there's certainly a lot of opportunities out there. It's not always about below market. In some cases, it's about underutilizing the capacity. And again, I refer back to the U.K. example where the customer may have taken down too much capacity. We wanted some of the capacity back. That was a perfect arrangement between the 2 parties that was mutually beneficial. We got some one-off benefit out of it, but we also got the capacity back to sell a higher-value customer. And it goes very much to what Charles has been talking about in his business and how the other 2 regions feel. It's about creating an environment where it becomes more sticky, more interconnection rich, and that there's more value that's created from that incremental deployment. And so I think there's...","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Can you tell us what the delta is between actual utilized space that we see in the numbers and metrics that you provide versus actually being used by the customer?","Stephen M. Smith","We don't have that data, Colby. But suffice it to say, there's the opportunities out there. We made reference to it. Clearly, there's more opportunity in front of us as we continue to look at our assets and how to optimize them. We want to continue to make some enhancements where appropriate to recapture space and bringing balance, more power, power with the space availability, and we're going to continue to do that. We will continue to update you as each quarter goes by. But suffice it to say, we feel very good about what we have in front of us. Obviously, the guidance that you see that we placed for Q2 and beyond, that gives us a very good sense that we can continue to scale the business, we can absorb a little bit more churn than we originally had forecasted. It's good for the business and it's good for the investor.","Charles Meyers","And Colby, managed churn is not our only avenue available to us in that regard. As we said, being able to consume underutilized power, for example, in facilities, being able to free up space and marry it with power to get additional inventory at very low CapEx rates, there's a number of levers available to us to continue to improve the productivity of the assets beyond just the managed churn opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","One housekeeping question and then a couple of strategics, if I may. Keith, I was wondering if you might update us on the RP basket?","Keith D. Taylor","Yes, I certainly can do that. So the RP basket at the end of Q1, we're estimating to be roughly $150 million under the 8.125% facility and is roughly $500 million under the 7% facility. So it gives you a sense. So we'll consume roughly $100 million of the basket and through Q1, we're roughly $252 million of total capacity.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. All right. So 2 questions here on the strategic side. You now have DC 10 opened up for a little while, and Equinix seems to be well situated for really an evolution in the way that customers are using data center space. And Charles, you've said a couple of times private, public, hybrid cloud. And so it's been our perspective that this is going to be a very important paradigm shift over time. So I was wondering if you might give us a little bit more color about what's going on in the data center, if there are kind of hybrid, private, public cloud, if it's being integrated with Amazon Web Services? I'd love to learn a little bit more about how that data center is evolving. And the second strategic question just has a little bit more to do with the M&A environment. Clearly, there are a number of assets that are currently available, some domestically in Canada, Germany, globally. You guys have done a great job of being able to really leverage your global footprint in order to drive demand from one region to another. Are you looking at the M&A environment as a way to complement your current assets and growth?","Charles Meyers","Jon, this is Charles. I'll take the first part on DC 10 and hand it back over to Steve or Keith on the M&A side. But we concur that there is a shift going on in terms of how people are thinking about utilizing data center infrastructure, and the DC 10 asset was part of trying to exploit that. And we talk a lot about multitiered architectures, and those multitiered architectures do play into the sort of public, private, hybrid cloud environment. And to directly answer your question, absolutely, there are people that are actively providing sort of cloud services and public, private, hybrid cloud services out of DC 10, and most often, integrating those with a footprint in the core Ashburn IBX facility, which is obviously very heavily interconnected and taking advantage of the network density that lives there. And it is, in fact, aligned with AWS and being able to gain access to the public cloud. And then move loads and using partners, for example, like RightScale, to move loads across public cloud options and then use the connectivity that's inherent in the Ashburn facility, whether that be Ethernet or other methods of connectivity to create private cloud. So that's all playing together. DC 10 is a very targeted asset for us. We're not trying to be all things to all people, but it is, in fact, a way for us to really allow that multitiered architecture to take place for our customers.","Stephen M. Smith","And Jon, I think on the M&A question, probably the simplest way to think about Equinix going forward, at least in the short term, short to mid term, is that it will facilitate new market entry for us, particularly in the emerging markets where current customers are showing signs of interest. It was behind the Brazil decision, it certainly was behind our decision a couple of years ago to get into Amsterdam. If we can find a partner or an asset that's building the newest data center in that market, that's always attractive to us. But as Keith and I and Charles has probably voiced sort of a little bit on the road is China, India, Middle East, Eastern Europe, all these places are still of interest. It's all driven by customer demand, market data that suggests that this business model would do very well with first mover status. Some of these bigger markets now are starting to show signs that -- and we're being attracted by people in those markets to find a way in there. So it mostly aimed on bolt-on type decisions versus any big scale decisions. We feel like we're in very good shape in the Americas. In Europe, we're quickly becoming -- we're investing more than the prime competitors there, and we're very happy with where we are in Europe. And in Asia, there's lots of opportunity as we talked about today.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. And I know that you have the Analyst Day coming up in June. It'd be super to here maybe from one of those customers in DC 10 who's really taken advantage of that hybrid architecture.","Operator","Our final question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of quick ones as we wrap it up, if I could. Just the bigger picture question, maybe, Steve. Obviously we're seeing the mid of the integration happen now between the Verizons and the Terremarks and the CenturyLinks and the Savvises. It's not clear that they're necessarily outperforming their historical run rate. If you could talk a little bit about if you've got any advantage on the competitive landscape at the margin, that would be great. And then just 2 quickies. Keith, on buyback, could you talk a little bit about the pacing slowdown? You had the headroom in the quarter on the RP basket but you didn't use it. If you could talk a little bit about pacing. And then lastly, just to wrap it up, on going back to where we started, Keith, on the adviser and what you hired them to do. Is part of this process getting an IRS private letter ruling? Is there a plan to -- is part of the feasibility study the need to kind of get the IRS's input in this process?","Stephen M. Smith","I'll go ahead and start on the competition question, David. I think it's still playing itself out. Both of those examples you quoted are both customers of Equinix, continue to be customers of Equinix or continue to grow in our pipelines. For example, the Boca Raton asset that we just announced today is a pretty well-positioned asset as an alternative to the South American market. But generally, they're in our pipeline as customers. We also see them competitively, predominantly in the U.S. So I don't -- we haven't seen a big change in the landscape. I think it's still shaking out in terms of the integration offer and how those companies are operationalizing these things. But no big new news, I don't think. Charles, have you seen anything?","Charles Meyers","No. Again, I think that in many respects, there are complementary ways that we are working together in the marketplace. There are areas of some potential overlap, and I think there is concern on the part of customers about whether or not their new ownership implies a change in their posture relative to network neutrality. And so that [indiscernible] margin perhaps provide us an avenue to have a discussion with the customer about Equinix as their preferred choice. But I wouldn't say that there has been any dramatic shift either way in the market.","Keith D. Taylor","And David, just on the other 2 questions. First, taking the question on the sort of the RP basket capacity. As you think about how we're looking at our priority, first and foremost, it's going to be about profitable growth. We're going to continue to invest in the things that are available to us. And secondly, we're going to focus on those bolt-on acquisitions that Steve referred to, and clearly, that's going to be an important aspect to us. We have said historically that we want to do things on an equity light basis, avoid equity as much as we can. And so to the extent that we do acquisitions, we really would like to be using cash to create value for the shareholder. And then thirdly, obviously, is going to be focusing on continued shareholder return. And so we're going to continue to evaluate on an ongoing basis and it continues to remain a focus for us. So switching gears to your question on the private letter ruling, like anything, first and foremost it is about feasibility. Private letter rulings, I think that would be more at the back end of the assessment, the advisers are on a lot of -- on many complex issues, and it's probably a little early to talk about private letter rulings.","Katrina Rymill","That concludes our Q1 call.

In the interest of wrapping this call within an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Okay. Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. 2015 was a transformational year for Equinix. We delivered accelerated growth, expanded our global platform with two strategic acquisitions, completed our first year operating as a REIT, and established ourselves as a foundation for the cloud ecosystem that continues to drive IT transformation.","Our strong financial performance reflects our position as the global leader in retail colocation and interconnection, truly serving as the place where opportunity connects for leading networks, clouds, content providers and enterprises. We continue to extend our market-leading network density attracting wireline, wireless and increasingly subsea carriers who are using Platform Equinix to efficiently interconnect and serve their end customers.","Our data centers act as a powerful commerce center for the largest service providers to reach their customers and are positioning us to capture the enterprise as they implement next-generation IT architectures. We will further leverage our leadership position through the integration of Telecity and Bit-isle and scale the business to drive even more value for our combined customers.","Before I turn to the quarterly results, I'd like to reflect on a few of the meaningful milestones we achieved in 2015, starting with financial performance on slide three. With another year of record bookings activity in 2015, we generated over $2.7 billion of revenue, up 16% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis.","We delivered over $1.27 billion of adjusted EBITDA or a 47% margin and over 100 basis point improvement over last year while continuing to invest in the business. This drove AFFO growth of 25% on a normalized and constant currency basis, exceeding our prior guidance after adjusting for the Telecity transaction-related FX loss.","Second, it was a phenomenal year for our interconnection solutions. Interconnection revenue continues to outpace overall revenue, growing 20% year-over-year on a constant currency organic basis. That's over 171,000 cross-connects, 3,300 ports on our Internet Exchange, and dramatic growth on our Cloud Exchange we are benefiting from the strong secular trends that are driving businesses to become increasingly interconnected.","Third, we significantly expanded our global platform, both organically and inorganically. Equinix completed 20 major IBX expansions in 2015, creating the needed capacity to support strong fill rates in high demand markets. Overall, our development activity continues to generate highly attractive returns and healthy yield on our sizeable base of stabilized assets.","With the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we further expanded Platform Equinix, which now spans 145 data centers across 40 metros in 21 countries. Combined, Equinix now operates over 14 million gross square feet of colocation space, enhancing our position as the largest retail data center footprint in the world.","Fourth, we continue to establish Equinix as the home of the interconnected cloud, which in turn, is attracting enterprises that are adopting hybrid and multi-cloud as their IT architecture of choice. Key cloud customers including Amazon, Cisco, IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle to mention a few, are all using Equinix to scale their infrastructure globally and are now deployed across an average of 17 markets.","And finally, we successfully completed our first year operating as a REIT and returned $394 million back to our shareholders. We were included in the S&P 500, the MSCI RMZ and the FTSE NAREIT indices, a reflection of our position as both a technology leader and as the largest data center REIT. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet raising $2.6 billion in debt and equity in the fourth quarter fortifying our capital structure while providing a strong liquidity position.","Now turning to the quarter, we had a great finish to the year delivering record bookings in the fourth quarter with particular strength in the Americas and robust metrics including our highest ever interconnection activity, and very firm yield per cabinet. We continue to take market share, capturing outsized portion of the new infrastructure deployments from both clouds and enterprises.","The quality and scale of our wins continues to increase and we are proud that over 140 of the Fortune 500 are Equinix customers. Our geographic reach remains critical to customers with over 55% of our revenue coming from customers deployed globally across all three regions, and over 84% from customers deployed across multiple metros.","Our global platform is increasingly defensible, durable and hard to replicate with regards to reaching capacity as well as performance. With the addition of the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we added 40 data centers and 1,100 people across Europe and Japan. This scale positions us well to build market leadership, increase capacity, enhance cloud and network density and grow customer ecosystems for years to come. With Telecity, we've added seven new metro markets to our portfolio creating a large opportunity for current Equinix customers to expand further north and east across EMEA.","Additionally, there are over 500 customers of former Telecity that have business presence in another country where Platform Equinix resides, creating a potential for powerful cross-selling opportunities as we integrate. We are confident both these transactions will drive significant long-term value creation for our customers and our partners.","Now let me cover quarterly highlights from our industry verticals, starting with the network vertical. This customer base customer continues to grow as we enhance ecosystems in which networks and mobile providers can participate and grow their businesses. Strong global bandwidth demand is driving a resurgence of subsea cable projects, creating new opportunities for Equinix. These service providers are accelerating returns by terminating cables directly into our IBXs where they can further benefit by gaining access to key business ecosystems.","In the content and digital media vertical, content customers are expanding across our global platform to meet the continued explosion of consumer demand for digital content and applications. The advertising sub segment remains the fastest growth driver in this vertical as digital advertising takes share from traditional channels. Customers expanding this quarter include AppNexus which optimizes programmatic digital advertising; AudienceScience, a global advertising technology and services company; and Cr\u00e9teil, a French company specializing in performance marketing.","Turning to the financial services vertical, in addition to our strong electronic trading ecosystem, we continue to diversify across sub-segments including insurance, wealth management, and banking which contributed to record bookings for the quarter. New wins include a top 20 private wealth management firm initiating a multi-cloud strategy to speed to market. A Fortune 500 asset management company that is connecting to clouds over our Equinix Cloud Exchange and a partner-led deal with a top 10 insurance firm based in Europe.","In cloud and IT services, the cloud ecosystem delivered strong growth this quarter driven by key infrastructure-as-a-service providers such as AWS and Microsoft, as well as momentum with Software-as-a-Service providers who represent the fastest growing sub-segment of this vertical. SaaS customer expansions include ServiceNow, an IT service management provider; and Shape Security, an advanced application defense provider that offer security services for Cloud Exchange clients. We continue to see momentum on our Cloud Exchange and have over 300 enterprises, clouds, IT service providers, and networks interconnecting using this solution.","Turning to the enterprise. The enterprise vertical delivered strong bookings as businesses seek to re-architect IT to adapt to rapidly changing business requirements. By leveraging an interconnection-oriented architecture, enterprises can address multiple IT challenges and solve for the cost, scaling and performance needs of today's digital world.","For the second quarter, enterprise was the largest source of new customer adds with particular traction in manufacturing and professional services. New wins include Polo Ralph Laurent, a premium clothing and lifestyle brand; Granite Construction, an S&P 500 civil general contractor and construction material producer; and Oriflame Cosmetics, a Swedish cosmetic manufacturer.","Over 300 customers have deployed our Performance Hub solution, which is an extremely attractive entry point for enterprise customers who seek to optimize network architectures, and also access the cloud and drive application performance, and we are already enjoying significant upsell and cross-sell traction with these customers.","So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to cover some more specifics for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let me start by saying from so many points of view, Q4 was the best quarter we have experienced to date. The momentum in our organic business combined with Telecity and Bit-isle sets us up nicely for 2016, as well as our initial look-through into 2017. And with my prepared remarks I'll first review our full year 2015 results. Then I'll provide some commentary on key metrics for 2016 which have a number of moving parts. Finally I'll wrap up with some high level comments on the fourth quarter.","So, starting with revenues. We reported revenues of over $2.72 billion for 2015, a 16% year-over-year normalized and constant currency growth rate. A clear demonstration of our ability to drive outsized growth as we benefit from the scale of our global platform, as well as enjoy record non-recurring revenue activity. And we believe this momentum will continue into 2016. We expect to deliver normalized and constant currency growth of greater than 13% for our organic business and over $540 million of revenues from Telecity and Bit-isle at current exchange rates.","We believe the Telecity business, net of the expected divestitures, will grow revenues between 8% and 9% in 2016, while Bit-isle's revenues will remain essentially flat year-over-year consistent with our expectations while we look to optimize this business over the next 24 months. In 2015, we improved our organic adjusted EBITDA margin by over 100 basis points to 46.7%. And as we continue to scale the business, we expect to deliver another 100 basis points of improvement on the organic business in 2016 as we maintain discipline and focus on our spending initiatives.","Another key driver to our continued margin improvement is the healthy price yield derived from a disciplined pricing initiative and strong interconnection activity. For 2016, we expect our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins to be greater than 47.3%, excluding integration costs, or 45.6% on an as-reported basis.","Our 2015 pro forma AFFO, which excludes the impact of the Telecity FX losses and the integration cost, was $905 million significantly higher than expected for the year. Looking forward on a normalized and constant currency basis, 2016 AFFO is expected to grow greater than 23% over the prior year. With respect to the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we're very excited by these acquisitions and the ability to strengthen our market position. That said, I want to highlight a few areas recognizing we'll be incurring some costs that won't be part of the ongoing business, thereby allowing you to better understand the combined business on a go-forward basis.","So let me start with FX. We elected to hedge the cash portion of the Telecity purchase price. In effect, we lock-in the dollar value of the sizable deal. This resulted in an FX loss of $61 million in 2015, with $49 million of the loss being recognized in Q4. These losses impacted our AFFO metric for both Q3 and Q4, and for the year. For Q1, as we completed the purchase of the Telecity acquisition, we experience an incremental $50 million loss in the quarter. Again, this loss will impact our Q1 and 2016 AFFO metric.","Finally, it's important to note that the offset of the Telecity FX losses is a corresponding reduction to the purchase price of Telecity. For both Telecity and Bit-isle, we've begun the integration process to combine the teams, the organizations, and the systems together. We expect to incur $58 million in integration cost in 2016 as anticipated in our investment models with an approximate $20 million of additional integration costs being spent in 2017. These costs support system to work, of significance, employees cost including severance and retention, and substantial organizational restructuring in support of our REIT and other tax initiatives.","We expect incremental revenue, cost and CapEx synergies from the acquisitions from Telecity and Bit-isle as we integrate these businesses. Our current revenue guidance contemplates modest revenue synergy assumptions this year, which we expect to ramp up over time as both Equinix and Telecity customers leverage the expanded footprint, service portfolio, and rich ecosystems of the combined company. As we progress with our integration efforts, we also expect to achieve $30 million in annual cost savings with about 50% of these savings being realized before the end of this year and the rest coming in 2017.","For CapEx synergies, the available Bit-isle inventory has positioned us well in the Tokyo market, allowing us to defer significant capital spend to other projects, while the Telecity capacity in our overlapping markets allows us to free up capital to be deployed in other markets both in Europe and across the platform. And as previously announced, we need to divest eight assets from the combined Equinix-Telecity EMEA business with a target divestiture date of mid-2016. In light of the current momentum in the business and the size of the market opportunity in front of us, it is our intention to reinvest the divestiture proceeds back into the business. We currently believe this is the highest and best use of our capital.","We believe this allows us to maximize both our short-term and longer-term shareholder value objectives while providing us the strategic and operational flexibility we've historically enjoyed, particularly during the volatile times. And these proceeds along with capital raised in November should allow us to self-fund the business for the foreseeable future despite our increased expansion activities and anticipated growing cash dividend.","From an AFFO perspective, the value of these acquisitions and our AFFO generating potential is better than our original assumptions. With a view towards 2017, we expect these acquisitions on a combined basis to be accretive to Equinix's AFFO per share for the 2017 reporting year excluding the integration costs.","So turning to the fourth quarter, it was another terrific quarter at Equinix. Our strategy continues to deliver better than expected results across the company. At the global level, we had record gross and net bookings with particular strength in the financial services and enterprise verticals. Our interconnection metrics were again outstanding as we added 7,500 cross connects and 162 exchange for this quarter.","Our MRR per cab on FX-neutral basis was very firm and we remain well-positioned across each of our operating regions. As depicted on slide four, global Q4 revenues were $730.5 million; our 52nd consecutive quarter of top-line revenue growth, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 17% of the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our as-reported revenues include $21.6 million of Bit-isle revenue for November and December, consistent with our expectations and the investment model.","Q4 organic revenues net of our FX hedges absorbs an $8 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter, and a $4 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. Currency volatility against the majority of our key operating currencies continue to cause significant FX headwinds. For 2016, the strengthening in U.S. dollar increased a $51 million FX headwind against revenues and a $29 million headwind against adjusted EBITDA for our organic business when compared to the average FX rates used in 2015.","For Europe, we've hedged over 85% of our Equinix organic business. Given the growth of the international businesses including Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we expect our revenue mix to shift such that greater than 50% of our revenues will be generated from outside the U.S. Global adjusted EBITDA was $333.1 million, up 4% over the prior quarter and 20% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis.","Our normalized adjusted EBITDA margin was 46.4% and includes $2.8 million in integration costs. Our Q4 organic adjusted EBITDA performance net of our FX hedges reflects a negative $5.4 million currency impact when compared to the average FX rates last quarter, and a $1.2 million negative impact when compared to our guidance rates. Global AFFO was $178 million. Excluding the Telecity foreign currency loss and acquisition related cost, AFFO on a normalized and constant currency basis increased 4% over the prior quarter, above the top end of our guidance range by $13 million largely due to lower than expected cash taxes.","And finally moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q4 was 2.3% consistent with our prior guidance and weighted towards the end of the quarter. For 2016, we expect our quarterly MRR churn to remain in our targeted 2% to 2.5% quarterly range. Now, I'd like to provide some highlights on the regions whose full results were covered in slides five to seven. All three regions delivered better than expected revenues with EMEA and Asia Pacific showing normalizing constant currency growth of 20% and 25% respectively, while the Americas region produced growth of 13% on its much larger base. The Americas region had a great quarter delivering record bookings driven by the financial and enterprise verticals, very firm yield per cabinet, and advanced interconnection quarter of all time.","EMEA delivered another strong quarter of bookings with particular strength in our French and German markets, while Asia Pacific continued its rapid growth as customers deploy across the region with gross bookings driven by cloud and IT services, enterprise, and network verticals. Interconnection revenues continue to outpace overall growth of the business with the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific interconnection revenues now at 22%, 10%, and 13% respectively over the recurring revenues.","And now, looking to balance sheet, please refer to slide eight. Unrestricted cash and investments increased this quarter to $2.2 billion due to the successful financings in November, while our restricted cash balances totaled $490 million, largely due to the escrow funds related to the Telecity deal. Our year-end net debt leverage ratio was 3.2 times our Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA, although it steps up to greater than 4 times after funding the cash portion of the Telecity transaction. Given the favorable cash flow attributes of the business model, we expect the Equinix calculated leverage ratio to return to the higher end of our targeted 3 times to 4 times adjusted EBITDA over the next 12 months to 18 months.","Now, switching to AFFO and dividends on slide nine. For 2016, we expect our as-reported AFFO to be greater than $970 million, a 17% year-over-year increase. On a normalized and constant currency basis, AFFO would be greater than $1.078 billion, or a 23% increase over the prior year. Turning to dividends. Today, we announced our Q1 dividend of $1.75 a share, a 3.6% increase over the prior cash dividend per share. For 2016, our projected total cash dividends to be paid will increase approximately $500 million, a 27% increase over the prior year. Our normalized AFFO payout ratio will approximate 52% in 2016. Our estimated share count for 2016 approximate 70.5 million shares including 6.9 million shares issued to Telecity shareholders, and 1.96 million shares expected to be issued in June 2016 to our convertible debt holders.","We continue to believe that both organic and inorganic growth will be the primary ingredient for a steadily growing cash dividend, and we've maintained the flexibility to move additional entities from the taxable restructure to the qualified restructure over time. Now, looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 10. For the quarter, our capital expenditures were $281 million including recurring CapEx of $45 million, slightly higher than guidance due to the timing of cash payments to our contractors. We now have 14 announced expansion projects underway. For 2016, we expect 95% of expansion capital to be allocated to campus or existing market builds and 5% for new market development.","Given the strong performance in our key markets, we expect to move forward with additional expansion phases in Ashburn, Frankfort, Hong Kong, Silicon Valley, and a new flagship build in the Amsterdam Science Park, an interconnection hub. Also given our high utilization rate of 81% and increasing, as well as strong development returns, we expect 2016 CapEx to range between $900 million and $1 billion, which contemplates several new first-phase IBX build on our core Equinox owned campuses, including Ashburn and Silicon Valley, as well as a number of non-U.S. campuses.","And finally, we've provided you a number of slides to bridge the normalized 2015 performance to our 2016 guidance, including slides for revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Please refer to slides 13 to 17. These slides also include the contributions from Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions. Steve?","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Okay. Thanks, Keith. Let me now cover our 2016 strategy on slide 12. Our strategic priorities remains centered on driving growth by pressing our competitive advantage and investing to capture significant opportunities such as the cloud-enabled enterprise. We will allocate capital towards these high-value opportunities and internal strength in our economic model. In the near term, we will focus our energy on successfully integrating Telecity and Bit-isle and growing our market leadership globally. Organically our efforts will be focused on capturing the enterprise through a series of initiatives to build cloud density, create and deploy innovative product solutions, generate demand in targeted segments, and provide professional services focused on enabling the adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud.","We will also continue to ramp our channel program to enhance our reach into the enterprise through agents, resellers, systems integrators and key platform partners. Over the longer term, interconnection will continue to be the essence of our advantage, and Equinix is well-positioned to become the intersection point between the Internet of Things, clouds, networks and the enterprises. We are making meaningful investments to foster new ecosystems to capture this opportunity. And we'll continue to invest in scaling our systems and processes and evolving our capabilities in response to these customer needs. Based on what we see in the market and the steps we are taking at Equinix to capitalize on these opportunities, I continue to be very optimistic about our future.","And the last on slide 18, which summarizes our Q1 and full-year 2016 guidance including FX impacts. Let me cover a few thoughts on our 2016 outlook. First, we continue to deliver another solid year of growth. For the full year of 2016, we expect revenues to be greater than $3.55 billion, a 30% growth on an as-reported basis, or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of greater than 13% year-over-year. Second, our organic adjusted EBITDA margin continues to improve as we drive increased efficiency into the business and scale our operating model. For 2016, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be greater than $1.62 billion or 16% year-over-year growth on a normalized and constant currency basis. This includes a 100-basis point adjusted EBITDA margin improvement for the Equinix Organic business.","And the growth of our business is driving increased adjusted funds from operations, and ultimately, cash flow and dividends. AFFO normalized for the Telecity transaction related FX loss is expected to be greater than $1.078 billion, a 23% growth year-over-year, demonstrating the health of the business model. And finally given our strong pipeline, firm yields and healthy returns, we continue to invest in our business and expect 2016 capital expenditures to range between $900 million and $1 billion for the year. So in closing, the strength of our business is translating into solid revenue growth, firm yield and healthy margins, all of which combine to give us the financial fire power to continue to invest in our global platform and develop innovative solutions. Our fundamental growth continues to drive significant value creation for our shareholders, a reflection of the important role that we play in a rapidly evolving digital economy.","So let me stop here, and I'll turn it over to you, Sam, to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you for all the additional detail and taking the questions. I guess, Steve, if I could, I'd love to review a couple of the sort of big ticket items that you guys brought to the conversation last quarter, and see if we can get an update on them. And I guess the three things that really stand out are; last quarter you talked about a second consecutive quarter of positive pricing actions; you talked about an accelerating TAM; and you talked about the beginning of the emergence of cloud-driven enterprise demand. And while you highlighted enterprise amongst the verticals that were strong, I'd certainly love to hear anything explicit as it applies to sort of, again, cloud-driven enterprise demand. So just if you could sort of review us on those three points. Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Sure. Why don't I just start with a couple of comments, and Charles and Keith can chime in here. Those are three good questions, Jonathan. The pricing actions continue to be favorable to us as we renew and move forward with existing customers that are extending in multiple markets with us. So we're staying very disciplined with our activities and our actions and our deal reviews with our customers as they continue to grow into the global platform.","And so that's showing up every quarter, and I would just tell you that's tied to the discipline of our deal reviews and how we manage that, and Charles can talk about that in a second because he sits on top of those. The accelerating TAM, generally, is because we're prosecuting a dozen-plus other industry verticals that we refer to as the enterprise outside of our core five industry verticals that we've been focused on. And it goes to this hundreds of thousands of customers, prospects, I should say, that we are knocking on their door now via the channel or via the direct sales engine to talk to them about helping them enable them to get to the multi-cloud and get to the Hybrid Cloud environment.","So the cloud enterprise, the simple answer, the reason why we're a cloud enabling these data centers, is to replicate the network density that we achieved the first 16 years, 17 years of this company to make it easy for any CIO of an enterprise, to look inside these facilities and see that they can publically, privately move their traffic, certain applications that are mission critical, revenue facing, customer-focused applications that they can get them to the multi-cloud and get them to take advantage of the performance, the costs, and the IT transformation that's taking place. So we're seeing uplift across all three of these things generally because of the uptake in cloud. And cloud is driving most of this. Charles, why don't you add a little bit of color here?","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Again, all three of these things continue \u2013 we continue positive pricing actions. And as Steve said that's showing up in our yield continuing to be very firm across the board in terms of MRR per cab. The accelerating TAM is really absolutely linked to this enterprise phenomenon, and the building and the scaling of the cloud ecosystem both the cloud density, CSP side of that ecosystem, as well as the enterprise, and I think we've had \u2013 continue to have a number of big lighthouse wins.","And what I would tell you is that I think this is probably the eighth consecutive quarter that both cloud and enterprise has over indexed on a bookings basis relatively to their installed base. Meaning, that those who were continuing to see an evolution of the business, not because our mature ecosystems are waning, but rather because we're seeing an acceleration in the cloud ecosystem.","And this big addressable is really an artifact of people migrating to the cloud, adopting public cloud, using Equinix as a private access option to the public cloud, and really enabling \u2013 really selecting multi-cloud, Hybrid Cloud as the IT architecture of choice. And I think if you look at our core metrics, the business is really hitting on all cylinders against all three of those factors.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC","Great. I'll circle back.","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. And out next question is from Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Your line is now open.","Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about the external growth opportunity that you're seeing? Obviously, there's a lot of chatter about the telco data center divestures out there. And how you see your appetite for acquisitions, and whether you would consider different structures such as JVs and the like if the opportunity arises, and kind of how you might see that play out in 2016?","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Guys, do you want me to start or do you want me...","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Go ahead.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Paul, this is Steve. Why don't I take that and let Keith and Charles add to what thoughts they may have here. So, mostly all of you should be aware that publicly there are a couple of big telcos that are interested and trying to divest some assets, and these are both the big telcos that acquired cloud companies three years, four years, five years ago, and it includes those cloud data centers. It's public, they're positioning them, they're talking to several people. We are one of them. And our position is there are certain assets in those portfolios that we would be interested in, obviously, where there's cloud network density and the power and location, but there's many of those assets that wouldn't make any sense for us. So we're in the early stages, exploratory stages talking to these companies. Those are the two that are public. There's other conversations going on.","There's plenty of companies that are interested in getting out of the data center business. So it's a very active market on top of the divestiture that Keith mentioned that we're doing in Europe. So there's a lot of activity, mostly pressured and driven by the big infrastructure-as-of-service companies who are going as fast as they are, AWS, Microsoft, Google, et cetera, and they're putting a lot of pressure on companies that decided to get into the infrastructure-as-of-service business, and now they're deciding to get out of it, and their data centers are going with it. The telco is probably aimed \u2013 most of the cash that we collect on these will be aimed at, as you all know, aimed at spectrum and aimed at their mobile initiatives, and so it makes sense why they're looking at these. But as I said, there are specific assets that would make sense to us, but it's very early days in the dialog. Charles, I don't know what else you'd add, you're in the middle of...","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Well, I guess, I think you covered most of it. The only one point you've talked about in there, Paul, that might be worth touching on is whether we would consider JVs or other creative commercial structures. I would say that, I think to the extent that there were structures that would allow us to potentially gain access to the assets that we see as most accretive to our strategy, and on point from a capital allocation standpoint for us, we would entertain those.","But I think there are only a very select set of assets that really support our interconnection-rich ecosystem-based strategy, and so we would be focused on those, most likely. And I think that to the extent we could be \u2013 there are other creative ways to get that to happen, we would consider those. But we also have a lot to say grace over right now in terms of getting the integrations done, and so we want to remain very focused on executing the business.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","The only thing I'd add, Paul \u2013 this is Steve, just one last comment is, we'll remain proactive but highly selective in any potential M&A for this type of discussion. And as Charles said, it would have to pass through the filters. It would extend our global platform. It would help enhance our interconnection or our network density. It would help us capture the cloud enterprise discussion that we're having. If it passes those filters, we're going to take a close look at it.","Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. I mean, in Telecity's case, obviously, there's some non-core assets that you're planning to divest. But I guess, in this case would it be fair to say that just because of the scale of what you would classify as non-core, that taking on major portfolios where a majority or a big chunk of the assets are, have to be pegged for sale is not kind of what you're looking for?","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Paul, what I'd like to first say is that, unfortunately, the assets that we're selling they're not non-core. They're effectively mandated through our work with the European regulatory authority. Clearly, to us, we would love to keep all of the assets in our portfolio. But that all said, it goes back to what Charles and Steve alluded to. To the extent that we can acquire assets that are accretive to our overall strategy and they create value for our shareholders, those acquisitions or joint ventures, we absolutely will pursue them. But we are very much focused on, as Steve alluded to, driving investment decisions that support our cloud-enabled strategy, extend our global reach, and enhance our interconnection activities.","Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research. Your line is now open.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Just wondering if you'd give us a bit more of a look into the integration process for the two acquisitions that you've completed, and what are the major milestones that investors should be watching over. Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","I think we're going to have, Michael, Charles and I will take this one. Let me first start with Bit-isle because I think that's an important one, then Charles perhaps, you can take the Telecity one. I think what's really important to understand about Bit-isle, as we said in our prepared remarks, revenues are essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. And I want certain investors to realize, certainly from a margin perspective, Bit-isle is dilutive to our margins today. It is very clear to us given the inventory capacity they have in the Tokyo market specifically. This was an asset that we bought for sub-10 multiple to EBITDA. We believe upon filling up our assets, we're going to be able to enjoy the ability to fill up their assets over a period of time, while at the same time assessing, if you will, the strategic landscape of the number of operating units that Bit-isle had.","And so as a company, we fully intend over a reasonable period of time, it will not be over an 18-month or 24-month period. But probably over the next three years to four years that we would be able to capture all the value associated with the Bit-isle acquisition, fill up their assets and get their margins up to, basically, where our Asia Pacific business is running today, which is in the 45% to 50% EBITDA margin basis. But we're being very disciplined about this acquisition.","Culturally, it's a meaningful acquisition for us, and we're very sensitive to the environment that we're operating in. But we recognize in the investment decision, that over the short-term we weren't going to see any meaningful uplift in the business model and all this will be accretive from day one because we use debt to buy the asset. We're going to be very methodical about how we drive value into that acquisition.","Charles, you want to...?","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. In terms of process, Mike, I guess I'd make a couple of comments. I think that these are obviously both somewhat localized assets with Telecity being a strictly European platform and Bit-isle really being contained to Japan. So our local teams, both in EMEA region and in Japan, have primary responsibility for driving the integration efforts.","That said, we did take an individual from my team who really has been my right hand for quite a while when I ran the Americas business and into my role as the COO who really understands our business deeply, has a deep network across the company. We've actually exported him to \u2013 and he's living in Amsterdam now with his family and is leading the integration effort for Telecity and sort of providing overall oversight to our integration activities in terms of aligning them, keeping them consistent in approach, identifying and applying best practices, et cetera. So that's kind of how we're going about it.","In terms of the metrics, I think, to watch, we're obviously watching them very closely and we will update you as appropriate on these, but I think they are; number one, how are we doing on integrating the sales teams and driving the upsell and the cross-sell activities. And that's one we're probably not going to give a ton of granular insight into publicly, but it's not something that we obviously are watching very, very closely and feel very optimistic about.","Secondly, the synergy capture. We talked about what we expect in terms of synergies and we're driving the teams to those expectations to meet or exceed our synergy estimates from an expense synergy standpoint. And then we're aligning our capital planning processes to make sure that we are gaining the CapEx synergies where we can and ensuring that we continue to have the capacity to respond to the fill rates in high demand markets. And then lastly, I think, probably keeping an eye on our progress on the divestiture and again we'll report our progress to you on that as we have it.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from David Barton with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I have to ask kind of banal financial question. I guess, Keith, I think the market expectation was for AFFO number becoming probably $50 million or $60 million north of the $1.078 billion you kind of called out here. I feel like that probably had a lot to do with people not expecting a lot of the assets just being moved into discontinued ops right away. Could you put a AFFO number alongside the $77 million EBITDA number that you pulled out of the guidance for those divested assets so we could kind of look at a pro forma more normalized number? And any other moving parts in that would be great.","And then second, again, along the same lines just to make sure so we're all on the same page. In terms of the share count we want to be using now, so we're looking at an AFFO per share. I think that there's a lot of numbers on, I think, slide 38 in terms of the share count. And if you could kind of tell us \u2013 or page 35 \u2013 which one of these is the one we're supposed to be using to look at valuation? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Okay certainly, David. I think first and foremost, I think the page 35 clearly depicts the share count activity that you should be expecting both as we sit here at the end of 12\/31\/2015 and then certainly what you should expect on a go-forward basis, and so the numbers that I shared with you, roughly 6.9 million shares will be issued to the Telecity shareholders and then 1.96 million shares issued to convertible debt holders.","That all said, I think there's somewhat of \u2013 there appears to be some clarity over what piece the denominator is, which is the share count. And so a lot of the discussion then really has to go into what's sitting up in the numerator. I think the most important thing as you've said I've alluded to David, the divestiture is certainly, it's a meaningful divestiture. There's eight assets as you can see. As reflected in our bridge, you can see there's roughly $70 million of revenue that's been taken out \u2013 sorry, probably $70 million of EBITDA that has been taken out of the analysis and that's on slide 14 for those who are following along.","A lot of that value recognizing, that's coming right out of the AFFO base. There's nothing that that gets dragged along with that recognizing that, of course, there'll be some movement in maybe how we recognize the revenue or the deferred installation, but overall, that's almost a complete drop-through to the AFFO line. And as a result, when we step back and look at how was the business performing relative to our expectations, I think it's really important to note two things. Number one is Equinix proper is driving more margin into the business. Not only did we do it this year, but we're setting ourselves up to do it next year, being 2016. So that 100 basis points of improvement is certainly being realized.","You can see that Telecity is coming in with the RemainCo assets, they're going to have a margin profile that's higher than Equinix proper, and then we're also going to continue to work on synergies in the business. So that's going to get continue to add value to the go-forward valuation.","And then as I said earlier on, Bit-isle, the one piece we recognized that it is relatively flat over a period of time, but we recognized that as we continue to synergize the business as Charles alluded to, and drive up the occupancy of their assets, that's going to drive more value into the top-line. So I think the culmination of those three assets, the organic with the two acquisitions and knowing that we are growing faster certainly than we anticipated in 2015 and we think we've got a great growth rate coming into 2016 at this stage of the game at greater than 13% organically, we're optimistic that the numerator will drive a lot of value into the per share calculations. All that to say is, we got to get through 2016. 2016 is no different than 2015 when we convert it to a REIT. 2016, there's a lot of noise in the system, not only with the reconversion and all the other work that we still are doing, but also taking the Telecity asset and moving them into the structure.","And so the costs to do that are substantial but the benefit that we will realize from the Telecity acquisition that Steve's talked about. There's revenues, there's cost, there's CapEx, but there's also a much more efficient tax structure that we will operate in under our structure, if you will. And all of that benefit you're really going to feel it more in 2017 than you are in 2016. And so you got to look through 2016 to recognize 2017 I think sets itself up well. The currency issues should be gone. The integration cost will really \u2013 we expect them to have really been dialed down and the operating business should be accelerating as we've alluded to.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Okay. Thanks, Keith.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. A couple of quick ones, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the churn expectations. You gave it on a company-wide basis and if there's any regional variation to keep in mind. And then on the interconnects, I just wondered if you could discuss, in a little bit more detail, the growth in interconnect and how much of that is coming from Cloud Exchange versus the conventional cross connect? And then Steve, in response to Jonathan's questions you alluded to the indirect channel and then maybe your or Charles can maybe comment on the portion of new bookings that you had ascribed to are indirect which is a relatively recent initiative of yours? Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","You want to start with churn, Keith?","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","So why don't I take churn and then I'll past it on to Charles and Steve. I think one thing about churn, let me break down between the organic business or Equinix proper. I would tell you our churn levels are at or near their best in a long, long time. That holds true also for 2016. As I mentioned, churn in Q4 was 2.3%. We telegraphed that it would be slightly higher, it was attributed to a single customer in our UK business that we knew that would be relocating to their own specialty-built data center. That said, as we look forward we see churn to be, again, at one of its lowest levels, I think, we've ever experienced as a company organically.","As you then go into the two other assets, the Telecity asset and the Bit-isle asset, Telecity is going to be really no different than what you see at the Equinix level. Where you're going to see slightly increased churn is really in Bit-isle. And a lot of reasons for \u2013 when you look at how Bit-isle did in 2014 relative to 2015 and what we're guiding to 2016, there's a number of factors. Number one, they've got non-recurring activities that will not repeat themselves. They have an operating unit that has \u2013 where they build solar plants, and they've sold off some of those assets. That was sitting in their 2014 results. It's not in 2015.","Equally so, they've suffered some substantial churn. They have done exactly what we choose not to do, which is effectively fill up a large portion of their inventory with some large customers. And when those customers run into trouble, as you can appreciate, then there's a fairly meaningful churn event. That's what Bit-isle is suffering through not only in 2015, and that's why their value is so low, but also we're still going to feel some of that in 2016. And so from my perspective, churn will be, I think, at a very strong level looking into 2016.","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. And I'll hit the other parts. I'll put a point on the churn and just say that, again, what we continue to see is just the discipline in the business and this commitment to the right customers, right applications, right assets continues to manifest itself, both in terms of the positive price actions, and correspondingly to the moderated churn levels. So I think it's absolutely a reflection of the strategy working as we would expect.","The other two topics were interconnection. I would say that interconnection obviously an incredibly strong quarter with 7,500 cross connection aggregate. We track that at a very detailed level vertical, essentially on the from and to by every vertical. And every sell in that matrix is growing. The fastest growing are the cloud-related, sort of the cloud ecosystem on a percentage basis, but the most \u2013 in absolute terms, the biggest contributor continues to be our mature network ecosystem. And the financial services ecosystem continues to contribute significantly, but on a percentage basis, cloud is over-indexing dramatically like 5X probably its installed base, and that's just a reflection of the early days of that and really starting to sort of take shape and scale as enterprises are adapting Hybrid Cloud.","I would also say a part of the driver in the network as on cross connect is these 300 customers that have adapted Performance Hub, many of whom are using that for WAN optimization strategies and therefore are driving significant cross connects to network providers. So that's a snapshot on interconnection.","And then lastly on channel, what I would tell you is that we, over the last couple of quarters, have seen a number of our lighthouse marquee deals in the enterprise come through partners. And I think that's a reflection of that many of those customers are finding that they need some combination of the infrastructure value delivered by Platform Equinix but desire a managed service element of that implementation and our partners are doing that very effectively. And so, we won some very big deals as we referenced in the script from true partners with our enterprise lighthouse wins. And we are seeing in terms of allocation of the percentage of bookings coming through indirect, continue to grow steadily and we're really focusing on a set of high impact partners that we think will help us continue to drive that through 2016.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much. You've talked a lot about the various regions and you really haven't brought up macro at all. We look at the market performance, we look at the headlines, and it really doesn't seem like \u2013 it's pretty tough out there particularly in some of the international markets. So, are you seeing anything from your customers or are the secular trends still very healthy at this point? And perhaps you could just give us a little bit more color on the sale process. I think you had said mid-year, what gives you confidence that it'll all be wrapped up by then. And are you likely to do one transaction or might this be multiple transactions? Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Hey, Simon, this is Steve. I'll start out and then we'll triple team it here.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","In terms of the market's macro trends, I think we all saw IDC or Gartner tell us that the IT spend globally was slowing down at the end of last year. I think this goes back to what Charles said. Because we're so focused on the type of application workload with our client base that is not considered discretionary and it's more mission-critical, even in volatile times, as Keith alluded to, we tend to perform better than the market because we are dealing with revenue, customer-facing, globally deployed type application workloads that are critical to run these businesses.","So, because of our discipline and executing in that part of the application workload of our customer base, and that part of the \u2013 that's non-back office, non-server farm type workload, we tend to push right through this. And the demand that we see from our customer base today is high, trying to figure out how to take advantage of the cloud computing model.","And so our pipeline, if you were able to see into our pipeline, which you guys can't, you would see very good coverage ratios and you would see the strongest pipeline in the history of the company. So the signals for us across all the regions emanate themselves in our pipeline and emanate themselves in our coverage ratios, and all I can tell you at this point is they are strong as they've ever been.","And Charles I don't know what you would add to that.","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I guess just countering the macro IT spending environment, which is \u2013 I mean that environment is being impacted heavily by public cloud adoption and adoption of hybrid cloud, multi-cloud as the architecture of choice. And so if you really look at the portion that we tend to play in and around, if you look at the growth of AWS, look at Microsoft's Azure revenues and their cloud participation, look at what Oracle is doing in terms of retooling their business into the cloud, those are all significant customers of ours. They're all scaling globally with us. And then we are really leveraging that cloud density with that sort of core group, as well as a very long tail of SaaS to really attract the enterprise customer and seeing some momentum there.","And it is an environment. Although there's market volatility and pressure, I think, on CIOs to manage spending and reduce expense, et cetera, they're often coming to us as a way to achieve those means. And whether that's reducing network cost, adopting public cloud at an accelerated rate or implementing hybrid cloud and moving it out of their basement and avoiding spending that capital. Those are all things that they can really use us for. So we feel well-positioned even though there's some choppiness in the overall macro environment.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That makes sense.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","So, concluding your final question, Simon, was really about the timing of the asset divestiture in Europe. Clearly, there's an expectation as we worked alongside the EU regulators and Telecity, that we'd sell the assets over a certain period of time. That timeframe would be in or around the midyear 2016. As Steve alluded to, we're very \u2013 well down the process, if you will, at selling the assets. We have a number of interested buyers. And I think you just have to stay tuned, but we're very active and deep in the process right now and we're confident that we will conclude it before or near midyear.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks. Steve, maybe just a follow-up on the undersea piece, sounds like you guys are pretty excited about it. With respect to the sort of types of traffic and the government regulation, are you guys set up better to address that marketplace based upon the geographic locations of your data centers? And then just secondly, maybe one for Keith, you identified some cost savings that are organic. Just trying to get a sense for a little more detail around where you're finding that.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Sure. Let me take the first piece, Mike. There are a lot of new projects, mostly driven by the requirements to help support all this global cloud deployment that's going on around the world in the growth of international traffic. So there really hasn't been any new Transatlantic capacity been added in the last probably dozen years until one of the announcements that came late last year or middle of last year, Hibernia Express which went live at Equinix. So there's a lot of focus out there, some private investment, partially funded by some of the big global \u2013 the global cloud providers.","It's definitely being driven by cloud. We're involved in many more conversations than we ever have in the future \u2013 or in the past, I should say. And the advancements in technology today is allowing these operators to bypass the traditional shore-based lending facilities and go all the way to terminating at a data center like Equinix. So we're capturing that volume now. And there's been four to five public announcements that we've made of ones that we've participated in. There's been a couple that had connected U.S., Japan, New York, London and so there's a whole bunch growing on now. We're probably involved in a dozen more projects today that are at different stages of assessment, development and construction. So it is very active. It is driven by the cloud and by the bandwidth, amount of traffic around the world, and they can terminate these cables today very easily into data centers. And so we're front and center on this topic.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Steve, how's the contract working. Are you directly dealing with undersea folks or is it the end user customers?","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","I think it's the undersea folks. Isn't it, Charles?","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Typically, the providers or a consortium of folks that are involved.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","For the consortium, yeah.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","And then as it relates to basically the question of cost savings, I think what's most important to note Mike is, we're going in and cutting costs. What we're doing today is we're operating more efficiently. And it's important to recognize over the last three to four years, we've made heavy investments across a number of different functional groups to scale the organization to be global, and one of the biggest investments we've made has been in our IT systems and platforms and the people that really continue to work very hard to make them run as efficiently as possible and then we build our processes and structures around them.","That said, we've made those initial investments. We've been investing in sale and sort of in customer-facing initiatives which, I would argue, is driving a lot of the value that we see today. We're also finding ways to reallocate our costs. And part of our efforts today, not only as it related to 2015, but also as we look to 2016 is how do we run more efficiently and take resources that we're spending money in, run them more efficiently so we can put it back into the business differently.","And in fact, there's roughly $24 million of costs that we reallocated in our organization to support our investments in 2016. And so we feel very comfortable about that. But quite frankly, it's a work in progress. We have to continue to lever off our systems, our processes and our people and that's something that you'll see in 2016, but you're also going to see us globalize as we bring in Telecity and we bring in Bit-isle over the next \u2013 through 2017, 2018 and 2019. We'll continue to make these investments that I would argue that can drive more value into the business.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is from Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. I guess at the risk of Katrina not letting me back on the call again, I'm going to have three questions, but they're all modeling so hopefully you guys can bang out them pretty quickly. The first one is on Telecity. I was curious what tax rate we should be thinking about for 2016? My understanding is that they're still under the UK tax jurisdiction which is different than how you guys treat your European assets. And when is it that we might actually see Telecity shift from its current tax structure to that of the overall Equinix business?","The second one is on 2017. You mentioned that you thought that Telecity will be accretive to 2017 after integration cost. You mentioned integration cost I think in 2017 will be $20 million. Will it be accretive even including those integration cost? And then the third question is on Telecity and your FX hedge. I think you mentioned that you've hedged about 80% of your core business in Europe. Do you plan on hedging any of the Telecity revenues at some point this year and perhaps how much would those be? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Great questions, Colby. I think first and foremost as it relates to the tax rate, probably a little bit premature for us to tell you what that's going to be, because part of the reason we're making such a substantial investment in integration cost in 2016 is to change the organizational structure to meet not only our REIT requirements but our commissionary requirements.","And so suffice it to say, we feel that overall our global tax rate will continue to be in the 10% to 15% on a cash rate basis. We as a company and certainly our European business pre-organically has a lower tax rate than that of our competitors and so we think we can benefit from that. So, stay tuned on that one. Let us come back but there's a lot of work to deal with there.","As it relates to Telecity on the FX side, I think it's important to note we have hedged 85% of the organic business. We have yet to take a position on the Telecity business in Europe, primarily because their functional currency is not U.S. dollar. Our functional currency in Europe is U.S. dollar. And so the hedging strategies we would deploy are going to be different today, at least, for Equinix proper versus the Telecity assets. But suffice it to say, we're going to be looking very closely and trying not to destroy value with currency movement. So again, stay tuned on that one and I'm sure I have numbers.","The third one was...","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Just 2017 accretion.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. Pardon me. The 2017 \u2013 yeah we \u2013 the combined business including integration is going to be accretive in 2017 relative to I'm not doing these transactions, so we're very \u2013 again we want you to look through 2016 to 2017. With those $20 million of costs, we will be accretive in 2017 on, if you want, a combined basis with their assets.","The one thing I certainly want to make \u2013 I'll leave you with is you have to recognize, by the time we start to go through the year and integrate these assets, as Charles alluded to, the assets are going to become fungible. And so whether we sell into a Telecity asset or a Bit-isle asset or an Equinix organic asset and how we move our people around, that's what we said. We've got to look at it holistically in 2017, recognize there're going to be a lot of moving parts, there's going to be synergies, there's going to be integration costs. So holistically, I want you to walk away 2017 is an accretive year for us and we're very excited to work through this year, and over the next 10 months to get to where we need to be.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co.

Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that some of the statements that we'll be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2016, and 10-Q filed on August 8, 2016.","Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call.

Following our prepared remarks, we'll be take questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We had a great third quarter, delivering record bookings fueled by significant growth in our cloud, financial and enterprise segments. We see a robust pipeline driven by strong global demand from cloud service providers and the broad adoption of hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice.","Today, Platform Equinix offers access to more than 1,400 networks and 2,700 cloud and IT service providers, making us a critical partner for multinational enterprises thinking to re-architect their infrastructure to reduce costs, enhance their flexibility and optimize performance in an increasingly cloud-first world.","As depicted on slide 3, third quarter revenues were $924.7 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 14% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, above the top end of our guidance range.","Adjusted EBITDA was $420 million for the quarter, flat over the prior quarter and up 18% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA absorbs an incremental $5 million of cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity and $2.5 million of integration costs accelerated into Q3. Absent these adjustments, our adjusted EBITDA would have been at $427.5 million above the top end of our guidance range. AFFO grew 44% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis.","We are successfully cultivating and curating our digital ecosystems, which is driving healthy operating metrics across the board including firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and strong interconnection growth. We added 10 Fortune 500 customers this quarter including: Target, a leading retailer; and Aetna, a healthcare and insurance provider, and we now have penetrated nearly one-third of the Fortune 500 and a quarter of the Forbes Global 2000 companies. Our fastest growth continues to come from three region deployments, which now represent 55% of total recurring revenue, highlighting the importance of our global reach.","Across all fronts, we are pleased with the volume, quality and diversity of bookings. We continue to capture critical strategic footprints and are leveraging our scaled global service delivery platform to process more deal flow than any other data center company.","We are pressing our advantage to capture the next wave of demand, enhancing our go-to-market capabilities to win the cloud-enabled enterprise. Many new use cases are driving data center colocation for the foreseeable future, including the Internet of Things, next-generation security services, submarine cables, digital payments, wireless aggregation, as well as compute storage and networking trends. Our differentiation as a company and the mode around our business continues to expand as we penetrate these new markets and grow our global interconnection platform.","I would like to next provide commentary on how our acquisitions, organic development and expanding portfolio of interconnection services are accelerating our market leadership. Starting with interconnection, interconnection revenue grew 19% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. We now have over 188,000 cross connects, and this is the ninth quarter in a row where we added greater than 5,000 cross connects.","We saw strong growth of connections to cloud through both direct cross connects and our Cloud Exchange. Our Internet Exchanges also continue to scale with provision capacity ramping up with 100-gig upgrades, which bodes well for continued traffic growth. Also this quarter, we rolled out our Internet Exchange in Helsinki, based on customer demand in this former Telecity site, expanding coverage of our Internet Exchanges to 19 markets worldwide.","Another interconnection driver is the submarine cable industry, which is experiencing explosive growth driven primarily by exponential increases in data traffic consumed by the large cloud service providers and innovations in optical equipment, with more cable laid in 2016 than over the past five years combined.","As a result, we're seeing significant momentum as their strategic partner in these submarine cable projects, and we have won edge deployments for 12 projects to-date, eight of which are active and four of which are in progress.","Winning these deployments builds on our original vision of Equinix being the intersection point, where all the data bits flow, and these wins will drive even more traffic through our sites, flowing through colocation and interconnection services as networking cloud providers join the ecosystem.","These multi-decade cable projects will help anchor our sites as the key interconnection points around the world and our wins include AquaComms, which runs from New York to London; Southern Cross Cable Network, which runs from California to Sydney; and FASTER, which runs from the West Coast of the United States to Japan.","Our newest win is with Monet, a next-generation cable architecture owned by Google and three telecom providers, connecting the United States to Brazil, where our Miami IBX will service the U.S. cable landing station.","The Monet deployment represents an industry first, deploying a submarine cable architecture together with an integrated cable landing station inside Equinix's network and cloud-dense multi-tenant data centers. This new architecture, which eliminates the need for a separate cable landing station, was developed to meet the needs of large cloud providers for speed, efficiency and open system design.","Turning to acquisitions, we significantly extended our scale and reach with the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions in Europe and Japan, and are progressing well with integrating these two businesses to deliver more value to our customers.","The Telecity business delivered solid financial performance in the quarter and were ahead of plan with our revenue and cost synergy targets, which includes customer cross-selling, while concurrently integrating our product portfolio and our pricing strategy. We are enriching the data center metro connectivity across our combined EMEA footprint, which was recently completed in London and is underway in five other EMEA metros.","We're also pleased with the Bit-isle's progress and saw healthy bookings across the entire Japanese business in the third quarter. We see sustained interest in our expanded Japanese portfolio, and tethering the Equinix and Bit-isle assets together has allowed us to position all of the properties as part of a larger campus ecosystem.","Turning to our organic development activity, we continued to invest and expand globally with 18 announced expansion projects underway. This quarter, we are moving forward with additional expansions in Dallas, Dublin, Frankfurt, Helsinki and Zurich totaling over $100 million of capital expenditures.","We are also progressing with five major new IBX builds in Amsterdam, Ashburn, Frankfurt, S\u00e3o Paulo and Silicon Valley that will give us key capacity to satisfy strong demand and will expand our data center count to over 150 by mid-2017.","In terms of our asset ownership strategy, we continue to acquire and develop land, building major new campuses on owned land in Ashburn, Frankfurt and Silicon Valley. This quarter, we also bought six acres of land next to our Chicago-3 IBX, which we'll develop over time to expand our Chicago Elk Grove campus, which has seen increasing demand from cloud and financial customers. These capital investments are delivering very healthy growth and strong returns as shown on slide 4.","Revenues from our 70 stabilized IBXs grew 6% year-over-year, largely driven by an increase in cross connects and power density. These stabilized assets are generating 32% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, and utilization has stepped up to 87%.","Looking beyond the numbers, customers increasingly care about greening their supply chains, and we are working hard to reduce our environmental and carbon footprint by improving energy efficiency in sourcing of renewable energy. We are building in our position as the leader in our space and continue to make progress towards our long-term goal of 100% clean and renewable energy.","Let me now shift and cover the quarterly highlights from our industry verticals. And I'll start with the networks. This vertical delivered strong bookings, a nice step up in revenues and meaningful new logo adds this quarter. Network service providers, cable operators and satellite providers are growing with Equinix as they shift their portfolios to address the enterprise demand for cloud, mobile and new digital services like the Internet of Things.","Growth this quarter was led by strength in EMEA and Asia as wireline providers augment their infrastructure to support cloud connectivity and deploy new optical technology. Customer expansions included Orange Business Services, a global IT and communications provider, deploying a new cloud offering for enterprises, and Hawaiki submarine cable, a Trans-Pacific cable system between Australia and the United States.","The financial services vertical achieved record bookings with over-indexing growth from the trading, insurance and digital payment segments as we continue to make progress in expanding our relationships far beyond electronic trading. We've seen minimal impact to-date from Brexit in our financial services segment with continued traction across Europe, including near-record bookings for the financial services segment in the UK.","This quarter, we expanded with PayPal, an important customer in the digital payment ecosystem that is interconnecting to business partners to improve performance and latency and helps PayPal maintain seamless transactions through on-demand shopping anywhere in the world.","We also expanded with insurance customers including Lloyd's, who is deploying a cloud-based risk modeling platform for the insurance industry as well as a Fortune 100 insurance firm leveraging connectivity to AWS for big data analytics.","In the content and digital media vertical, advertisers, CDMs and digital media were the growth drivers for bookings, led by the Asia-Pacific region. Customer wins included Abbott Technology (12:10), a leading editing and distribution platform that is deploying Performance Hub to connect remote end users to its product suite via Azure, as well as expansion in the quarter from ChinaCache, Patayo (12:23), Tencent and Yahoo! as they expand their digital edges.","The cloud and IT services vertical had its second best bookings quarter with growth in software-as-a-service and multi-region infrastructure as a service deployments. We continue to enhance our value as the home of the interconnected cloud by increasing cloud density and coverage of software-as-a-service providers and making it easy for enterprises to find and consume a broad range of cloud services.","Our Cloud Exchange saw a strong adoption with solid growth in EMEA, good port orders and ramping traffic driven by over 540 enterprises, clouds and networks, using Cloud Exchange to interconnect. We continue to add cloud service providers across our markets, deepening our strategic footprints with anchors such as AWS, Azure, IBM Softlayer, Google and Oracle, and expanding new availability to specialized cloud services and security, unified communications and enterprise application test and development.","Turning to enterprise, this vertical also saw its second highest bookings quarter, led by the Americas, and captured a record number of new customers with expanding penetration of the Fortune 500.","Wins included a Fortune 250 food manufacturer embracing digital transformation, a top three auto manufacturer optimizing their network topology and connecting to Azure through Cloud Exchange, as well as J.B. Hunt, a Fortune 500 transportation company.","Our Performance Hub solution continues to see strong adoption and more than 560 customers are using this solution to re-architect their infrastructure to directly connect their people, locations, clouds and data.","And finally, we continue to build and enhance our go-to-market engine through both direct and indirect channels. We are improving our market awareness and lead generation capability through targeted programs and seeing strong results in creating a pipeline of highly qualified opportunities.","We are seeing a steady stream of new customer adds, trending between 150 and 200 a quarter, with an increasing share coming from cloud and enterprise. We're also enjoying continued success in channel bookings which account for roughly 15% of total bookings over the past several quarters, with two-thirds of this activity from resellers who are amplifying our market reach and providing our customers with end-to-end solutions.","So, let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Thanks, Steve and good afternoon to everyone on the call. As highlighted by Steve, Q3 was another very strong quarter across virtually all of our key operating metrics. We had record bookings with strong performance across each of the regions as well as our verticals, once again, reflecting the favorable position we enjoy across our marketplace.","We delivered our 55th straight quarter of top line growth, the results of disciplined execution and we experienced another quarter of healthy margin performance resulting in strong flow through to AFFO from the underlying business.","Revenues in AFFO were above our expectations, while adjusted EBITDA was at the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity. Absent these adjustments, our adjusted EBITDA would have been above the top end of our guidance range, consistent with our revenues and our operating performance.","Looking at our other operating metrics, our MRR per cabinet yield continues to remain strong at greater than $2,000 per cabinet. We added 2,200 net billable cabinets and gross cross connect additions were a very positive 6,400 in the quarter. Note that all metrics have been normalized for the sale of our London 2 IBX, which was sold in early July as part of our asset divestiture process related to the Telecity acquisition.","With respect to our acquisitions, Telecity and Bit-isle had their best bookings quarter of the year and we're making solid progress with our integration efforts. We're already enjoying the benefits of a number of cross-sell successes, while the depth of the sales pipeline continues to grow, and we're on track to achieve our targeted cost synergies by the end of 2017. The financial and IT system work is well underway and we've defined the critical initiatives to operationally integrate the back offices over the next 18 months.","Specifically, as it relates to Bit-isle, we've integrated the business faster than originally anticipated, positioning the business to accelerate revenues and increase their operating margin more quickly than planned. We've also been able to sell their non-core assets sooner than expected.","In October, we entered into an agreement to sell Terra Power, the third non-core Bit-isle business line, for approximately $78 million at current exchange rates. These proceeds, once fully received, will effectively reduce our net investment in Bit-isle and should make this transaction one of our best performing M&A transactions from a return perspective. And finally, we've now replaced the temporary Bit-isle bridge facility with a permanent debt facility, with an all-in cost of funds approximating 2%.","Turning to foreign currency, post-Brexit news we saw the weakening of the U.S. pound and the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Since that time, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen against most of our operating currencies, largely due to a view that policymakers will increase interest rates in the U.S. by the end of the year.","Our current FX hedges have proven to be very effective during this volatile period; and as a result, despite some level of impact, we don't anticipate this to be meaningful to our Q4 operating results, largely due to our pound sterling hedges being placed at $1.54 to the pound.","As we look into 2017, we've already hedged over 50% of the EMEA revenues in cash flows, and we expect our hedge position to increase over time as we continue to integrate Telecity entities into the EMEA business.","So turning to the third quarter, as depicted on slide 5, global Q3 revenues were at $924.7 million, above the top end of our guidance range, up 3% over the prior quarter and 14% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, reflecting positive momentum in both MRR and NRR revenue lines.","Our global platform continues to expand in Asia-Pacific and EMEA, showing organic and constant currency growth on the same quarter compared to last year of 19% and 15%, respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 11%. Our as-reported revenues include $147.1 million from our acquisitions, consistent with our expectations.","Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $1.9 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $1.3 million positive currency benefit when compared to our guidance range.","Global adjusted EBITDA was $420 million, flat over the prior quarter and up 18% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis. Our as-reported adjusted EBITDA included $19 million of integration costs. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margins stepped down to 45.4%, lower than the prior quarter.","Relative to our prior guidance, we booked an incremental $5 million of cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity, as we refined our estimates during Q3. These adjustments included conversion of certain leases from capitalized to operating classification, which had minimal net impact to our AFFO metric.","Additionally, we accelerated $2.5 million of Telecity integration costs into Q3. Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges was essentially flat when compared to the average FX rates last quarter and a $700,000 positive benefit when compared to our guidance range.","Global AFFO was $284.2 million, down slightly over the prior quarter. AFFO on a normalized and constant currency basis increased 44% over the prior year.","Moving to churn, global Q3 churn was 2%, consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect MRR churn to remain in our targeted range to 2% to 2.5%.","Turning to 2017, we continue to expect MRR churn to range average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, which includes elevated churn of approximately 3% in Q1 related to the final phase of LinkedIn's bifurcation strategy.","I'd now like to provide a few highlights on the regions with full results covered on slides 6 through 8. The Americas region had its second highest bookings quarter of all time driven by our cloud and financial services verticals with ongoing strong outbound production and healthy yield.","EMEA delivered a record bookings quarter with particular strength in the Dutch and French markets. EMEA continued to execute against its key business initiatives, including the integration of the Telecity business. As a reminder, revenue lost from the London 2 asset sale approximated $3 million for the quarter.","Asia-Pacific remained our fastest-growing region with strong bookings in Hong Kong and Tokyo markets driven by cloud and IT and financial verticals.","Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business with the Americas, APAC and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, 11% and 7%, respectively, of recurring revenues, updated for the sale of our London 2 IBX.","And now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to slide 9. Unrestricted cash and investments increased over $1 billion after taking into consideration the proceeds related to the EMEA asset sale, as well as funds used to purchase our Paris 2 and 3 assets. Our outstanding debt approximates $7 billion, a slight decrease over the prior quarter, primarily due to one of our capital leases converting to an operating lease.","Our debt leverage ratio, net of unrestricted cash, was about 3.6 times, our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Also of note during the quarter, S&P raised our corporate credit rating to BB+. We continue to aspire to be an investment grade-rated company, yet we'll continue to balance that aspiration with our objective to invest our capital with the highest and best-use mindset.","Now switching to AFFO and dividends on slide 10. For 2016, we're raising our as-reported AFFO to now range between $1.059 billion and $1.065 billion, a 28% year-over-year increase, the results of our strong operating performance and lower-than-expected interest and tax expenses. AFFO on a normalized and constant currency basis is now expected to range between $1.182 billion and $1.188 billion, a 35% increase over the prior year.","On a fully diluted share basis using our weighted average 71.7 million common shares outstanding, AFFO per share is expected to be $16.55, a 13% increase over the prior year. Also, today we announced our Q4 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q3 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio is estimated to be approximately 47% for 2016.","Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 11. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $279.5 million, including recurring CapEx of $41.6 million, consistent with our guidance expectations. During the quarter, we opened six new projects across our region at a much-needed capacity, particularly in EMEA, and currently have another 18 projects underway as we continue to see strong development returns across our new expansion and stabilized at IBX projects.","And finally, we provided you a number of slides abridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and the AFFO. Please refer to slides 12 through 15.","I'll now turn the call back to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Keith. And finally, on slide 16, it summarizes our updated Q4 and full-year 2016 guidance, including the impact of FX changes.","Now let me cover our updated 2016 outlook. For the full-year of 2016, we're raising our revenue guidance to now range between $3.609 billion and $3.615 billion, a 33% as-reported growth or organic and constant currency growth of 14.1% compared to the prior year. This updated guidance includes a negative $1 million FX impact when compared to prior guidance range. Net of FX revenue is stepping up $10 million, the result of our strong Q3 operating performance.","For 2016, we are updating our adjusted EBITDA guidance to now range between $1.65 billion and $1.656 billion and organic and constant currency growth of 17% compared to the prior year. This absorbs an incremental $4 million of accelerated integration costs, $10 million of primarily cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity, and minimal FX impact.","We are pleased with the business' adjusted EBITDA performance and expect to continue to drive margin improvement into 2017. And we're raising our AFFO to range between $1.059 billion and $1.065 billion, a 35% normalized and constant currency growth rate compared to the prior year. This $17 million AFFO increase has negligible foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance and the result of strong operating performance and lower interest expense. And finally, we expect our 2016 capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion for the year.","In closing, we are pleased with our progress this year as we continue to successfully integrate our acquisitions, grow our global platform and scale our interconnection services. Our digital ecosystems continue to thrive globally and the adoption of cloud services by enterprises is accelerating, driving new opportunities at Equinix, enhancing our operating metrics and significantly expanding our addressable market. We are focused on scaling and refining our go-to-market engine, directed at capturing the significant shift to the cloud and delivering continued profitable growth.","So, let me stop here and we'll open it up for questions. I'll turn it back over to you, Sean.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question is coming from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open. You may begin.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much, and good afternoon, folks.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Hi, Amir.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was wondering if we could chat a bit more about sort of the enterprise adoption. You folks clearly continue to make progress, and I was wondering if we could dig in a bit here. What specifically are you seeing with respect to deployments? Is there a prospect for accelerating demand? I mean, you've named some fairly notable logos here. It seems as though this sort of land-and-expand strategy has been working in your favor, so I'd love to hear sort of your thought process around enterprise demand, and then I've got a quick follow-up.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Sure, Amir. This is Charles. I think there's definitely a prospect for accelerating demand at some level. We continue to see adoption from the top of the enterprise pyramid, in terms of people adopting hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice, and really hybrid cloud\/multi-cloud, I think that's an important distinction.","We're seeing them really embrace public cloud as a way to variabilize their cost structure and gain flexibility, but then also implementing hybrid cloud architectures that allow them to implement certain elements of private infrastructure where they see that as necessary and important from a performance and security standpoint.","So, we've had great success with our Performance Hub product, which I think people are using for a number of use cases including WAN optimization as well as implementing the multi-cloud. And I think that we're continuing to see them really, really exercise that as the architecture of choice at the top of the pyramid.","And I think what that's starting to do is roll down into their broader enterprise market opportunity as well, and we see that showing up in our channel, in particular, because our channel partners are now bringing a series of value-added services to perhaps smaller enterprise customers that are also viewing to adopt. So, yeah, we definitely see continued momentum and I think strong prospects going forward.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, the other thing I'd add, Charles, is one of the data points I think we picked up in the quarterly reviews was, I think some 60 logos to 70 logos, I think the 65 new logos came from the channel that were enterprise-oriented, so the indirect activity that Charles pointed to is really starting to show up with our partners who are bringing full solutions to the enterprises with Equinix as part of that solution. So, it's pretty exciting, we're starting to see this really ramp as we predicted.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much. And then if I may, on the M&A front, it does seem like some of the assets that have been in the market for some time are closer to a successful sale based on, if you listen to what the folks who own those assets have been saying more recently. Any thoughts on \u2013 that you might be able to share on their relative attractiveness, whether there has been a willingness to separate the desirable assets versus the less desirable assets under their ownership? I know you guys have a lot on your plate at the moment with integration, but would love to hear your thoughts there.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. Let me \u2013 this is Steve. Let me start out there and maybe Charles or Keith would have something to add here. But I would tell you that we remain as we have in the past, very proactive and highly selective on any potential M&A here. We typically look at three critical factors when we look at any type of inorganic activity.","One, does it scale our platform globally and give us more diversity of customers? Two, does the transaction enhance our interconnection and\/or network density? And then three, does it help us capture the cloud enterprise activity that Charles just talked about? So, we're always looking for assets that fit those criteria, and I think you should expect us to continue to be thoughtful about creating shareholder value and extending this leadership platform that we refer to as Platform Equinix.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Steve, Charles.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Amir.","Operator","Thank you, sir. The next question on queue is coming from the line of Mr. Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open. You may begin.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. I wonder if we could start by talking about the progress on Telecity given the commentary on acceleration of integration. Where are you on integrating that into Equinix systems and getting those back to the company level of growth?","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Sure. Well, let me take the first part of your question, Phil. As it relates to the integration into our systems, a week ago, Monday, we actually finally rolled in UK business in \u2013 onto our operating platform, so now we have both the Dutch and the UK business into our eco-platform, which is basically how we continue to scale the business.","Next will be Ireland and Sweden, they're already in the REIT structure, and once we get those two onto the operating platform, 70% of the revenues will be covered inside our platform.","I think the most important thing to note is, as we acquire, whether it's Telecity or any business, the most important part is getting to the data and understanding what insight we can draw from that data, and so we're working very hard and diligently right now to not only grab the data, get it into our systems, process it, understand it and then execute against it. So that's where we are from an integration perspective.","Suffice it to say, when you look at the overall business, as a company we said, look, we'll take revenues up slightly when we look to bid down Telecity on a combined basis. When we look at EBITDA, we're going to take it down roughly $5 million; but as you're aware, there's $10 million of accounting adjustments that are taking place this quarter, which are predominantly non-cash U.S. GAAP adjustments, conform their results into our results.","So the business is performing as we anticipate. I think the next step really is, though, to leverage off what we said earlier on, which is continuing to enjoy the benefits of cross-sell and execute against our platform, yet at the same time make sure that we have sufficient inventory in the marketplace to support that.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. The other comment I guess I'd make is relative to \u2013 one of the critical pieces of how we view the integration and traction there is cross selling and how well we're doing in terms of cross selling, upselling, across the platforms. And I think we're actually well ahead of plan in terms of what we're seeing there.","We're seeing a lot of energy from both sales teams. We've now fully integrated them into a single unified sales team. Probably seeing a little more traction in terms of the Equinix team selling into the Telecity assets, but that's probably to be expected.","And I think we're starting to now get the former Telecity employees really fully up to speed on the broad level platform and seeing a lot of energy on that. And so that's another really critical litmus test I think and one that we've learned from previous acquisitions that it really requires a lot of attention, and I feel good about how that's proceeding as well.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","At what point should we think of those assets back to company-level growth?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Again, there's a couple things. Number one, Telecity assets as you know are more fully utilized than our assets. And so it's really about the combination of the two businesses on continuing to grow and prosper collectively. So, it's hard to say specifically what Telecity as an entity \u2013 when we'll get back to historical growth, because ultimately what we're doing now is selling across our platform.","I think what's most important is recognizing that the integration process will be basically fully complete by the end of next year. We fully expect to get all of our cost synergies. We're seeing some opportunities where our revenue synergies are starting to realize, which is good. And again, we've got very little, if you will, dollars allocated to that in fiscal year 2016, but we're seeing many green shoots of opportunity.","And then I think just overall it's the scaling of our platform across Europe not only as we take what assets we have today, but we invest in the platform on a go-forward basis with some of these 18 projects that are underway that I think will really make a difference.","And you combine that with what Charles said earlier on or what Steve's talked about from the enterprise perspective, we're really excited about certainly seeing more momentum coming out of that specific entity, but it's really more about the collective business that we're looking forward to executing against.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you, sir. The next question on queue is coming from the line of Mr. Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. You may begin.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","Great. I just had some quick modeling questions. One, you at your Investor Day stated you expected to do greater than $18 in AFFO per share in 2017. I'm just curious with the uptick in AFFO this quarter if that's still the right way to think about that?","Secondly, when you provide your guidance for 2017 next quarter, I assume you'll give organic growth rate like you've been doing, but I just want to make sure that it's correct that Telecity and Bit-isle will be included in that new calculation? Then just last real quick, your European or EMEA business was a little bit lighter than we were anticipating, and I'm just curious relative to your expectations with the moving parts with LD2 and Paris, if there was anything there that's worth calling out that might explain maybe some of the differences we're expecting? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Okay. So, let me take them one at a time, Colby. First and foremost, as it relates to an AFFO per share of $18 a share for 2017, we continue to expect to deliver that or better, consistent with what we said at our Analyst Day, despite what transpired this specific quarter.","As we think about the planning for 2017 and the guidance that we'll deliver in 2017, no surprise to you as we continue to integrate the platform it really becomes one entity and less about organic versus inorganic. So, we fully anticipate in 2017 that we'll give you complete guidance that includes all three entities on a go-forward basis. And given the fact the cost structures are effectively integrated now or well on their way and we've sold off a number of our non-core assets in the Japanese business, I think it makes best sense to give you one holistic number on a go-forward basis that you will measure us against.","And then as it relates to EMEA, absolutely there's a number of things that are going on in the business this quarter. If we're dealing with just top line, other things of course are impacting the business. First and foremost is the LD2 asset sale at $3 million. We get a little bit of a benefit from the Paris acquisition.","And then currency, despite my comments that our hedges are working well. You still have the currency impact. Particularly as it relates to Telecity and as you might have recalled in my comments, only 50% \u2013 we only have hedged 50%. And the reason we only hedged 50% is until we can get the European entities from Telecity into our platform and in our structure and commissioner structure, any hedges that we place against the cash flow is below the line and not above the line; and as a result, you've got some deterioration as it relates to currency movements in the marketplace.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Colby, this is Steve. I think it's also critical that all of us on the call remember that, I mean, we're pretty fortunate with all the digesting of the activity that Keith and Charles are talking about in Europe that we had a record bookings quarter. So like the pipeline is strong. The coverage ratios are strong. So, while all this is going on with digesting this acquisition, we had very good performance of bookings this quarter. A record for that region.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","Great. Thank you.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Thanks, Colby.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Next question on queue coming from the line of Mr. Michael Rollins of Citi Research. Your line is open. You may begin.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Going back to slide 3, there's a mention of margin expansion for 2017. I was wondering if you can give us a sense of how you're thinking about margin expansion in terms of magnitude? And how you're balancing that with some of the investments that you've talked about in the past to further some of the strategies around the enterprise, cloud and investing in new ecosystem opportunities? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","So, why don't I take the first part, Mike, and then I think Charles or Steve will want to jump in. I think first and foremost, one of the things we wanted to do was certainly give you an indication that our aspirations and our intent is to continue to deliver improving margins as we come through this year and we look into 2017.","I think that was the purpose of that disclosure on page 3. I think to tell you how much we're going do right now, that's \u2013 you'll have to wait until February for that one, because we're still working through our strategic plans and budgeting exercise for the year.","Suffice it to say, we are looking at a number of different investment opportunities and as you've heard me say before, I think others have certainly said the same thing is a lot of times when we look at how we invest in incremental projects or initiatives, it's really about how do we find our highest and best use of our costs?","And so sometimes it means that we reallocate certain cost in areas where we think it's a higher and better use of that capital. So, as we look into 2017, the team's working really hard not only to bend our cost curve, but also to squeeze out more opportunity to fund many of the initiatives that we're looking at that Steve spoke about and Charles has alluded to.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Charles, any other response?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, Mike, again, I think the way we look at it is that our job is clearly, margin expansion absolutely a priority for us. But our bigger priority is really create durable long-term value for the shareholder. And so, where we think that we can make an investment that we think is going to create an enhanced ability for us to tap into what we think is a huge addressable market opportunity in front of us then we're going to make a balanced decision to do that.","So as Keith said, we're in the midst of making some of those assessments now as to what that will look like for how we'll guide for the year ahead. We still have work to do. We're very pleased with our progress in terms of the evolution of our sales team to be a more capable solution selling enterprise sales team.","We're really happy with how our channel continues to scale, but are continuing to look at investments there that are necessary. We feel like we're going to need to continue to evolve our service portfolio to really be responsive to the enterprise market opportunity.","All those things are things that we'll look to make some balanced investments in. So, we definitely think there's built to scale and other reasons, opportunities for us to expand margins going forward and we continue to be committed to that, but we'll balance that really against long-term value creation.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Mike, I'll give you another dimension on how we think about it, but Charles is spot on with how we're thinking about that. We kind of put it into four buckets. We continue to invest where we can extend our market leadership around interconnection in our inorganic activity and getting that digested.","Secondly, we're continuing to invest and accelerating, as Charles said, capturing enterprise. So there's a whole bunch of activities there with our channel and our innovation and our business development activities.","Third, we're always seeding future ecosystems. So, our marketing organization spends a lot of time in the future areas around the next version of cloud where security's going to go, where FinTech is going to take us, where the Internet of Things is going to take us.","And then lastly, Charles drives a lot of activities in the company to simplify ourselves for growth \u2013 systems, people, process, et cetera. So, that's the simplest way to think about where investment areas would go.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. I guess one other follow-up real quick. You mentioned your aspirations around investment-grade credit. You also discussed trying to find the optimal target leverage, I think, for the business. What is that range or where is that optimal level today? And as you're targeting more Fortune 500 businesses, do they care if you're an investment-grade, credit-rated company when they do their supplier analysis? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","That's a great question, Mike. Look, we continue to expect that three times to four times net leverage position is appropriate for the business. Right now, there's a fair amount of cash on the balance sheet, as I said at the Analyst Day. And truly, I'll carry on that today that our cash will get consumed in the business, not only as we fund our capital expansion initiatives, but as we continue to pay our dividends and service our other obligations as they come due.","That all said, as it relates to customer opportunities, I'm sure there are customers out there that would like to see us in investment-grade. It doesn't come across my desk. I don't think in my entire career, that somebody has not selected us because of our credit rating. But from my perspective, if that's important to somebody, I'm sure we can demonstrate why we are as good as an investment-grade company as anybody else.","And so, I'm not particularly worried about it; but again, I think it is important for us to aspire to that and eventually get there, because as interest rates move one way or the other over some period of time, whether that is over a year or over the next five years, we certainly want to enjoy that lower cost of fund relative to some of our peer companies and the like. And so, our goal is to become investment-grade at some point but we're not going to compromise on our desire to grow the business on an organic basis and invest in our capital.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Okay. I would say that on balance, I believe our financial health and our balance sheet tends to work to our advantage in those situations relative to all the other options available to customers very frequently. So, I have not seen it work the opposite direction for us typically. So, we tend to be very favorably aligned in that.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks very much.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you, sir. The next question on queue is coming from the line of Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Your line is open. You may begin.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Just as I look at the planned expansions for next year, you've got kind of looks like $300 million or so at some of your most densely interconnected assets like Ashburn and San Jose. And just kind of maybe see if you have any comments about what the visible demand is like there and whether the delivery at those particular assets could mean we'll see an acceleration of interconnection growth as those start to deliver just because of the particular assets that we're seeing.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Well, yeah, I mean, I'd start by simply saying that right now, we continue to see a very favorable supply-demand balance in the market. So, in fact, I think that many of the markets that we operate in, I think, would be on balance more towards the supply-constrained side of things. And we see a lot of opportunity out there.","We see a very robust pipeline in our core sort of campus markets, which is why we've got builds going on in many of those markets. And as you noted, we clearly have a pretty significant portion of our total interconnection portfolio residing in those markets, and so they tend to flow through with interconnection demand in a very healthy way.","So hard to calibrate that precisely, but I think it would be fair to say that we're continuing to invest. I mean, that's the reason why we see such healthy returns in those markets, and that's why we're trying to really allocate a larger percentage of our total CapEx portfolio to those markets.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up, maybe I missed it, but did you give exactly kind of what the non-cash adjustments for Telecity were that had the impact on the EBITDA margin?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, Paul. The majority, they're all sort of predominantly lease-related. There's one, as I mentioned, the larger one that affected the results was a capital lease entered. Our debt went down conforming to an operating lease treatment.","And then there's a number of other, what I call acquisition-related adjustments, that's the biggest area. there's a few other what we call conforming areas where we've taken Telecity's operating policies and procedures and conforming it to Equinix's standards, such as bad debt and sales allowance, deferred installation and the like.","And so for all those reasons, as we come to the closing out period of the Telecity acquisition and finalizing their results into us, it's important to recognize that these small adjustments that take place during that period. The lion's share of them, of course, as you would expect, is around leases, and lease accounting. And hence, why there's really no meaningful impact to AFFO, it's really just moving cost from one bucket to the other, if you will. And therefore, it doesn't affect AFFO or AFFO neutral.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Next question on queue is coming from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Your line is open. You may begin.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I just had a question on the undersea cable projects that appear to be accelerating globally. Clearly, you've had good success in terms of winning those bids, but I'd like to hear how you're thinking about those wins in terms of strategic importance versus maybe the direct revenue impact from those cables landing in your facilities. Just trying to figure out if this initiative is mostly about enhancing your magnetism around the cloud and content providers or whether you think there's a more direct kind of immediate growth impact?","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, sure. This is Steve. Let me start, maybe Charles you can chime in here. First, a little context. I think we've mentioned just a couple times, that we are staring at somewhere near the magnitude of 50 projects around the world of which today we've \u2013 as we told you on the script today, we've had 12 wins, 8 are in operation, 4 are under construction. These are all around the world and these are as we've stated in the past, where the technology has advanced to the point where our data centers are located in so many locations there accessible to these cable landing, that the regeneration points they used to have to do when they hit land they can take them straight inland now to an Equinix facility.","So, we're working with the suppliers of the cable. We're partnering with them. We're working with the funders of these big cable projects and we're treating it as, like we would any other pursuit. And we want more of that traffic and it's being, these things used to be funded by the big networks years ago. Now they're being funded by the big cloud providers, because they are getting ready for all the cloud traffic that's going to traverse the world.","And as we said today we want, the premise of the company is to get more bits of traffic flowing through these data centers. It will pull colo, it will pull interconnection, it will give us several advantages here.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. And there's ripple effect I think in that there is, we would definitely consider these consistent with our ecosystem strategy which is, identifying critical magnets that will create sort of vibrancy in the ecosystems that we're targeting.","And particularly now as these sub-c projects are being sort of executed and funded not only by the traditional telecom community, but now by the hyper-scale cloud players. We believe that getting these strategic wins is important to the continued evolution of these ecosystems. And so while they will have a direct and positive financial impact, we think that the broader ecosystem story is really the key part of it.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just one follow-up on the margins, I'd like to hear, I don't know if you gave us an update, but the prior target for 100 basis points of margin improvement in the kind of core Equinix business, just like to hear how you're tracking against that goal year-to-date?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","It's a great question. I think when we started the year, we were looking at basically, fiscal year 2015 was 46.7%. As we reported last quarter, we thought we could do a full 100 basis point improvement.","With these adjustments, which are 30 basis points we're now looking at again on a normalized margin of roughly 47.4%. So, slightly impacted by these adjustments; but again, as you know, we're really focusing on cash on cash delivery in the business. And there's no impact to AFFO at this juncture. But, it is a slight deterioration in the margin.","And as we look forward to the fourth quarter, clearly we want to continue to drive margin \u2013 continue margin into the business. If you take out the acquisition-related costs in integration, we're close to 48%. And again, that's a great position to sort of end the year at as we start to think about fiscal year 2017.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Next question on queue coming from the line of Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. You may begin.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. I've got two quick international questions and then one related to EBITDA. So, on slide 7 for EMEA, I wondered what would the cross connect number be? You list 46,000 and change, but what would that number look like if you were to included Telecity now that you've owned the asset for a time and presumably understand that situation a little better?","And then on Asia, I was just interested in China. You've talked about the opportunity there and with plans to maybe enter Beijing. It doesn't appear on your tracking sheet at this point. So, at what point do these sorts of things appear on the tracking sheet that you have contemplated for the future?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","So, Jon, let me take the first one. I think Steve, Charles will take the second one. As it relates to the cross connects, certainly as we \u2013 one of the main things that we have to do when we integrate one company into our platform is get a good handle on the data bit. And understanding exactly what the inventory is, whether it's a cabinet, whether it's a cross connect or power circuit. That's an evolving exercise, as you can appreciate. So, we'll move both the Dutch business and the UK business on the platform, but we're still in the process of making sure that we've clearly understood what basically the unit of measures are.","And as a result, it's premature to tell you what the cross connects are. Suffice it to say, though, it would be meaningfully higher than what we're seeing here. Telecity historically had said some \u2013 had given some numbers in the marketplace. We want to step away from those numbers, but knowing that they are \u2013 there's a meaningful step up in cross connects, if we take the inventory that we see today and apply it to our unit count.","That all said, I also want you to understand though that Telecity didn't \u2013 they didn't really monetize those assets in a way that would be consistent with Equinix. And hence, I think that's the opportunity that we all see in front of us. Is there an opportunity to over some period of time take the cross connects, add more value to the assets by tethering them together and then being able to monetize that with our customers over some period of time? But rest assured, it's a number that we want to give you. We're just not at a point that we can at this stage. But over the not too distant future, you'll be getting some input on that number.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","And then Jonathan, this is Steve. On the China update \u2013 no new update today on activities with our partner. We're working pretty hard with our partner in Shanghai and looking to expand that to \u2013 up north to Beijing. But I would tell you that that's \u2013 most of that activity is going to be a 2017 discussion. There's a lot of work going on today that's bringing the big Internet companies out of China into Europe and the U.S. and so our team's very busy with export stuff coming out from the Baidus and the Tencents and the Alibabas. But going deeper into China, our first half there is to get more capacity in Shanghai and then find our way into the next big market. And you'll hear more about that as we move into 2017.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then maybe for Keith. Do you anticipate any further one-time impacts to EBITDA related to integrations underway over the next couple of quarters? Or is that \u2013 most of this behind you?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Hi. Well, it's a good question, Jonathan. I think as it relates to what we're doing right now, this is bringing us to Q3. Without getting into the dynamics of purchase accounting you really have to complete the majority of, if not all of your acquisition entries by fourth quarters end. So the fourth quarter theoretically would be the time line that we basically would have locked down all the financials and conformed them (57:44) standards. So theoretically, there could be some adjustments in Q4. We are not guiding to them. We don't see any, but I just wanted you to know that, that could take place.","Any adjustments post that, unfortunately, will run through the financials in a very discrete way. And certainly, we'd share that with you at a point in time. But as we stand here today, there is no other meaningful planned adjustments to their books or records at this point.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Next question on queue coming from the line of Mr. Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. You may begin.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Yeah, Keith, just to follow-up to that question. What about integration costs? You accelerated some of those this quarter, so how should we think about integration costs in Q4 and beyond? And talking about the balance sheet and investments, what's the latest thinking on owning real estate? Do you see any opportunities to increase that proportion of your portfolio over the next year or so? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, Simon. So in our abridged pages, which eventually I'm sure you'll digest them, you'll see that we've earmarked roughly $17 million of integration costs for Q4. That will bring the total year up to $59 million. That is $4 million higher than we originally anticipated for the year; but at this point in time, because we also have costs earmarked for 2017, we think that we're actually not going to increase that in 2017. In fact, as we stand here today, I think we would reduce it by a $4 million all else being equal. And so right now, the overall project is consistent, the overall integration plan, I should say, is consistent from a dollar perspective.","As it relates to acquisition of other property, both raw land, if you will, and then also the land underneath the IBXs that we operate today, we're always looking to acquire those property. Charles alluded to a number of acquisitions that we've made as of late, whether it's the Silicon Valley land, the DC land, Chicago. There's Frankfurt. Some of the land lease arrangements will made in Amsterdam and London.","We are actively as a company trying to acquire more property where we can to enhance our campus; but at the same time control more of our revenue from an owned perspective. Right now, our revenue at least on an organic basis with the owned assets is 39%. On a consolidated basis, it's roughly 35%. We want to see that number up, and our stated objective \u2013 we'd love to see it around 50%. I don't know if we can get there or when we can get there, but certainly that's our objective is to own more and more of our properties.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Next question on queue coming from the line of Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open. You may begin.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you. I want to discuss the bookings. Can you characterize those relative to what you've seen in last 12 months? So, maybe the types of customers and the rates you're seeing and the length of contract? And how has that changed in the last 12 months versus what it's been in the past?","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Charles, do you want to take that?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, again, we had a very healthy quarter. I think that we \u2013 every quarter's a little different in terms of whether or not we see any kind of large footprint activity, and so we did see a bit of that in Q3. We do see a healthy pipeline right now of cloud activity both on the larger footprint size as well as more in the traditional sweet spot. And then, of course, we're seeing continued strength in enterprise demand.","So again, we had records in several of our verticals and near records in the others. So really good strength across the verticals. I would say that we're really hitting our stride in terms of being able to generate higher numbers of sort of sweet spot deals and really accelerating the amount of business we can do in each quarter.","From a rate perspective, I think we're seeing solid pricing trends across our geographies and really hitting the sweet spot in terms of some of these enterprise-use cases around Performance Hub, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, et cetera, and I think that's a lot of what's driving the bookings momentum at this point.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.","Great. Thank you. That concludes our Q3 call. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining.

Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm excited to share our 57th quarter of consecutive revenue growth, as we continue to capture powerful digital ecosystems at global scale. We see strong secular trends driving our business and are adding new customers at an accelerated pace, as enterprises adopt hybrid and multi-cloud as their IT architecture of choice.","Cloud migration and data center outsourcing show continued momentum and we outperformed the market with share gains across all three regions. We also made great progress towards our $3.6 billion acquisition of Verizon's U.S. and Latin America's data center portfolio, which we expect to close shortly.","We remain highly confident that this transaction will create significant value for both our customers and our shareholders, strengthening our market differentiation, and delivering AFFO per share accretion on day one, excluding transaction and integration costs. Turning to the results for the quarter, we started off the year with healthy bookings, fueled by strong growth in our global network vertical and continued enterprise momentum.","As depicted on slide 3, first quarter revenues were $949.5 million, up 11% over the same quarter last year, on a normalized and constant currency basis despite the LinkedIn churn. Adjusted EBITDA was $427.6 million for the quarter, up 10% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, consistent with our expectations given the Q1 seasonal costs.","AFFO growth was 13% year-over-year, on a normalized and constant currency basis, the result of strong operating performance and lower than planned taxes and recurring capital expenditures. We added 11 Fortune 500 customers this quarter, all enterprise and financial services and continue to expand our traction with these critical lighthouse accounts.","Our global platform is sustaining a strong growth momentum, with three region revenue deployments continuing to rise. This quarter over 58% of our revenue came from customers deployed across all three regions, up from 56% last quarter. Also over 83% of our revenues are from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 82% last quarter.","Interconnection revenue grew 18% year-over-year, on a normalized and constant currency basis, significantly outpacing collocation revenues. We continue our healthy pace of cross-connect ads and our ecosystems are now underpinned by 237,000 cross-connects and dramatic growth in our market leading Equinix Cloud Exchange.","The business ecosystems inside our data centers remain at the heart of our strategic operating model, and are a significant differentiator for Equinix. We run the largest internet exchange platform in the market and have globally deployed greater than 4,000 ports delivering over 6.3 terabits of traffic per second, up 26% year-over-year.","We also saw a strong adoption of our Cloud Exchange, which simplifies enterprise connectivity to major cloud services and networks. In the first quarter, AWS, IBM, Microsoft Azure, SAP and ServiceNow all expanded into new metros with Equinix's Cloud Exchange.","We now have over 800 Cloud Exchange customers, including 150 that will be migrated from the former Telecity Cloud-IX platform.","Turning to acquisitions, our acquisition of Verizon's 29 data centers will strengthen our global market leadership and create new opportunities as we build on these enterprise rich assets. Verizon will add over 600 net new customers, bringing our combined platform to over 9,500 customers and accelerating our ability to help companies extend their IT operations to the digital edge through the interconnection of people, locations, clouds and data.","Enterprise and financial services firms represent one half of the revenues related to this acquisition and their customer base will add a number of notable global 2,000 customers to our platform. Pro forma for Verizon, we will now service over 40% of the Fortune 500 and gain access to a set of accounts with significant up-sell opportunities across Platform Equinix.","The Verizon assets expand Equinix's total global footprint to 179 IBX data centers across 44 markets, comprising approximately 17 million gross square feet, further expanding our scale and accelerating critical relationships in the government and energy sectors. We also expect to unlock additional capacity to capital expenditure investments in these highly utilized assets with expected expansions in both Culpeper and Miami's not for the Americas as well as Denver, Houston and Sao Paulo.","In the 12 overlapping metros, we want to enhance our value proposition by tethering our assets together as an early step in our integration. To support these newly acquired sites and sectors, we expect to bring on over 250 Verizon employees, primarily in operations and are excited to welcome these new colleagues to the Equinix family.","In March, we further expanded our relationship with Verizon by announcing a global agreement to resell our colocation interconnection services enabling their enterprises to build hybrid cloud solutions and gain quick access to our multi-cloud environment.","This agreement represents one of many exciting developments in our broader business development portfolio with our strategic partners and we look forward to updating you with further details related to these relationships in the coming quarters.","Turning to Telecity and Bit-isle, we're pleased to report that the integration programs continue to proceed smoothly, with the majority of the integration effort largely complete. These acquisitions have positioned us well to capture the strong demand we're seeing in both the European and Japanese markets and are selling across the combined platform to capture this growth.","Now, let me comment on our development activity. We continue to invest in response to strong demand and are selling incremental billing cabinets at a healthy clip. Our utilization rate is 79% and we have 20 announced expansion projects underway. This quarter, we are moving forward with three additional expansions in London, Paris, and Sydney, totaling $145 million of planned capital expenditures. Over 50% of our development is on owned land, and we expect revenue contribution from these owned assets to grow as we sell in these markets including Amsterdam, Ashburn, Frankfurt, London, and Silicon Valley.","We continue to purchase additional land to fuel this trend towards owned assets. This quarter, we purchased 34 acres of land in Ashburn, Virginia, for approximately $35 million. These four parcels of undeveloped land are proximate to our main Ashburn campus, one of the world's most substantial interconnection sites, and will provide us room to build multiple new greenfield data centers that would add approximately 20,000 cabinets in this critical market.","Our capital investments are delivering very healthy growth and strong returns as shown on slide 4. Stabilized IBX revenues grew 6% year-over-year on a normalized basis, largely driven by increasing cross-connect and power density. We have updated our analysis of new expansion and stabilized assets to now include Telecity and Bit-isle IBXs.","Our stabilized asset count increased from 70 to 99, which includes 26 IBXs from our acquisitions, as well as three net-new IBXs from our annual refresh as more assets move into our stabilized category. These stabilized assets are collectively 82% utilized and generate a 30% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.","Now, let me cover the highlights from our industry verticals and I'll start with the networks. This vertical experienced record bookings in the quarter led by the major telcos, who are expanding their capacity and capabilities for digital services such as OTT, cloud, and security as well as refreshing deployments with upgraded optical technologies.","Expansions included BT Global Services, who is making major investments across EMEA for their core backbone network, and Colt Technology Services, a global telecom provider building out its new digital platform. We also are maintaining significant momentum as the interconnection partner for new submarine cable projects including winning our 15th project this quarter, which we'll announce details on in the coming months.","The financial services vertical saw continued growth as firms broaden the use of Platform Equinix to accelerate IT transformation in their businesses. In addition to ongoing growth in electronic trading, we continue to make progress penetrating new segments including insurance and banking. This quarter Progressive Corporation, a Fortune 100 property and casualty insurance company, leveraged Platform Equinix to improve user experience for its employees, reduce network costs, and improve distributed data management capabilities. We also see other insurance firms such as Lloyds and Aon driving similar value by leveraging Platform Equinix.","In the content and digital media vertical, it saw its strongest revenue growth in the publishing and advertising sub segments. We added multiple new logos in the advertising segment including OpenX, which is expanding its compute node across Platform Equinix to support a growing user base, as well as a top 20 video platform filling the majority of its ads through Equinix's advertising exchange.","The cloud and IT services vertical achieved solid bookings led by EMEA and strong growth from software-as-a-service providers. We're increasing our density and coverage of both infrastructure-as-a-service and software-as-a-service providers, making it easy for enterprises to find and consume cloud services. Expansions in the quarter included deployments from Oracle, SAP and T-Systems as well as a leading storage hosting provider, expanding its presence on Platform Equinix and joining our cloud exchange.","And turning to the enterprise, this vertical remained our fastest growing with recurring revenues surpassing $100 million and a record quarter in terms of new enterprise logo wins. Our enterprise penetration spans many sub segments including manufacturing, travel, healthcare, energy and government, as all of these sectors work to modernize their IT architectures for cloud and digital transformation.","In addition to these broadly applicable use cases certain segments have industry-specific needs as well. For example healthcare providers are leveraging Equinix to help manage data for real-time clinical research analytics, while addressing regulatory compliance mandates such as HIPAA.","Healthcare customer wins this quarter included Eli Lilly, a global pharmaceutical company. Enterprise new adds jumped up significantly year-over-year with 40% of these customers coming from our indirect channel. Partner contributions continue to be significant and now account for over 16% of our total bookings with two-thirds of this activity from resellers.","Additionally, we've seen consistent trend of two-thirds of our new customer adds coming from the cloud and enterprise segments. This presents a strong land and expand opportunity for us over time.","So, let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone. As Steve highlighted, Q1 was another very solid quarter and has set us up nicely for 2017. Revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO were all above our expectations, absent the impact of recent financings to fund our pending acquisition.","We're on track to deliver higher levels of bookings and strong incremental revenues compared to 2016 and our operating metrics including MRR per cabinet, net cabinets billing, net cross-connect additions showed strong performance in the quarter.","We're very excited about the pending Verizon transaction. We firmly believe in the merits of this highly compelling acquisition, both from a customer and a shareholder perspective. This acquisition will extend our market position across the Americas region, enhance our global interconnection platform while providing strong incremental value on a per share basis.","Once closed, we'll invest, unlock and expand the capacity in these assets, tether the less network-dense assets to our network-dense campuses, up-sell our products and services to the 600 plus net-new customers, as well as invest in the assets to reduce the level of churn experienced in the business over the past few years.","Verizon is currently a substantial customer of and key partner to Equinix. And concurrent with the close of the transaction, we expect to finalize our agreement with Verizon on their affiliated revenues in the acquired sites making Verizon one of our largest customers. Now based on our updated view of the business, although it's still early in the process, we're raising our expected Verizon acquisition revenues guidance to now range between $480 million and $500 million for the first 12 months post close with adjusted EBITDA margins of 60%, which excludes an expected $40 million of integration cost anticipated to integrate the Verizon assets.","We'll update the Verizon data center acquisition guidance on our Q2 earnings update, post-close the transaction. By then, we'll have an updated view on the anticipated customer churn, the level of revenue reserves required and the conformance to our reporting methodologies. From a consolidated basis, the increased scale and reach from the combined business should enable us to continue to expand our margins, while creating significant value for our platform.","As it relates to both Telecity and Bit-isle integration efforts, we've seen steady progress towards the integration of these businesses. Consistent with our prior comments, we no longer will separate out the Telecity and Bit-isle results and we'll instead report our financials and key metrics on a consolidated basis going forward.","Also this quarter, we closed the relatively small $37 million acquisition of IO's UK data center near our Slough campus. And in early April, we completed the ICT-Center purchase in Zurich, a less than $5 million acquisition. These two small acquisitions will add additional capacity in these key markets.","For integration cost in 2017, we continue to guide you to approximately a $30 million including the first $2 million of cost related to the Verizon asset acquisition incurred in Q1. The timing of the incremental Verizon integration cost will be updated on our Q2 earnings call.","So, let me turn to the first quarter. Q1 was another strong quarter of operating performance as depicted on slide 5, global Q1 revenues were $949.5 million, up 2% over the prior quarter and 11% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis, reflecting the positive momentum in both the MRR and NRR revenue lines.","Q1 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $12.3 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter, and a $5 million positive currency benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates due to the weakening U.S. dollar.","For 2017, we've now hedged over 60% of our EMEA revenues and cash flows. Our global platform continues to expand with Asia-Pacific and EMEA showing normalized and constant currency growth over the same quarter last year of 15% and 14% respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 6% despite the $6.8 million in revenue churn related to LinkedIn. Our MRR per cabinet yield remained strong, we had a 2,000 net billable cabinets after absorbing 1,300 cabinets of churn related to LinkedIn. Also, we had a 7,100 net cross-connects in the quarter.","Global adjusted EBITDA was $427.6 million, up 10% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46% excluding integration cost of 45% on a as-reported basis, a step down over the prior quarter largely due to seasonal costs. Adjusted EBITDA also includes $12.3 million of integration cost this quarter.","Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, had a $10.8 million negative impact when compared to our average FX rates used last quarter, and a $500,000 negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates.","Global AFFO was $304 million, up 4% over the prior quarter, largely due to lower recurring CapEx and income taxes, while absorbing almost $10 million in a higher interest expense from our pending acquisition financings. AFFO on a normalized and constant-currency basis increased 13% over the prior year.","Now moving to MRR churn. Q1 global MRR churn was 2.8% better than our expectations and includes LinkedIn's churn in the Americas region. We're pleased with our team's progress towards refilling the space with a number of ecosystem enhancing deals. For the full-year 2017, we continue to expect MRR churn to average 2% to 2.5% per quarter.","I'd now like to provide some highlights on the regions whose full results are covered in slides 6 through 8. The Americas region had a solid bookings quarter with ongoing strong outbound production and the highest level interconnection as a percent of revenues of the three regions.","EMEA delivered record bookings in the quarter with particular strength in our UK and Dutch markets, as well as strong bookings from our cloud vertical as many CSPs continue to place edge nodes infrastructure in multiple markets. As part of our interconnection strategy, we've also start to invest in a number of fiber builds to support our core ecosystems across our key campuses in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Manchester, and Milan. Asia-Pacific outpaced worldwide growth with strong momentum driven by our content and enterprise verticals.","Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business. The Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA interconnection revenues were 24%, 13% and 8% respectively of recurring revenues or 16% on a global basis.","We're now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to slide 9. As you all know, disciplined capital allocation is one of our highest priorities as we selectively expand the business across our regions, while strengthening the global interconnection platform. In March, we raised over a $3.4 billion in debt and equity to complete the financing of our previously announced Verizon asset acquisition and support the continued demand that we see across each of our regions. This mix of debt and equity allowed us to preserve our strategic and operational flexibility and maintain current debt ratings, while providing a highly accretive transaction for our shareholders.","Unrestricted cash and investments at month end increased to $4.9 billion. We expect to fund $3.6 billion to close the Verizon transaction this quarter. Our net debt leverage ratio, net of unrestricted cash was slightly above 4.0 times our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA, pro forma for the Verizon asset acquisition.","Given the favorable cash flow attributes of our business model, we expect to return to our targeted leverage ratio of three times to four times net debt to adjusted EBITDA in the short-term.","Now switching to AFFO and dividends on slide 10. For 2017, we expect our as reported AFFO to be greater than $1.214 billion, a 13% year-over-year increase despite the incremental $53 million of interest expense related to our high yield offering.","On a normalized basis, AFFO would be greater than $1.331 billion, an $18 million increase compared to the prior guidance demonstrating the continued strength of our operating model. On an as-reported AFFO per share basis, we expect to deliver $15.66, which includes $87 million of incremental interest expense related to our term loan B and high yield financings, $30 million of integration costs and an additional 6.1 million shares related to the equity issued in the quarter.","The as-reported does not yet include the operating benefit attributed to the Verizon asset acquisition. We've assumed a weighted average 77.5 million common shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis. On a normalized and constant currency basis, we expect AFFO per share to be $18.33, a share of 1.4% increase over the $18.07 noted in the prior quarter.","Turning to dividends, we announced our Q2 dividend of $2 a share, maintaining the same level of cash dividend per share despite larger share base. For 2017, we expect to payout total cash dividends of approximately $612 million, a 24% increase over the prior year.","Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 11. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $277 million, including the recurring CapEx of $23 million, slightly below the low end of our guidance expectations. During the quarter, we open new phases in Dublin and New York and continue to progress with the very active pipeline of new capacity, which includes an opening of an additional four new data centers in 2017, being Amsterdam, Ashburn, Virginia, Frankfurt and Silicon Valley.","We continue to invest in new capacity and our 2017 capital expenditures are expected to range between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion for the year. And finally, please refer to slides 12 through 16 as these slides bridge our 2017 guidance from our normalize 2016 performance.","So, I'll turn the call back to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Okay. Very good, thank you, Keith. And finally, on slide 16, we summarizes our updated Q2 and full-year 2017 guidance including the impact of FX changes.","For the full-year of 2017, we are raising our revenue guidance to be greater than $3.976 billion, a $43 million uplift that is a combination of currency benefit and improved operating performance. Also for 2017, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to be greater than $1.86 billion, an $18 million uplift.","So in closing, we're benefiting from our global reach and interconnected ecosystems, which is translating into firm MRR yield for cabinet, healthy interconnection activity, strong bookings and accelerated new customer capture. We live in network density, cloud density and size and quality of customer base all of which we expect to significantly grow over the coming years. We are expanding our product portfolio to drive revenue and continuing to refine our go-to-market engine to execute on our strategy. Our growth and scale are driving increased AFFO and cash flow and dividends. And we will continue to focus on creating sustainable value for our customers and shareholders.","So, let me stop here, and I'll turn it back over to you, Cary to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. So I have a couple. I wondered if you could remind us what you're seeing in terms of book-to-bill trends, what is it and has that changed over the past couple of quarters? And then on CapEx, maintenance CapEx seems to have trended a little bit lower, both in terms of dollars and percentage of revenues and I wondered if this is sort of a new level that we can expect going forward? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, Jonathan. So, a couple of things. I think, when we discuss the book-to-bill interval, we're continuing to see improvements in our book-to-bill. And so there is nothing, I would say, to share with you other than we're seeing slight improvements and we're continuing to work to reduce that interval.","As it relates to the recurring CapEx, we were like this quarter at $23 million and certainly relative to the prior quarter. But as you look at our forward guidance, not only for Q2 but for the rest of the year, you'll see that there is a step up. And it's roughly $160 million to $165 million of recurring CapEx for the year, which is 4.1% of our revenues. But again, there is nothing than really timing that's affected our recurring CapEx this quarter. And again, it will go back to, I think, traditional levels in the near-term.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then just real quick on some of the regional color. The Asia-PAC saw a little bit of deceleration in cabinets added. And then I think even in the U.S., excluding \u2013 if you take out the LinkedIn churn, there is also a slight deceleration there as well. Anything going on there, that is worth pointing out?","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","I think when you look at cabinet, as I mean, with 3,300 cabinet as across the portfolio as we said in our prepared remarks, Americas continues to be next quarter production to the other two region. So, when you look at a platform as a whole, 3,300 net cabinets billings when you take out LinkedIn churn is one of our best quarters ever. And so, there is nothing that really is going on in any given region other than to say timing always has an impact on when we book and when we churn. And so I'd just say that, that we're really pleased with the overall performance of our platform.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is now open.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. First, I was wondering if you cold unpack a little further the strength that you saw in the network vertical during the quarter, and since network is the longest standing vertical that you had. What's driving the particular strength in, how should we read into what your customers are doing in terms of whether it's network topography or what they might be investing for in your facilities?","And then secondly, if you can move to the sales side of the business, you mentioned, about the Verizon distribution agreement and I was wondering if you could kind of put that in the context of the sales strategy and what you're doing with the sales organization more broadly to continue to pursue whether it's the Fortune 500 target that you have or the broader expansion of your customer base? Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Do you want to start on that, Charles, here?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Sure. I'll start on both and you can add any color you want. Mike, relative to the network vertical, I think there is a variety of trends that underlay that. As you know, it is \u2013 as you said, it's one of our most mature ecosystems. It really is our most mature ecosystem and we continue to see real strength there in terms of continued bookings \u2013 incremental bookings from our key network service provider partners. And I think we're driven by a number of factors; one are some of their expanding portfolio of services and their need to upgrade their architectures to do that. Also I think an increasing level of sort of receptivity towards the new age, if you will, of how customers are consuming services and the need to sort of be very present with technologies in the key points of aggregation and I think that has really increased their level of appetite for working with us on a number of things, and that includes \u2013 and then there is also a tech refresh element as they're upgrading their network in a number of dimensions in terms of new technology and moving to 100 gig, et cetera. But a lot of the various telco as well as cable operators are implementing over-the-top services and other digital services such as video-on-demand that are driving a number of those sort of demand drivers for us.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. I think \u2013 go ahead, Keith.","Unknown Speaker","Well, just in terms of the Verizon distribution.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","And on Verizon, I mean, I think that it speaks to a couple of things that we talked about in the script. One is the sort of new logo capture that we're seeing and that being driven in significant part, about 40% of the new logos for us being driven by channel partners. And what we're seeing is that partners who are delivering certain elements of service to the customers are also realizing that their customers have a demand for hybrid cloud as the architecture of choice and are really looking to Equinix as a key place to build that out.","And so the agreement with Verizon is a great example and just one of several where we're seeing real momentum with the network service providers and carriers that are trying to deliver a more complete solution to their customers. And because many of those carriers have really now stepped away from actually continuing to invest CapEx in their colo assets and have divested them, a number of them are saying, hey, we're going to have to lean on partners to do that and Equinix is really the key partner of choice. So, I think it dovetails with the strategy in a number of ways in terms of how we see partners playing into the overall strategy.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. I don't have anything to add. I think that's well said. Does that answer your question, Michael? We might have lost you.","Operator","Should we proceed to the next question, speaker?","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, go to the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Your line is now open.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple questions. First, you mentioned the enterprise as being your fastest growing vertical and listed a number of the sectors, kind of within there: manufacturing, healthcare, energy. And I was just wondering if you have any color \u2013 whether you'd point to any of these subsectors as being kind of at an inflection point where demand is really ramping? And then maybe how much kind of the interconnection density varies across those different industries and whether there's kind of real upside from cross-connects there?","And then, the second question just on the Verizon revenue guidance from, I think it was from $450 million to $480 million to $500 million, maybe if you could give a little bit more color there. Is that just due to kind of the lease base from Verizon or are there other drivers? And maybe anything else you've seen in terms of your diligence, you've had three more months in terms \u2013 or a couple more months at least in terms of just kind of looking at maybe some of the regional centers, for example, within the Verizon portfolio? Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Sure, Paul, this is Steve. Why don't I start out and Keith and Charles can supplement here. But on the enterprise question we \u2013 there is a lot of horizontal use cases that we're experiencing across all these industry verticals: manufacturing, healthcare, retail, et cetera. Many of these companies are in the early stages of moving portions of their enterprise workload to hybrid multi-cloud architecture. So they're looking for help to do that, that's a use case across several of the industry verticals. Many of them are optimizing the network as you heard Charles just talk about. Many of them are big distributed global companies and so distributed data management is a typical use case. Unified communications is showing up in some of our use cases and in many cases as they look at their data center portfolio and look at consolidation, that ends up being a requirement that shows up for us.","But we're seeing many, many use cases now really start to show up that are not only those horizontal ones I just described but also vertically. And they range from real time analytics for product lifecycle for manufacturers, clinical research for healthcare, digital commerce for retail providers. So we're seeing all kinds of use cases now that are starting to show up vertically. And so our teams are studying those to determine where to go in deeper. And it's exactly what we predicted was going to start happening. But they're founded on the horizontal use cases, I think. I don't know, Charles, what you would add there?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. No, I would just double-click a little bit on your question relative to interconnection density and upside that might exist from that. Basically, as Steve said, we see \u2013 we often see an initial deployment motivated by some sort of horizontal requirement. And Steve mentioned several of those, could be network optimization, could be a basic sort of hybrid cloud or cloud connectivity, number of other things. But then we see typically that being proven out on a smaller scale and then expanded significantly in terms of geographic expansion and then use case expansion vertically on top of those implementations over time.","And so, what I would tell you is I think there is cross-connect upside to those customers. They \u2013 but then there is also port upside because cloud exchange is going to be a key method for interconnection for them in our centers. And so \u2013 but I think the key point is really that as you look at the sort of relatively modest size of those deployments, but with broad geographic distribution and strong interconnection, I think what we're seeing is the opportunity for those to be accretive to our yield per cabinet story over time, number one. And number two, to be really sticky in terms of being resistant to churn over time. And so, we think those are two things that really drive two key levers in our business and that's yield per cabinet and churn.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","So, Paul, let me just respond then to your question on the Verizon revenue update. As we said, our current thinking right now is revenues would range between \u2013 now range between $480 million and $500 million which also includes the affiliated revenues related to the Verizon transaction. I think it's important to note though, in at least our prepared remarks, is that also contemplates what we've assumed is what churn might look like with their customers, what our reserve positions have to be vis-\u00e0-vis that revenues. And also includes our methodologies and how we report revenues. So overall, feel good about where we are today. As we said, we're going to update that once we close the transaction and on the Q2 call, we'll give you even more clarity on where revenues will be, but this at least gets you to think a little bit about where revenues could go.","I think it's really important, though, to note a couple of things here. Number one, we are extremely bullish on what we think we can do with the assets. The things that we talked about first and foremost is using our capital to expand in the critical markets where there has not been capacity before, and so taking our platform and selling into that opportunity with expansion dollars is going to be really important. You coupled that with the fact that we have got very network dense assets and we can then tether those assets to the less network dense assets of the Verizon portfolio, which would typically be the non-Terremark assets.","And then you got new products and services, you've got the investment we want to make in our operating performance and how that would affect churn. Overall, that's what gives us the comfort with what a positioning is but it's really the translation of that revenue due to the value on a cash flow basis per share. And I think if you take the $480 million to $500 million and you multiply by the 60% margin, that's going to give you roughly $294 million of EBITDA.","As you can see on \u2013 for those that aren't paying attention at least, on slide 15, we've given you a number on an AFFO per share basis, both on a normalized and as reported basis. Right now that as reported AFFO per share number is $15.66, and you take that $294 million of EBITDA, and given the fact that we're about $87 million of cash interest in there and we have got the diluted effect of our equity financing but $494 million is going to turn into almost $3.80 of incremental AFFO per share and that sort of pre-tax. But it gives you a sense between that and the integration cost is a meaningfully accretive transaction to us and \u2013 so we encourage you to go do the math, but also give you a sense of the bullishness that we exhibit inside the organization for the completion of this transaction.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. I pile on a little bit, Keith, and just say that, when they does settle, I think, we felt a really sense of optimism about quality of the assets we're getting, the quality of the team that we're getting even though, it's relatively small, but I think, a strong team that brings some additional expertise in quality into the Equinix family. Also, I think the customer response to the pending acquisition has been extraordinarily positive. I think they're very excited about the prospects of us continued in investing and deliver value through those assets to them and I think that gives us an increased level of confidence about our ability to manage and mitigate turnover time.","And then also as the number sort of fleshed out about what the overlap look like, a net new 600 customers of very high quality and with significant up-sell potential across global platform. And so, I think for a variety of reasons, we continue to be really optimistic about where we landed there and are excited about path ahead.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much. Keith, if I could follow up on some of the commentary you just made about the Verizon assets, it seems though, we've run through that math, as you mentioned, significant accretion from that perspective. How do we think about the incremental opportunities on the assets, if we were to frame them or layer them on top of that, sort of financial framework? And what I'm trying to assess here is, as you mentioned improving the utilization and expanding the use of the assets, but also I'm thinking about it relative to your multi-year growth outlook that you had provided last year. We saw sort of where the growth trajectory of the business has been and I am just trying to figure out sort of the math in terms of the benefits to AFFO, but also how to think about it within that context of being able to drive greater than 10% growth over a multi-year period?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Look, I think you're asking a very appropriate question, part of the reason that we wanted a further discussion on this until Q2 is, we still have to capture all the information to get to as billing, billing these customers in our billing systems, which will again open over the very near-term. That all said, I think it's important to note, whether you look at Telecity or Bit-isle or for that matter, you look at the Verizon assets that we're acquiring. If you look at the 8-K that we filed, for the March financing it gives you a sense of the performance of the business. It doesn't tell the whole story, I think that's why it's very important that you understand what we intend to do with the business on a go-forward basis.","And therefore, you've got a relatively slow growing business that we're introducing into a faster growing business. Obviously, initially it's going to be dilutive. Now that said, as you have to understand, we're going to take that portfolio and we layer into our platform. And we're going to make sure we put the customers into the highs and best use \u2013 we'll take a highs and best use view on where to put and place those customers. And so overall, we really want to talk about the platform recognizing that you've got slower growing businesses.","That all said, I think the key walkway from a shareholder perspective, your focus, your sole focus is really what are we going to do on a value per share basis. And I can tell you that the view that we have with integrating these assets, putting them into our platform and then drilling them up with our mindset, I think the value that we'll be able to drive on a per share basis is something that will be attractive to our investors. And again, it's not going to happen to anyone as you can appreciate, because we have to make these investments, but you're going to see relatively fast out of the gate we'll be making decisions that would be indicative of where we're going to take this business.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Keith, thanks. Amir, said another way, I think in the near-term, you're going to see a blending of the growth rates as we integrated into the Americas business. And as Keith said, on a longer term basis, once we start investing in these assets in Culpeper and Noda (43:54) and Denver, Houston and Sao Paulo and we tether those assets as Charles and Keith talked about back into our core network hubs and we start cross-selling into them and we'd layer in our customer service on top of those customers. You're going to see churn stabilize, you're going to see growth start to take off, you're going to see the global selling engine driving a whole of these assets and selling into them from a much greater velocity than they've ever been sold into before.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thank you very much for the incremental color.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","Our next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Just one quick housekeeping question. The 7,100 cross-connects, were those all organic or are there any more adjustments to Telecity or Bit-isle that ultimately showed up in the first quarter metrics? And then I appreciate that you aren't giving more specifics on exactly when the Verizon deal closes and I don't believe you've given integration costs, but can you give us any color on the magnitude of what the integration cost could be for the second quarter specific to Verizon? And then just lastly, you guys talked about last quarter ramping up the sales force. I was just curious if you can give us an update on where you're at on that? Thank you.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","You want me to start or do you want to start?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","I'll take the \u2013 I'll take the Verizon and you take the sales force, Steve. I think it's important to note, when we talk about shortly, you could also say imminent, so the deal will close imminently. And so, we are eager to get that behind us. As it relates to the cross-connects, that is an organic number. There is no adjustments. So it's organic to \u2013 with Telecity and Bit-isle and right, Kat?","Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.","Yes. It's all into the 7,100.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","And then, as it relates to the integration cost, what we said last quarter was, when we disclosed the Verizon transaction there will be roughly $40 million of integration cost. We incurred $2 million of integration cost in Q1. So there is $38 million more to go. If I break down that $40 million, I would expect again, it's going to depend on exactly when this transaction closes. But if it's imminent, we would expect roughly $30 million to $35 million of integration cost to be realized this fiscal year in 2017, and then $5 million the following year. Again, those are preliminary numbers. We'll update you as we close the deal, and update our guidance on Q2 but that's our current thinking.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Well, 2017 total integration...","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Will be $30 million to $35 million.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","All-in with Bit-isle at $60 million...","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","It will be $60 million to $65 million.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","So, $60 million to $65 million.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Is that helpful, Colby?","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's awesome. And then, just the sales force would be great.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","And what, Colby, was the question on sales force?","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Just curious what the update is in terms of the sales hiring that you guys had talked about doing for the year?","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","The journey is off to a good start beginning of the year, mostly in the Americas. We're still \u2013 in Europe, we are still leveraging the integration of the Telecity and the Equinix core team and then in Asia, mostly focused on channel hiring. So I think the total head count now for quota bearing ballpark coming out of the gate here in the beginning of the year is somewhere in the order magnitude of \u2013 I think we exited the year about 360 to 365 and we are up to about 386 million, 387 today of quota bearing heads. So we're still adding as we go through the year. That's obviously spread across the globe and we're adding some support behind that.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","And, Colby, just to comment that we part of \u2013 I think we've seen an accelerated rate of new logo capture, I think we're seeing strong awareness in the market around the value propositions that we've talked about in some of these horizontal, as well as vertical value props. But we're starting to see the channel uptake and drive that as well, which has given us some confidence to do these additions and feel like we're going to get strong returns from them.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. And if you guys are hiring in EVP Strategy, let me know, I am in the market.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Sure. Noted.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, this is Richard (48:27) for Phil. One quick clarification. In terms of cross-connects and in the Americas it was up $3,400, but revenue was only up $1 million quarter-to-quarter. Is there \u2013 is that just timing or is something else going on there? And then normally the top 10 customer list doesn't change very much, but (48:45) it seems to have shifted and more cloud and IT and then a customer that only has four locations, but disappearing in the top 10. Just kind of wanted to get a sense of what we should \u2013 how should we look at the new list?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. So first and foremost, when you think about the cross-connect ads relative to the revenue, of course, a lot of that is just timing and it's the timing of when things get realized versus not realized, so nothing out of the ordinary there. As it relates to our top 10 customer list, the thing that certainly worthy of note here is, I just want to confirm with Kat, so this is fully included Telecity and Bit-isle, right?","Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. So this is the updated makeshift here, so now includes Telecity and Bit-isle on the top 10.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","And so you see a dramatic shift and five out of the top six customers are cloud and IT-based companies. And the largest of course being an enterprise-oriented company. So, it's more about the integration of the Telecity and Bit-isle results into our key metrics.","Unknown Speaker","Okay, great. Thank you.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Great.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the question. In the quarter you saw nice sequential increase in revenues year up and continues strong cabinet ads. During the quarter, you also announced some cloud infrastructure \u2013 you made some cloud infrastructure deployment announcements. Would you say the demand is driven \u2013 is still reflecting really demand from SaaS providers or are you also seeing enterprise demand to connect into the SaaS platforms?","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. I think, we are seeing across all, Robert, across all sectors. It's \u2013 the infrastructure players are continuing to what we call another wave of deployments. They have been at it for six years or seven years now. And so we are seeing a second wave of deployments into deeper out around the world. We are seeing the SaaS providers which are many more than the infrastructure-as-a-service providers are starting to show up at higher rates and then you are starting to see on the other side of that ecosystem, the enterprises connecting to both the SaaS and the infrastructure and platform providers. So it's coming out from all angles and the part that we're trying to learn as fast as we can on is what we \u2013 Charles and I described earlier on the enterprise, vertical use cases. We're starting to really understand the adoption rate of these enterprise industry sub verticals and understand those use cases. So we can go after them where there is like opportunities. So we're seeing demand. I would tell you from every core industry vertical that we've been in for 18 years and we're seeing a pickup with the advent of the cloud enterprise ecosystem that we've been talking about for several quarters.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. And just off of that, I think that we're seeing continued strength in momentum in the European business as a confluence of sort of two things, which is the timing of sort of cloud adoption and some acceleration of that in the European theater, and then combining with what I think we expected when we announced Telecity acquisition, which is a very strong competitive position in that market and a superior value proposition that's allowing us to capture sort of more than our fair share of demand in that market. So I think it's really a confluence of those two things coming together.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good afternoon \u2013 good evening, thank you. You've been highlighting the growing percentage of bookings coming from your channel partners over the last several quarters, and I think you said 16% this quarter. I'm just curious if there has been any material change in customer acquisition cost within the channel that I guess could drive longer-term improvement in gross margins as the channel continues to grow as a percentage of bookings?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. Not really is the answer. I think that, on balance, probably channel bookings are slightly more expensive, but in the grand scheme, it's a pretty marginal lift relative to the overall margin profile of the business. We are \u2013 one of the things is, at any point \u2013 any time you, I think, are building new channel sort of muscle, it's very important to ensure that you have a level of alignment between the direct and indirect sort of selling motions. And so, we are comping with that in mind. And so that does add a little bit of cost, but again, on balance, it's \u2013 we think that we're getting a level of additional reach and new logo capture, which if you look at it from a customer lifetime value and an NPV creation standpoint and you balance that against the very nominal incremental commission cost, we think it's great business.","And so, we're very excited about the progress of the channel, I'm feeling very good about the momentum there and I am feeling very good about the partners' ability to increasingly position the value of Equinix as part of their overall solution.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","I think this quarter, too, guys \u2013 I think it was about a third of our new logos came out of...","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","About 40%...","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Almost 40% came out of the channel. So, to Charles's point, we're really starting to embed our proposition with the channel partners to be able to talk for a full enterprise solution which includes using the Equinix IBX footprint around the world, so it's really starting to take hold.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, if memory serves, it seems like it's been a while since you called out any significant wins or kind of highlighted the growth from your traditional content customers. And I'm thinking specifically with respect to streaming and OTT platforms. I'm just wondering if you've seen any pressure from kind of more targeted edge data center providers in some of those Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets that may be kind of taking some incremental bookings activity away from customers in that vertical?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Not really. I would tell you that I think we continue to have a lot of the sort of CDM type players as very significant customers that continue to grow with us. And I think that that includes carriers who are increasingly in that business in delivering OTT type services. So I think we see strength there. I think there is a limited market particularly around the delivery of consumer media and digital media that is out there and the cable operators are active in that market, but it hasn't really impacted our business from a share perspective. And we continue to see them seeing Equinix as a primary point, because of our network density to deliver those types of services from.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. From a number standpoint in this quarter, actually that vertical represents about 14% of the recurring revenue and the bookings are generally in that same zip code, 13%, 14%. So we don't really \u2013 to Charles's point, we are not seeing a change. Most of that is because we're still over-indexing in enterprise and cloud and so the growth rate of bookings or recurring revenue is still the highest in cloud enterprise and network.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much. I think, Keith, in the back you talk about the escalators and 2% to 3%, 5% escalators in some of the contracts. Maybe you can just update us on what the book of business or your overall revenue stream looks like in terms of how much is escalators, what's the average escalator and maybe what the term of contracts is at the moment?","And then, on the seasonal costs, you obviously flagged that as being a factor sequentially, I think particularly sales and marketing was up a lot. How much \u2013 maybe you can just drill down into that a little bit more, how much of that is kind of one-time or will flow through into Q2, any sort of itemization there would be great?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Okay. So let me just take them in order, Simon. I don't think there has been any meaningful change in what we think about from an escalation perspective, 2% to 5% is typical in our contracts. And as you can appreciate, every contract is negotiated separately with the customer and so it depends on their starting point versus their end point. But I think for all intents and purposes, you can assume a 2% to 5% rate of escalation.","Our net pricing actions have been very positive over basically the last two years. So I feel good about the position we've been in from a pricing perspective relative to price decreases. The average contract life is still two years to three years, but certainly as we continue to invest more across our platform with customers who are putting their critical infrastructure across multiple markets with us, you're seeing an extension of term and that can range from five years to seven years and in some cases 10 years. And so very large base, it's not moving the averages much, but certainly there's an indication that there is a number of longer-term contracts that are coming into our portfolio.","As it relates to...","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sorry, just on that point, the stabilized growth of 6%, so is that fair to say then maybe half of that is coming from escalators?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","It varies. I mean a lot of (58:30) stabilized growth going down to 82% from 87% as you realize. So, it's going to change the mix of our discussion a little bit more because we've added all these new assets into the stabilized portfolio, but let me say to the extent some of the oldest data centers are getting a lot of it from volume. We sell more cross-connects. We sell more cross-connects and more power circuit, but of course then there is pricing actions as well. As it relates to, if you will, the newer of the stabilized assets, it's volume and price driven. No surprise to you, because you've got the portfolio that was not as highly utilized as the prior subset of assets.","But 2% to 5%, look, I would feel more comfortable if you said 2% to 3% is where you're \u2013 where you can get it from a net pricing action, and the rest is coming through volume.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. I doubt it's half of that 6% though because you do have again, in pricing although we have seen and continue to see net favorable pricing actions, you do have again older contracts, depending on where they were priced, may come out and sort of provide some sort of a sawtooth effect on pricing as they see escalators throughout the term and then maybe a rebaselining, which we will often do if we exchange that for longer term. So, I doubt it's half that but it does contribute and there is a fair amount of interconnection in power that I think make up the balance of the stabilized growth.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, okay.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","And then, Simon, just to answer your last question because I think it's an important question. Certainly, like Q1 if you \u2013 you can go back over many, many years, Q1 tends to be much higher, sort of higher cost environment than it is in Q4. A lot of it is to do with sellers and benefits, it's the fight to reset that we experience in the U.S. When you look at our SG&A base for Q1, our cash SG&A was $218 million for Q1. We guided you to \u2013 for the rest of the year to a midpoint of $820 million, which shows you that our average over the next three quarters again Q2, where we're guiding to about $210 million that our average is roughly $200 million. So, when you think about our costing environment we're going to affect the whole SG&A flat to down for the rest of the year. And it tells you that, you have this anomalistic charges that goes through your first quarter, but we also get benefit of what happens in the fourth quarter where our FICA goes down and there is some other seasonal cost that sort of come out of the equation.","So, overall, I think we've got a \u2013 what looks like an improving margin business through the rest \u2013 the next four \u2013 next three quarters of the year, you've got incremental revenues that \u2013 greater than that, what you saw in Q1, putting currency aside from \u2013 put currency aside, revenues you'd see a nice uptick in revenues for the next three quarters. And then, you would see our margins continue to improve through the rest of the year.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys. Keith, we might not have a lot to talk about in the next conference call on Verizon, but the AFFO accretion you are talking about, should that hit relatively quickly. It sounds like and\/or maybe just a rough timing on that? And then, on the \u2013 can you talk about maybe how their prices compare to yours on a per cabinet or square footage basis at this point? And then, maybe, Steve, can you talk about who your largest channel partners are to get a sense of that and is this 40% of new logos kind of a good way to think about the business going forward? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Tim, I'll take the first one and then we'll do jump off for the next two. Maybe Steve or Charles will take them. The \u2013 as it relates to the AFFO, I'm trying to give you a perspective on again what we are guiding you to, that $480 million to $500 million is post close for the next 12 months. We are assuming that revenues are going to be somewhat ratable over that period of time. So, relatively flat over that same period of time. That all said, therefore, you get to enjoy, if you will, the benefits of accretion right out of the gate. But you have to take out cost \u2013 the integration cost and the acquisition cost. I am assuming we're going to take those out of the equation. Similar to what we've done in the last few earnings call is we'll separate it for you when we do our analysis and our bridges. But that would tell you then for all intents and purposes you get that benefit of accretion real quick, pretty darn quickly out of the gate post \u2013 exclusive those two items. And what we've really said is day one is an accretive transaction. I think when you start to do the math and you think about $294 million of EBITDA what that translates to from an accretive perspective, when you look at the $15.66 versus the $18.33, you'll come out of the gate by the way and go, wow, that's a highly accretive transaction, again recognizing that we're \u2013 our intention is to continue to do better than we guide. And so we're going to work hard to drive as much value to the shareholder as possible and make it an even more attractive transaction for us as we look down the road.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","And just to be clear on the integration cost, does that include any CapEx that's required to get it up to your standards or would that be in addition to that?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","We're only giving you $40 million of operating expense related to \u2013 for the integration cost. There will absolutely be some costs that we will invest not only in expansion as I alluded to and I think, it was Steve and Charles that both said that we're going to invest in whether it's NAP of the Americas, whether it's Culpeper, Denver, another core markets that have been in our views underinvested in from an expansion perspective. There is certainly \u2013 there is some CapEx that we're going to put into the business to make sure that we operate it to our specifications our operating procedures. And so we'll recall single points of failure areas where we need to invest in end of life. We'll do that.","Again, that's something we're going to guide you to on the Q2 call because we'll have much better visibility at that point in time.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","And, Tim, on the channel most real quickly, we have three motions that we channel partner with. We have some flat \u2013 the first one is platform partners and these are the big hyper scalar cloud partners and there is a dozen that we have relationships within that vector. There is probably three or four that we focus on, it's the Oracles, the AWSs, the Microsofts. And then we have a reseller sell-through relationship with many, many 300, 400 partners here. But probably a dozen again, that we're very tight with which is companies like Datapipe, Accenture, Infosys, Unisys, BT, Dimension Data, companies like that. And then the third category is referrals, it's a very small part of the channel and it's a lead engine and they hand off lease to us, if we qualify and if we close them, they get a referral fee.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. And I would just add an additional \u2013 some of the best momentum we see is with what I would consider to be sort of integrated business service providers that maybe core telcos that are expanding their service offerings over time. Obviously, we are excited about the Verizon reseller agreement and our expanding relationship with them. But their global peers are companies with whom we do significant business and have great relationships. And so \u2013 and we expect that to continue. AT&T has been an excellent and exceptional channel partner for us. We continue to increase our investment in that relationship. And then the European and Asian peers that that are in those businesses including the likes of BT and T-Systems, et cetera, really who are delivering complete solutions to customers and really being able to effectively integrate Equinix as part of the story as they implement hybrid cloud, multi-cloud solution. So seeing real momentum there. SIs are a little slower to move, but I think have the potential to be just a massive opportunities for us over time.","And then as Steve said, some of these more new age cloud integrators that are right at the forefront of helping people migrate to hybrid and multi-cloud, the likes of Datapipe, et cetera, those are \u2013 we certainly tend to see continued success there.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank a lot, guys.","Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.","Great, thank you.

In the interest of wrapping this call in an hour, we would like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Thank you, Katrina. And good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report that Equinix delivered another quarter of strong financial results, and we made solid progress against our operating goals in the first half of 2012.","As shown on Slide 3, revenues were $466.3 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 18% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $222.1 million for the quarter, up 22% over the same quarter last year. Our results demonstrate our focus on disciplined execution, striking an appropriate balance between revenue growth, margin expansion and attractive returns on invested capital. We are executing on our strategy of building network density in key metros, deepening our ecosystems and interconnection across our 5 verticals and expanding our global reach.","Our global platform continues to be a unique competitive advantage for Equinix. Today, 58% of our revenue comes from customers deployed across multiple regions, and revenues from companies who are deployed in all 3 regions increased by 34% over the last year.","With more applications benefiting from a distributed architecture, we've seen attractive opportunity to help our customers expand their deployments into multiple regions across our global footprint.","Specifically, we have an increasing number of customers in Europe and North America who view Asia as a critical market for expansion. To enhance our ability to meet demand from these customers, this quarter, we acquired Asia Tone for $230.5 million, making Equinix the market leader in Hong Kong, strengthening our position in Singapore and establishing a significant presence in Mainland China.","Equinix gained a total of 6 data centers and 1 disaster recovery center, which includes 2 existing data centers in Shanghai plus a third under construction. This world-class data center is expected to open in Q3 this year, and we are already seeing a significant pipeline from customers looking to extend their footprint into Mainland China. Having just returned from Shanghai, I believe our strong local operating team, combined with this impressive facility, will give customers full confidence to expand with Platform Equinix into this critical market.","Similarly in Europe, we are using M&A to build network density in this region. Network density is the foundation upon which we build and support robust global ecosystems. As announced earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of ancotel, one of Europe's leading carrier-neutral colocation providers, for $86 million. With ancotel, Equinix increases its network customer base from 700 to 900, considerably expanding our network density to include a broad mix of networks from both Western and Eastern Europe. Equinix now operates in over -- operates over 220,000 net sellable square feet of data center capacity across 4 data centers in the Frankfurt market, one of the world's busiest data hubs. Ancotel also adds over 6,000 cross connects, bringing the total number of cross connects across Platform Equinix to approximately 110,000. Ancotel is a powerful addition to our European business and delivers significant value to our global offerings.","In the second half of this year, we will open several flagship data centers, providing additional inventory in key markets to satisfy our growing deal funnel and support the growth of our ecosystem. In Europe, we will open Amsterdam 3 located in the Amsterdam Science Park, one of the most carrier-dense locations in Europe, as well as Paris 4, which will be tailored to our highly networked Paris campus. In the U.S., we have 2 important new builds: NY5, which is located next to NY4, will provide critical inventory for the financial ecosystem; and Miami 3, located in Boca Raton, near several major fiber-optic cable landing stations in the lowest latency route to Brazil. These new data centers are in addition to the phased builds we will be opening in existing sites across all 3 regions.","In addition to growing our platform and increasing network density, we have launched a handful of efforts over the last year aimed at expanding operating margins and improving capital efficiency.","On the demand side, we have implemented several mechanisms aimed at carefully managing our existing customer mix and assessing new deals in terms of size, power density, target vertical and interconnection profile. These efforts are delivering strong results in terms of revenue yield per cabinet and overall price stability and are allowing us to fully realize the benefits of our ecosystem strategy.","On the supply side, we have broadly implemented our IBX optimization program in the Americas and are actively incorporating elements into both EMEA and Asia Pacific. Through this program, we rigorously evaluate our facilities with a focus on balancing space and power utilization, increasing energy efficiency and identifying ways to add sellable capacity with limited incremental investment. Over the past year, we have generated substantial energy savings, significantly improved our customer mix and increased our sellable inventory by over 2,000 cabinets, including 700 this quarter, giving us more than $50 million of incremental revenue potential with very little additional capital expenditure.","Our intention is to remain disciplined around our ecosystem-driven strategy, and IBX optimization is an important component of that. Applying the strategy to both new customer acquisitions as well as renewals is proving to be the right balance to enhance our returns. As we saw this quarter, this program may result in a temporary increase in churn, which is more than offset by margin improvements as we resell capacity at market rates.","As an example around renewals this quarter, we negotiated with a top digital media customer to embark in a multitiered plan to further optimize their multitiered architecture. This deal will allow us to retain the high-value elements of their deployment and preserve the majority of their high-margin interconnection revenue while transitioning out of the larger-footprint applications that are not well aligned with the Equinix value proposition.","This proactive effort will allow us to dramatically improve profitability with this customer and, importantly, will free up inventory in critical sites such as 111 8th in New York, enabling us to satisfy demand for other high-value applications.","In this specific instance, once the capacity is resold, we expect operating profit to improve by more than $1 million per month, nearly a full point increase in gross margin for the Americas business.","We believe this level of operating discipline is critical to our long-term success and essential to our ability to manage the business effectively through an increasingly dynamic market. We are executing with discipline and focus and remain on target to generate positive adjusted free cash flow in 2013 and over $3 billion in annual revenue by 2015.","So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to review the financials for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor","Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone on the call. So I'm pleased to provide you with additional detail on the second quarter. And as a reminder, with the exception of our consolidated financial results, all of the other metrics will exclude the impact of ALOG.","So I want to start with Slide 4 today for our presentation posted. Our Q2 financial results and key operating metrics closed very strongly. Global Q2 revenues were $466.3 million, a 3% quarter-over-quarter increase and up 18% over the same quarter last year. Our favorable performance was meaningfully offset by the negative currency trends across most of our operating currencies, reducing revenues by $3.9 million when compared to the average rates used in Q3 and $3 million when compared to our FX guidance rates. On an FX-neutral basis, our Q2 revenues increased 4% over the prior quarter and up 22% over the same quarter last year.","Pricing per cabinet equivalent remains firm across each of our regions. Global cash gross profit for the quarter was $320 million, or cash gross margin of 69%, higher than our expectation in part due to lower utility costs. Our cash gross profit increased 3% over the prior quarter and up 24% on a year-over-year basis. Looking forward, we expect the Q3 cash gross profit margin to decrease slightly largely due to higher seasonal utility prices. We expect our net utilities expense to increase by approximately $7 million over Q2.","Global cash SG&A expenses were $98 million for the quarter, slightly below our guidance due to slower-than-anticipated hiring, lower spending on advertising and promotion and less-than-expected spend on a global IT project.","Global adjusted EBITDA was $222.1 million for the quarter, a 48% EBITDA margin or a 3% improvement over prior quarter and up 22% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA reflects strong revenue performance, continued strong gross profit margins and lower-than-planned SG&A spending. On a normalized basis, taking out the net one-off benefits realized this quarter, our global adjusted EBITDA would have been $2 million lower, or a normalized adjusted EBITDA margin of 47%.","Global net income was $36.4 million for the quarter, a 19% improvement over the same quarter last year, the result of our strong operating performance and lower net interest expense.","Fully diluted earnings per share was $0.73, which includes the following: first, the dilution from 623,000 shares issued to partially settle our 2.5% convertible notes in April; and second, given the dilutive treatment of our 3% convertible debt, diluted EPS also includes 2.9 million shares attributed to this debt as if it's been converted in the quarter.","Looking forward, given the number of IBX openings in Q3, our depreciation expense will increase by approximately $14 million over Q2. Also, given the paydown of the Asia Pacific financing in July, we expect to write off the remaining debt issuance costs on the balance sheet attributed to this debt, which approximates $5 million. And finally, due to the closing of the ancotel and Asia Tone acquisitions in Q3, we expect to incur approximately $2 million of acquisition costs in the quarter.","Now looking at global MRR churn. Global MRR churn increased to 3.2% this quarter, higher than our targeted range in part due to the IBX optimization efforts that Steve outlined earlier. This churn allowed us to recover capacity in a number of highly desirable IBXs, and we expect to resell this space over the next few quarters.","Looking forward over the second half of the year, we expect our MRR churn to moderate down to between 2.4% and 2.8%. It is our expectation that continued discipline around deal mix and pricing will improve our operating model in terms of pricing and margin, it will increase our return on capital and it will lower our future churn risk.","So on this subject, I want to leave you with 2 key takeaways. First, global net booking activity is ahead of plan on a year-to-date basis, and we have a healthy backlog from the prior quarter's activity, driving the increase to our guidance. And second, despite the higher churn levels, which are fully contemplated in our guidance, we continue to deliver strong, sequential performance across our key operating metrics, that being revenues, gross margin and MRR per cabinet.","So moving on. Looking forward, the U.S. dollar exchange rates used for Q3 and the remainder of 2012 guidance have been updated to $1.21 to the euro, $1.55 to the pound and SGD 1.27 to the U.S. dollar. Our updated global revenue breakdown by currency for the euro and pound is 12% and 8%, respectively. The Singapore dollar represents about 6% of our global revenues.","Now touching on the tax area. As discussed on the prior earnings call and at our Analyst Day, we're continuing to look seriously at the global tax strategy, which includes assessing the feasibility and applicability of Equinix converting to the REIT structure. We continue to proceed with the due diligence and assessment of this structure. But at this point, we're still not able to update you on certainty or timing of this project.","Turning to Slide 5. I'd now like to start reviewing the regional results. So let's begin with the Americas.","Americas revenues grew 3% quarter-over-quarter to $297.1 million. Cash gross margin increased to 71%. Adjusted EBITDA was $145.5 million, an increase of 6% over the last quarter and up 19% over the same quarter last year. Americas adjusted EBITDA margin was 49% for the quarter. This region also absorbs all the corporate costs, including our global business system initiatives.","Net cabinets billing increased by approximately 1,000 in the quarter. Deal size and overall pricing trended positively compared to the prior quarters as we target small to midsized deployments where performance matters.","Americas interconnection revenue continues to represent approximately 20% of the region's recurring revenues, and we added a healthy increase of approximately 1,600 cross connects in the quarter. Our ALOG asset continues to perform well, in fact ahead of plan at the local currency level, and is gaining momentum.","Our growing deal funnel is driven by strong local and international demand in part due to the Olympics and World Cup planning as well as multinational expansion into the largest economy in South America. In support of this demand, we're building a second facility in Rio de Janeiro, which, while proceeding with the second phase of our Sao Paolo 2 IBX, both of these expansions are expected to open in Q1 of 2013.","Also, we're proceeding with the third phase of our Chicago-3 build. Chicago is a key bookings engine for North America, and the sales team has successfully positioned our Chicago suburb campus with customers looking for geographic diversity in North America.","Now looking at EMEA. Please turn to Slide 6. EMEA had a strong quarter and performed ahead of plan, and we expect the region will perform above plan expectations for the rest of the year. Despite the continued negative economic backdrop, revenues were $102.7 million, up 1% sequentially and 5% on a normalized and constant currency basis, benefiting from new and strategic installations as well as strong import activity.","Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $45.2 million or an adjusted EBITDA margin of 44%, a decrease due to one-off benefits in Q1. Normalized and on a constant currency basis, our adjusted EBITDA improved 4% over the prior quarter and is up 41% compared to the same quarter last year. EMEA added over 900 cross connects in the quarter, and interconnection revenues remain at 4% of the region's recurring revenues.","EMEA cabinets billing decreased over the prior quarter largely due to the termination of contracted space related to a large legacy digital media customer. That prior component [ph] of this deployment churned over a number of quarters ending in 2011, yet the billing cabinets churned this quarter, which drove the 4% increase in EMEA MRR per cabinet. Including this 1 churn, our net cabinet additions would have been 600, in line with past quarters.","And now looking at Asia Pacific. Please refer to Slide 7. Asia Pacific revenues improved 6% sequentially, or 7% on a constant currency basis, with record gross bookings driven by cloud, content, financial and network segments, including large inbound deals from both the Americas and the EMEA regions.","Adjusted EBITDA was $31.4 million, up 5% quarter-over-quarter and up 34% over the same quarter last year on an FX-neutral basis. Overall pricing remains firm in all of our Asia Pacific markets and pipeline for the new Shanghai expansion is healthy. Cabinets billing increased by over 500 from the prior quarter, and we added greater than 800 cross connects this quarter. Interconnection revenues continue to represent 12% of the region's recurring revenues.","And now looking at the balance sheet data. Please refer to Slide 8. Our unrestricted cash and investment balance was $823 million at the end of the quarter. This quarter, we increased our liquidity position through the completion of a newly negotiated 5-year, $200 million term loan and $550 million revolving line of credit. This new senior credit facility enhances our liquidity position while substantially lowering our negative carry associated with this increase in flexibility. In July, we completed the acquisition of both ancotel and Asia Tone, reducing our pro forma cash balance to approximately $500 million.","Looking at the liability side of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with gross debt of $2.9 billion or net debt of $2.1 billion, about 2.3x our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Subsequent to quarter end, our net debt balance increased to $2.4 billion.","Now looking at Slide 9. Our Q2 operating cash flow increased $194.8 million, a 55% increase over the prior quarter and up 39% over the same quarter last year. This substantial quarter-over-quarter increase was largely due to a Q1 payout of our 2011 corporate bonus and a large shift in our working capital balances. Our discretionary free cash flow was $157.2 million. We now expect 2012 discretionary free cash flow to range between $520 million and $540 million.","And now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 10. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $196.5 million, lower than expected and largely due to the timing of cash payments to our contractors. But also, the Americas region had a larger-than-planned savings on a number of key construction projects. Ongoing capital expenditures were $37.5 million.","And now turning to Slide 11. The operating performance of the 24 North America IBX and expansion projects that have been open for more than 1 year continue to perform well. Currently, these projects are 85% utilized and are generating a 33% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. Our 8 oldest IBXs grew 9% year-over-year as customers continue to buy additional power, cross connects and speed as it becomes available through our optimization initiatives. So at this point, let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Thanks, Keith. Now I'd like to provide an update on 2012 guidance outlined on Slide 12.","For the third quarter of 2012, we expect revenues to be in the range of $492 million to $498 million, which includes absorbing about $4 million of negative currency headwinds. Q3 guidance also includes $13 million to $15 million of revenue attributed to the Asia Tone and ancotel acquisitions, which closed in July.","Cash gross margins are expected to range between 67% and 68%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between $110 million and $115 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $220 million and $222 million, which includes $4 million to $6 million of EBITDA contribution from Asia Tone and ancotel and $2 million of negative currency headwinds.","Capital expenditures are expected to range between $240 million and $260 million and include expected CapEx for Asia Tone and ancotel. It also includes approximately $30 million of ongoing capital expenditures.","For the full year of 2012, we are raising total revenues to be greater than $1.92 billion, including approximately $30 million of revenue attributed to the Asia Tone and ancotel acquisitions and absorbing approximately $18 million of negative foreign currency headwinds compared to our previous annual guidance rates.","Global year cash gross margins are expected to be 68%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between $420 million and $430 million. We are raising adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year to be greater than $880 million, which includes approximately $10 million of adjusted EBITDA attributed to the Asia Tone and ancotel acquisitions and also absorbs $8 million of negative currency headwinds.","We are tightening our total CapEx guidance for 2012 at a range of $740 million to $800 million, which includes expected CapEx of $30 million from Asia Tone and ancotel. This also includes $135 million of ongoing capital expenditures.","So in closing, we continue to focus on strengthening our business model by putting the right customers with the right applications into the right assets. By targeting customers that value network density, reliability, application performance, ecosystem access and global reach, we continue to deliver strong results across all 3 operating regions.","So at this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. So Jerry, I'll turn it back over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sterling Auty.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Given the moves that you've made in Asia, I'm just kind of curious why you want to continue to expand in the region. How full do you feel your portfolio is now? And how much do you need to fill through acquisition from here to kind of capitalize on the strategy?","Stephen M. Smith","Sorry, are you referring just to the Asia region, Sterling?","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's correct.","Stephen M. Smith","Yes, well, we've got activity going on in all 3 regions, as you are aware. So if you look at the deal expansion sheet, you'll see that we continue to have capacity coming on in all the core markets. The decision going -- to do the Asia Tone deal was primarily driven by the opportunity to get ourselves deeper into Mainland China. We pick up a very solid operating team. We pick up 4 assets in that market, 2 existing ones, a disaster recovery center and a brand-new build, as I said, that will be opened in Q3. So this was emerging market decision. There's a couple of other emerging markets we're looking at, but in this part of the world, our customer demand from Europe and Americas into the Asian market is in the core markets. But as well, the demand has definitely picked up for Mainland China. So this is customer driven, demand driven. And the decision, we think, is going to play very well for us because the pipeline that's developing even before we've opened up. It\u2019s extremely strong. I just came back from a trip there last week and it's -- it will be one of the most impressive data centers in Mainland China. And the team we picked up on the ground is outstanding, and the pipeline is extremely strong.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And one follow-up question. You talked for a couple of quarters now about the increasing density and the increased power needs by customers. I'm kind of curious, which of the geographies are you seeing that playing the biggest benefit to your numbers and to your outlook?","Stephen M. Smith","Probably in the Americas. Charles, you have a thought on that?","Charles Meyers","I think that they -- I think power [indiscernible] requirements are less geographically specific as they are vertically specific. So one of the great things about the nature of our business is because we have broad coverage across a range of verticals, we are able to sort of mix business. And as we talked about in terms of the deal discipline, one of the things we're doing is really looking hard at the front end on how to balance power density in a way that really provides maximum return for the facilities. So as you're aware, in some cases, we have power utilization lagging space utilization, and that's a great opportunity for us to focus, for example, on content and digital media where we tend to see higher densities per cabinet in order to sort of sop up some of that power and provide greater returns on invested capital. So I think it's less regionally specific and more vertically specific. But it really depends -- our ability to exercise those levers really depend on the balance between space and power utilization.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Barden.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Keith, obviously another month since the Analyst Day has gone by. We -- you're still kind of I-dotting and T-crossing on the research you want to do for the REIT conversion process. Could you talk a little bit about, though, like how much time can really go by before you have to make a decision? And then, in order to get in a position to do what you want to do, presuming you want to do it by January 1, 2014, it feels like after 6 months, we should be getting closer to a conclusion. And then second, if I could, just I remember last year we spent a lot of time talking about the headwind costs of the additional 60% sales force growth that you guys brought on board. But obviously, even net of currency headwinds and factoring all that in, the guidance seems to suggest that the actual business will actually slow down in terms of organic growth in the second half versus what you've done in the first half. But theoretically, with these higher productivity salespeople, 60% growth year-on-year, I would expect we'd actually see accelerating growth in the second half of the year. Could you kind of talk about reconciling guidance and the -- this much larger sales force as it becomes more productive in the second half?","Keith D. Taylor","Great, both good questions. I think, first and foremost, when we look at the REIT, we really try to let of course yourself, David, plus the investing community know that this REIT discussion is a very -- a lot of work has to go into it. There's a lot of complexity, there's a lot of moving [ph] pieces than people would think. And you don't have to go very far to look at some of the other companies that have gone out there and disclosed some of the issues that they've had to confront. All that said, we think it does take quarters and it's not months. And because of that, we still -- we're doing a lot of hard work. And as I said, you met Randy [ph] and Catherine [ph] at the Analyst Day. They're working heads down with a bunch of advisers to help us think through a lot of these key issues. So I'd like to tell you, certainly, as the passage of time -- or as time passes, clearly we are closer and closer to a decision. But at this point, we're just not ready to give you a specific date because there's some things we're still chasing down. And hopefully, over the not-too-distant future, we'll go -- we'll give you more clarity. So that deals with that question. I think the second thing, I'm going to tag team with Charles. But I think it's important to note -- I think you should think about our business, and what -- and Steve talked a lot about it, with the focus around deal discipline and looking at sort of the right customer with the right application going to the right data center and making sure that we look to the mid and sort of small to midsized deals that really depend on performance. That causes us to really think about how we build out our facilities and what type of booking activity we have. All that said, when you look at the first half of the year and then you look at the second half of the year -- and I want to take out ancotel and Asia Tone because, again, as you know, they just closed. We've given you some directional guidance on that. If you go back and you look at just the organic business, the currency impact is not insignificant, as you know. It's $18 million in the top line, it's $8 million on EBITDA line relative to our prior guidance. And as you look at this quarter, as you look at this -- the -- at Q3, and I'll take that as an example, it's very -- when you start to take out the one-offs and you look at our guidance range, quite frankly, we're running at roughly the same level of growth quarter-over-quarter. And that's Q3 growth over Q2 versus Q2 growth over Q1. And then for the latter part or the last quarter of the year, as we've done historically, we're giving you just a greater than, then over sort of pinning ourselves a little bit into the guidance range. But it is a greater than and we fully anticipate we can deliver on those numbers, and yet at the same time, we're being somewhat cautious about our European business given the economic backdrop. And again, I want to remind everybody, when I said -- when I think about Europe, it did very well for the first half of the year. We think they're going to continue to perform above plan. But we will also want to remain very cautious about what they can do and cannot do. And so we're maintaining a little bit of that sort of that cautiousness in our guidance ranges.","Stephen M. Smith","Anything else that...","Charles Meyers","No, I guess I'll add a couple of things. This is Charles Meyers. And again, the underlying fuel, obviously, for the revenue growth is net bookings. And I think we're continuing to sort of work both sides of that in terms of on the gross bookings side, we are seeing improvement in productivity. In fact, this quarter, we've got the -- we've seen the greatest increase in new rep productivity since we began the sales force expansion in early 2011. So good signs there. We have pockets of overperformance, pockets of underperformance. But in general, we are seeing up and to the right, but -- overall. So balancing that against our desire to maintain -- continue to maintain strong deal discipline. And then on the churn side, we are continuing to make good decisions there that we think are in the best long-term interests of the company, and will drive performance over the long term. We talked about some of those in the script. To the extent we have some of those opportunities that drive long-term margin expansion, we'll take advantage of them. And we think that the guidance represents kind of a prudent look at what we said -- what we expect over the next quarter or 2.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","On Brazil, I was interested with the expansions that you announced. Are you planning to continue the existing mix of managed versus colo? Or will it be weighted towards one of the other segments going forward? And then domestically, for your business suite software, I wonder if you can kind of update us on whether you plan to expand that to additional geography beyond Virginia. And how much of that product is there left to sell at -- in Virginia?","Charles Meyers","Sure. Thanks, Jon. Relative to Brazil, actually, I would expect that we're going to see some shift, some slight shift towards a little bit more colo. I think it's still a very healthy managed services business. But because of the outbound business from the Equinix pipeline, which we're now really beginning to see accelerate, those customers are more typically colo-type buyers, although we do believe that once we get them in, we have a substantive opportunity to up-sell them into managed services in the ALOG asset and in the Brazil region. So probably, some slight shift in the near term towards colo, but we think again that will represent an opportunity for managed service expansion. And both deliver strong returns, so we feel very good about both of these expansions. Relative to the business suites asset, as you noted, we -- our -- in the last quarter, we triggered our phase II expansion early. And so we -- we've definitely seen strong demand. We do still have inventory available. We see a very healthy pipeline of opportunities to fill that. It is a key mechanism for us to use as we look at the evolution of customers to multi-tier architectures. And we found that, that plays very well. Customers who have -- currently may have deployments in core IBXs that we essentially moved to sort of high-value network nodes in the core campuses and moved some of their larger footprint applications into suites, we think that plays particularly well in Ashburn. And so we'll continue to invest in that product consistent with the demand we see.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then finally, the slide that shows the first 8 -- or lists the performance of the first 8 IBXs, I think you had a 9% year-on-year revenue growth, which is consistent with what you put up prior quarters. I was wondering how much of that lift is from pricing versus selling additional cross connects or other services.","Keith D. Taylor","Yes, and Jonathan, it's predominantly, as I said, selling more cross connects and more power. And to the extent that we have the ability to sell more space, I think there's the trend and the opportunity to get a little bit of a price lift there. But overall, it's predominantly due to more services that are being added to that mix.","Charles Meyers","Yes, the other thing is that in those assets, one of the things that fueled continued growth in there is our program. One of the elements of the IBX optimization program is to continue to look at -- ways to free up or augment capacity in those, and take underutilized power and monetize it more effectively. So that represents continued upside in those core assets.","Operator","We have a question from James Breen.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just had a question about the competitive environment now that we are a year past the Terremark and Savvis deals. Has the supply for data center space changed now that those organizations are part of larger organizations? It would have seemed when they were independent that a lot of their focus was on top line growth, which was directly tied into building out. Now the focus may be a little bit different inside those larger organizations.","Stephen M. Smith","I -- Charles, you probably have a deeper view of the -- point of view on that, but I would tell you that anecdotally at the top, as we watch these 2, they're very busy integrating these 2 assets, and they're completely consumed with shifting the core telco assets with the new managed service cloud capability that they acquired with those 2 companies. So I don't think there's any big difference in competitive supply. We haven't seen any new supply come on that's changing the dynamics of our pipeline, of our bookings rate in the critical markets. But I don't know if there's anything you'd add to that, Charles.","Charles Meyers","I mean, I would not say there's been any substantive shifts in the competitive dynamics in the market. I would -- in fact, I would actually say that those 2 companies, generally, I think, are often synergistic with us in the marketplace. They tend to sell at a higher layer in services. I think they target slightly different customer sets and application sets than we do. And so I've not seen what I would consider to be a substantive shift, particularly as it relates to those 2 companies. One thing that is happening, I think there is some customer reaction to the Terremark and at the Americas' sort of ownership situation with Verizon. We do think that represents some opportunity for us in the new Miami 3 asset and have seen a strong follow for network providers wanting to gain access to that facility. But then we also continue to work closely with Verizon as a partner and customer and are winning business with them on a global basis. So nothing specific relative to those 2 that I think are really impacting the competitive situation. And candidly, in the Americas, I think we continue to have just an extraordinary competitive position relative to the rest of the field, again because of our global footprint and kind of the really performance-sensitive segments of the market that we're focused on.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then just one follow-up in Brazil as you add those data centers there. Can you talk about any sort of differences between the U.S. market versus Europe versus Latin America in terms of siting the projects, power availability and so forth?","Charles Meyers","There's definitely some uniqueness to site selection in various markets across the world. But I think we've got a team that's got broad experience with that. For example, in Brazil, security concerns as to siting a location are a factor that aren't necessarily considered in other places. We consider that carefully as we made those selections. Power availability and the quality and reliability and availability of power is absolutely something that comes into play. But again, I think we've -- we feel very good about the site selection we made for the new Rio facility. And in the case of the S\u00e3o Paulo 2 facility in Canberre [ph], that really is a strong environment right now for data center demand in Brazil, and we're seeing that in the strength of the funnel.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rollins.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a few questions. First, if you can just talk about tally for CapEx for next year? If you look at all pending projects that will be completed in '13, what's that total for the CapEx at least so far that's slated for 2013? Secondly, Keith, I was just wondering if you can clarify. You guys have been good about updating your guidance each quarter for the moves in currency, and I feel like at times we lose sight of what the total FX impact is on the full year because we -- right now, we're thinking about it in your guidance relevant to what you gave in the prior periods. But can you actually help us take a step back and just give us a sense of what the total FX dilution is for the year, just to put that in perspective? And then finally, can you give us some details by segment, vertical segment, and maybe where you saw some strength or changes in the environment for bookings?","Keith D. Taylor","Yes, okay. So let's take the first one, CapEx. We'll probably have to come back to that one. We haven't actually calculated that right now. But clearly, as you know, the way that we report CapEx, it's on a cash basis. And so we're still pretty comfortable. As you know, we've tightened [indiscernible] on CapEx to $740 million to $800 million. That includes $30 million of CapEx for ancotel and Asia Tone. And so I think we're going to be fine within that range. And so my expectation is that the majority of that will be sort of spent in 2012. As we look forward to 2013, there's probably -- maybe we can get a little bit more accurate just maybe next time around. There's probably $200 million or less of CapEx that's already earmarked for 2013. And so it gives you a sense. And right now, we continue to look at projects. There's a lot of different things on the whiteboard, and we'll update that on the next call. I can now take you to the currency, and I'll pass it off to the other -- to Steve or Charles. Currency is very interesting. As you know, relative to the very first time that we offered guidance there, a shift in guidance that we've hit -- we've taken or absorbed is $42 million on the top line and $18 million in the EBITDA line since we delivered our first set of guidance to you in October. So a meaningful movement that we feel that we're absorbing. And recognize that we continue to perform well. And so from our perspective, we'll continue to update you on our performance on a year-over-year basis as needed certainly on a sequential quarter-over-quarter and then on a change relative to the guidance range that we're using. And I think it gives you a good sense of our, if you will, our currency-neutral performance quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.","Stephen M. Smith","And then on the vertical bookings in the quarter, Mike, the heaviest force was in cloud and IT services, which was about 26% of the bookings in the quarter. It's followed closely by network, which is still very, very strong for us, which is about 25% of the bookings in the quarter. The networks -- not surprising, I guess, it -- with all the network stuff going on, they're upgrading their networks and their infrastructure, we're winning service aggregation nodes. There's a lot of mobility expansion, infrastructure that we're seeing. Cloud stuff is coming at us from them. So network is still a very, very strong force around the world. And then followed by those 2. Financial services and content digital media were both about 18% of the bookings each. And then enterprise was about 13% of the bookings in the quarter. Enterprise is actually in certain pockets because of the cloud. We're benefiting from the cloud-enabled enterprise strategy. And they're starting to embrace hybrid cloud infrastructure deployments. And so we're seeing an uptick there predominantly in the health care and business and professional services subsegments. So we're pretty balanced.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Goldman.","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. I guess first maybe, Steve, you could talk a little bit about ancotel, bringing on a lot of network density in Europe and how you can leverage that with your existing base over there. But perhaps more importantly, does this help change the equation at all in terms of your ability to get a higher contribution from cross connects not just from bringing on the cross connects that they have already but in terms of your ability to charge for cross connects? And then secondly, maybe just to touch on the last question on the vertical side, maybe you could expand a little bit in terms of enterprise. You've talked at the Analyst Day about how that's sort of underpenetrated and a big opportunity. I think the level of bookings you just talked about probably exceeds your revenue exposure there if I'm correct. But maybe talk about your strategy to attack that more aggressively. And, on the cloud side, how the partnerships -- if you can give us any update in terms of the partnerships you've signed and whether or not they've been able to bring in incremental revenue for you.","Stephen M. Smith","Yes, 2 good questions. Let me start. I think Charles can probably give us some color on the second piece of that. But on the ancotel acquisition, the primary rationale for us in Europe was to increase our network density, which -- so our core value proposition, all the ecosystem activity and interconnection, as you all know, sits on top of a good choice around network density. So this is one data center. It's about a 23,000-square-foot facility. Very dense, 400 networks in there. 200 are actual new networks to us from 63 different countries. So it's a very diverse network base. As I mentioned, we did pick up about 6,000 new physical cross connects. And they've got a -- and -- this is very similar to a Meet Me Room in the U.S. So it's -- they've got a virtual Meet Me Room product that's very complementary to our interconnection portfolio. And this supports circuit-based peering and active Ethernet Exchange activity and have another 9,000 virtual cross connects that's not included in the cross connect count. We've got to go get our hands around that business. But generally speaking, this puts us in a very strong position in Germany to leverage the ecosystem focus on top of this network density. Choice provides all kinds of opportunity for OpEx takeout, for performance enhancement, et cetera, when you're thinking about the ecosystem. So that was the primary driver for this transaction. And I think from an enterprise standpoint...","Charles Meyers","Yes, building on the vertical question, I think that you're right, the -- so the 13% was the smallest contribution from our vertical. It is in fact, overindexed relative to our current revenue in that segment, and that's obviously a good sign. And so I think it demonstrates that we're building some momentum. A couple of things are happening in the enterprise. One, we've identified a few horizontal application sets particularly around WAN optimization and performance of people's -- the economic performance of their WAN that we think is -- are gaining some momentum. And then also, our success in cloud is essentially a sort of increasing returns effect. We are seeing great success with cloud service providers who, it's -- in many respects, obvious why service providers resonate with Equinix, particularly for revenue-facing application. But we think what that's doing is it will eventually promote sort of a cloud-enabled enterprise story where they're using hybrid clouds, private, public hybrid clouds as a fundamental part of their enterprise infrastructure. And we're beginning to see the early signs of that, and we think that's a -- that represents great potential for us over the long haul on enterprise.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gray Powell.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just had a couple. Maybe I missed this in the prepared remarks, but can you just -- can you help us quantify the impact to recurring revenue from the heightened churn that you're seeing? And then in the past, you guys have been able to sell forfeited space at a pretty decent premium. Can you help us quantify that premium?","Charles Meyers","Well, the -- on the second question relative to -- I think that the optimization efforts clearly involve us taking business that is typically being -- that's typically under market today and most typically associated with application sets that are less performance sensitive and optimizing that out and then getting into market rates. And we clearly enjoy a nice sort of price point in the marketplace because of the value we deliver on those higher performance. So it's really a matter of how much of a premium we get versus what was in there depends on, one, what was in there previously and how it was priced and what we replace it with. But in some cases, that's indicated by the optimization we outlined in the script. That can be very substantial and, in this case, we believe, has potential to expand operating margins in the Americas region by a full point. So that's kind of the story there. I -- and then the -- in terms of the revenue headwinds, it's fully contemplated within the guidance that we provided. And yes, it does have some near-term impacts, but typically, we're able to resell capacity quite quickly into -- because typically, these are into high-demand assets with high levels of fill. And so, for example, a couple of our large churn events that we've seen in the last few quarters are either already refilled or have ample opportunity in the funnel to refill those in the next quarter.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then I just wanted to switch topics. If I look at your same-store sales disclosure for the U.S. business, it appears that gross margins are already at or above your long-term targets. Do you think your long-term margin targets are conservative? And is there a point where you would have to think about increasing your LTOP?","Keith D. Taylor","So again, a lot of times, we're -- if you sort of step back to the Analyst Day, one of the things that we really talked about was bending the cost curve. And a couple of things that we're looking at is -- first and foremost is developing systems and processes that make it a lot easier for not only our customers to do business with Equinix but our Equinix employees can do business with Equinix. And so in both cases, you're -- what you want to try to do is take the frictional costs out of the equation. So we think we can do a good job in that and we'll continue to make that investment. And as usual it's a $30 million to $35 million investment, at least this portion of it. The second piece is we've done a really good job at managing the utility spend. And there's a lot of reasons that, that has happened, partly how we negotiate with our contractors. It's partly the infrastructure that we've put in and the efficiency programs that we have in place. And so when you look at those 2 costs and then at the highest level, the headcount costs, if we can do what we think we can do from the citizen [ph] perspective, it will allow us to bend that cost curve on a per-head basis over time. And so all that leads me to suggest that over a period of time, we think we'll continue to see margin improvement, and that margin improvement will come in both size -- sorry, in both areas of the -- of income statement and both on the gross profit side and also in the amount of cash spend that we see in the SG&A side and allow us probably over time to see some margin expansion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I've gotten so used to hearing about record bookings from you guys every quarter, and we didn't hear about it this quarter, understandably, given the economic environment. Some of your competitors have reported extending sales cycles, and I was wondering if you might give us some color in terms of your bookings levels and any kind of impact you might have seen from macro in the last 3 months.","Stephen M. Smith","Yes, it's a good question, Jonathan. And when -- we've got rising gross booking targets, as you would imagine, as we continue to grow the company. But funny enough you should ask. It was our second highest gross bookings quarter in our history. I guess we just decided not to throw that into the script. So it was very, very good gross bookings target quarter for us. And also, the net bookings were ahead of plan, as you heard Keith or Charles mention. Also, our cross-border bookings are still very, very strong, predominantly Charles's business pushing it out to Asia and Europe, multinationals that are still continuing to buy in those 2 regions, heavily from cloud and content digital media companies. So we -- the bookings engine is working very well. The productivity, as Charles talked about, is up and to the right. And the -- we're grooming the reps that aren't performing. We're running just under a couple of hundred reps around the world, quota-carrying reps. They're all selling Platform Equinix, growth in revenue sold [ph] was 34% up in all 3 regions year-on-year. So it's working. The sales productivity is happening. And we're -- as Charles said, we're managing. And Eric and Samuel are doing the same thing in Europe and Asia. Our deal discipline and our pipeline inspection on a weekly, monthly, quarterly cadence is at a whole new level, and that's helping us. We're very, very focused on getting the right applications into the right assets.","Charles Meyers","Yes. Jon, to directly answer the question in terms of are we seeing -- at least in the Americas, we are not seeing what I would consider to be any kind of effects of macroeconomic uncertainty or anything like that. I think our actual funnel coverage, if you look at our 2- and 3-quarter funnel coverage, we're actually more robust than we've ever been. I think we did have a quarter where we, I think, pulled -- had a very strong quarter and pulled a fair amount out of the funnel, which probably led to the not continuous records. But nonetheless, we delivered strong performance, continue to see coverage levels high, are not seeing extended sales cycles. They feel the same as they have been. So no real ill effects from what we can tell in the Americas business. And I think the broader global business is performing similarly given that we tend to operate in the strongest economic centers.","Stephen M. Smith","The only caution we'd add to is what Keith mentioned, which is in Europe, we're eyes wide open. We have to watch the market in the second half given the broader issues. But that team is doing very well and executing very well as Keith said, and they're ahead of plan. So we feel good about the overall plan.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Super. And if I could just get one housekeeping item. Keith, I was wondering if you can give me the RP [ph] basket numbers and the NOL number as of the end of the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor","There's no change in the NOL position. And the RP [ph] basket, I have not calculated this quarter. But clearly, there was more net income there. Add roughly 50% of the net income to the basket plus the stock option exercised in the quarter and it'll give you a sense of what that RP [ph] basket is. I apologize, I have not calculated it before this call.","Operator","Our final question comes from Simon Flannery.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two quick ones. Keith, you mentioned in your commentary about SG&A benefiting from better numbers on IT advertising, hiring. How much of that is something that will be ongoing savings? And how much was just timing between Q2 and Q3? And then at the Analyst Day, you talked about future data center builds. You'd like to own more of your data centers than leasing them. Can you just give us an update on your thoughts there?","Keith D. Taylor","Sure. Good questions, Simon. I think certainly, if you look at the SG&A spend and we look at our performance year-to-date, we've done better than we anticipated. We've done better than we guided to. Certainly, some of the costs are moving into Q3 and into the rest of the year, but there's an element that isn't. And hence, that's why we rose -- we raised our guidance by $10 million this quarter over what we had last quarter. And so just to remember, our EBITDA, we're raising it basically because we're keeping revenues -- keeping ancotel and Asia Tone out of it, we're keeping revenues at greater than $80 million, $90 million. And so when you then look at our EBITDA, we're saying it's greater than $880 million. Take off $10 million for ancotel and Asia Tone, it's greater than $870 million. Now that's a $10 million uplift, and we're absorbing $8 million of currency. So it's fair to say that some of the costs are going to be -- are permanent and some, of course, are going to be temporary. And we're going to continue to focus on our spend and try to marry it up as much as possible and deeply throughout the rest of the year. But it'll come in chunks at times, and we'll update on the next earnings call with that. When you think about then the acquisition of our assets, we're going to continue to look at it. We think it's a prudent thing to do as a business. So again, there's no meaningful update at this stage. There's a number of assets that are out there that are -- potentially could be acquired. But we'll have to take it on sort of on a periodic basis and give you an update when we're closer to realizing any decisions around that area.","Katrina Rymill","Great. That concludes our Q2 call.

Smith","Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon. And welcome to our First Quarter Earnings Call. We're off to a strong start in 2014 delivering both revenue and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance ranges. As depicted on slide three in our presentation revenues were $580 million up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 12% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $260 million for the quarter up 8% over the same quarter last year. We delivered solid results across the regions in our metrics including MRR per cabinet, - and cross connect adds reflect continued health of the business and a competitive edge from platform Equinix. ","We continue to be differentiated in the market as the only global interconnection platform which position us as the partner of choice for businesses with significant global requirements. Today 65% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple regions and that's up from 60% last year. And 80% of the recurring revenues comes from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 78% last year. ","Looking at our top 100 customers 86 are deployed in more than one region across an average of 10 metros. A metric that demonstrates the value of platform Equinix, reflects the very diverse revenue base and correlates with high levels of customer retention. As our customers distribute their infrastructure to improve performance and reduce cost we remain focused on delivering a consistent experience in how we design, build and operate our IBXs as-well-as how we market, sell and support platform Equinix. ","We continue to experience momentum across industry verticals and associated ecosystems. The network vertical delivered consistent growth with new bookings from service providers who are expanding their portfolio of cloud service and simultaneously upgrading our infrastructure to 100 gig and support explosive -- demand. Content also delivered strong bookings this quarter driven by global expansions from large players and continued growth of the advertising exchange or the Ad-IX ecosystems. Ad-IX wins include expansions from -- and MediaMath as-well-as new wins including -- a video advertising platform. ","In financial services our win with BATS who is consolidating infrastructure in our -- campus is generating continued momentum in our financial ecosystems. This ecosystem remains one of our most diverse with over 800 customers across a variety of asset classes, market participants and information providers. We're also seeing positive signs in enterprise sub verticals including energy, oil and gas, professional services and insurance as-well-as new ecosystems taking shape in high -- deployment which I will cover in more detail shortly. ","At the heart of our success is the value we deliver to customers through interconnection. From our earliest days Equinix has focused on building communities among companies who gain business benefits from connecting with each other in a private, secure and high throughput manner. ","As shown on slide 4, we've evolved our interconnection portfolio in response to customer demands and now offer the industry's most comprehensive suite of interconnection solutions. Cross connects or point-to-point fiber connections that delivery secure high performance connectivity between customers and represent the core of our interconnection business generating 85% of our interconnection revenue. ","Today we've approximately 132,000 cross connects and these connections continue to grow with IT traffic increases which is indicative of the power of interconnections and a sign of the strengthen of our ecosystems. Operating in tandem with cross connects and also fueled by IT traffic growth are the various exchanges we run in over 20 markets around the world. These exchanges enable one-to-many connections and like any exchange the value to an individual customer is driven by the number and quality of participants on that exchange. Companies continue to select Equinix as the most efficient and effective place to exchange traffic. ","Our exchange drives over 2.5 terabytes of traffic across 2,200 ports which is twice as many as our closest competitor. Traffic in our exchanges continues to grow over 20% yearly as network, content and cloud customer take advantage of the -- systems across platform Equinix. Combination of large scale exchanges available via both IP and Ethernet protocols and extensive private interconnection inside our IBXs has established Equinix as the global interconnection leader and interconnection remains at the heart of our strategy going forward. ","Let me shift gears now and cover the cloud market and the Equinix opportunity. Cloud adoptions continues to ramp creating massive disruptions in how businesses consume IT services and creating significant opportunity for Equinix. We're experiencing a dramatic increase in traffic within the data center as enterprises leverage virtualized infrastructures and move data and applications into hybrid cloud architectures. ","Platform Equinix is the home of the interconnected cloud delivering critical hubbing functions where customers seek to achieve rapid time-to-market, reduce capital and lower costs associated with directly accessing public cloud services while simultaneously enabling access to their private cloud. In fact -- index we formed projects that cloud traffic within data centers will triple over the next four years. Enterprises are eager to realize the benefits of the cloud but have significant concerns about relying on the open Internet for business critical applications and data. ","With the need for higher performance, security, and control Equinix is seeing customers move critical data and applications off the public Internet taking advantage of the ability to directly connect to major cloud service providers such as AWS where they can achieve significant throughput performance gains. ","As depicted on slide five, the tremendous choice of networks and cloud service providers available on platform Equinix has uniquely positioned us to deliver to enterprises the flexibility they need to confidently extend their networks and take full advantage of hybrid cloud. ","As shown of slide 6, the proximity advantages of platform Equinix allow companies to move beyond really adopt or use cases like test and developments and empower forward thinking CIOs to leverage the cloud for mission critical workloads. These CIOs understand that latency is critical to application performance and many enterprises are reconfiguring their infrastructure to deploy hybrid cloud allowing them to retain control over critical data and enhancing application performance. ","In fact at Equinix we ourselves have deployed a cloud optimize architecture globally to support our own enterprise by connecting to over 40 cloud services. Blending them with our own premise applications to create a hybrid cloud architecture optimized to run our business. While still early in the adoption curve we're seeing more-and-more businesses adopt this next generation IT architectures and leverage our performance hub offer to extend their enterprise, when to increase performance and lower costs. Enterprise wins this quarter include Lego, - and a leading aerospace and defense contractor. ","Cloud and IT services remains our fastest growing vertical delivering 15% year-over-year revenue growth. We continue to win business from -- cloud and network customers including a global deployment with Verizon in 15 markets and Microsoft offering its express -- services in 16 Equinix markets. ","Today we're extending our leadership with the announcement of the Equinix Cloud Exchange. An advanced interconnection solution optimized to support today's cloud workloads. With Cloud Exchange Equinix is building upon its interconnection heritage to bring together cloud providers and cloud consumers in a new way to realize the benefits of cloud computing. ","Turning to slide 7. The Equinix Cloud Exchange extends the investment end and functionality of our Ethernet exchange to enable private secure connections between enterprises, networks and cloud service providers. With this solution enterprises can access multiple cloud and network vendors through a single port interface allowing them to quickly and efficiently deploy hybrid cloud infrastructure. ","The Equinix Cloud Exchange enables IT workloads to be virtually provisioned in an automated fashion over a single physical port between multiple parties simplifying and improving integration, security and performance of cloud services. The cloud exchange is supported by a portal which allows CIOs and their infrastructure teams to interact with the exchange in a variety of ways including -- the list of cloud service provider locations by metro and region and self-provisioning virtual circuits to participating providers such as AWS and Microsoft. Available globally in 13 markets today the Equinix Cloud Exchange is expected to be available in 19 markets by the end of the year. ","As we continue to focus on solutions for enterprise customers building hybrid cloud environments we expanded our alliance with Microsoft to offer -- route the Equinix Cloud Exchange in 16 markets spanning four continents. This removes many of the complexities and capacity limitations associated with setting up network connections to -- cloud service and enables enterprise customers to take full advantage of the cloud. ","We're very excited about the benefits that Equinix Cloud Exchange offer our customers and its potential to strengthen an -- robust ecosystem of cloud and network service providers, delivering services to enterprises. We believe our position as the world's leading interconnection company underpinned by our strong ecosystem of 975 networks, 450 cloud service providers across more than 100 IBXs makes us uniquely qualified to be the home of the interconnected cloud. So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. ","Keith D. Taylor ","Thanks, Steve and good afternoon to everyone. So let me get right into today starting with our bookings. We had a strong growth in net bookings quarter in each of our regions. Better than our expectations and the Americas delivered it's high export bookings activity on record reflecting the importance of our global platform. Also we delivered against both our revenue and EBITDA objectives. More specifically interconnection revenues continue to outpace overall revenue growth increasing by 15% over the prior year with very healthy gross additions for both our cross connect and exchange port offerings. ","On a particular note exchange ports added in the quarter doubled across each of our three regions driven by network, content and social media customers. We continue to expect MRR per cabinet yields to remain steady allowing us to meet our targeted operating objectives and financial returns. ","Now looking at slide 8 from our presentation posted today. Global Q1 revenues increased to $580.1 million a 3% increase over the prior quarter and up 12% over the same quarter last year. Our Q1 revenue performance reflects that $2.5 million negative currency effect when compared to the average rates used in Q4. And a $400,000 negative currency effect when compared to our FX guidance rates. It's important to note that our FX hedges that we set against the Euro, Pound and Swiss Franc exposure offset the positive FX rate that you may have seen this past quarter by $1.1 million. ","Non-recurring revenues increased 14% quarter-over-quarter as we continue to provide customer sales orders and installation activities for our customers slightly greater than our expectations. We expect the custom sales order and installation activity to remain at a higher level for the rest of the year. Total cash cost of revenues were consistent with our expectations and cash SG&A expenses increased to $135.4 million for the quarter including approximately $10 million of REIT-related cash costs. ","Total adjusted EBITDA was $260.4 million above the top end of our guidance range although down 1% over the prior quarter primarily due to fluctuations in salaries and benefits and anticipated higher REIT -- costs. Our adjusted EBITDA was 45%, our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance reflects a negative $1.6 million currency hit when compared to the average rates used in Q4 and a $700,000 negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. ","MRR churn was consistent with our expectations at 2.3%. As we noted last quarter we expect our Q2 MRR churn to increase. Our current estimate for the quarter is approximately 3%. This increase is solely attributed to the LinkedIn churn as they bifurcate a portion of their infrastructure at the end of Q2. ","Given the LinkedIn churn will occur at the end of Q2 the MRR churn will be recognized in Q2 but the revenue impact will be felt in Q3. As mentioned last quarter this MRR churn has been fully contemplated in or 2014 guidance. For the full year 2014 we expect MRR churn to average approximately 2.5% per quarter therefore we expect lower churn in the second half of the year. ","Now moving on to our comments on our REIT. We continue to progress with our plans to convert to REIT on January 1, 2015. While we're still awaiting a response from the IRS on our PR request we do not expect to delay to this time frame. On slide 9 we summarized the various expected REIT-related cash cost and taxes. In the second quarter we expect to incur approximately $11 million in REIT-related cash cost. For the year our estimated cash tax liability is now expected to range between $145 million and $200 million. ","Turning to slide 10. I'd like to start reviewing our regional results beginning with the Americas. The Americas region delivered solid regional gross booking and exported a record level of activity to the other two regions. A testament -- to the success of our global footprint and service offering. Consistent with our expectations the Americas revenues increased 2% over the prior quarter and up 9% over the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis. ","Moving to the Americas adjusted EBITDA but first a reminder. The Americas region continues to be fully burned with the corporate functions including corporate projects such as REIT conversion and -- customer one. Given this Americas adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis was down 6% over the prior quarter and up 5% year-over-year. Americas adjusted EBITDA margin was 45% for the quarter. ","The sequential decline in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the partial reversal of our 2013 corporate bonus approved in Q4 and the -- reset in Q1 as-well-as higher than typical utilities expense due to the harsh winter across many parts of the U.S. We expect the Americas adjusted EBITDA margin to trend back to our Q4, 2013 level effectively 49% as we progress through the year. Americas net billing cabinets decreased by 100 in the quarter -- due to timing of customer installation and cabinet churn a similar phenomenon to what we experienced a year ago. ","While our MRR per cabinet remains steady at very attractive levels. Americas added 800 net cross connections in the quarter slightly lower due to our suite migration in our New York -- asset located in 111 8th avenue. ","Absence of one-time events in the quarter Americas cross connect adds were above the four prior quarter trends. Equally important we added 106 exchange ports in the quarter which is more than we added in all of 2013 driven by demand from content network providers reflecting the competitive differentiation we have with our Equinix exchanges. Interconnection revenues as a percent of the regions recurring revenues increased over 20%. ","Now looking at EMEA please turn to slide 11. EMEA revenues on a normalized and constant currency basis were up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 19% year-over-year and reflect strong performance particularly in the UK and Netherlands as large multi and cross regional deals continue to benefit the region. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 4% over the prior quarter and up 24% over the same quarter last year. ","Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 42% despite a number of one-off adjustments booked in the quarter. Absent these adjustments EMEA adjusted EBITDA would have been 44%. EMEA interconnect revenues increased 9% over the prior quarter and up 36% over the same quarter last year largely driven by the UK market to provide us our large increase in exchange port and fixed antenna service offerings. We added 1,300 net cross connections in the quarter and net cabinets billing increased by approximately 800. ","We continue to expand in Europe progressing with our next phase in Amsterdam - . Located in -- Amsterdam -- is one of the world's most modern locations and designed to new standards and sustainability. ","And now looking at Asia Pacific please refer to slide 12. Asia Pacific revenues were $98.6 million. Revenues on a constant currency basis increased 7% over the prior quarter and up 15% over the same quarter last year, driven by strength in our content cloud and network segments. ","Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis was up 10% over the last quarter and up 6% over the same quarter last year. MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis remained strong and cabinets billing increased by 900 compared to the prior quarter. We added a record 1,500 net cross connects in the quarter and interconnection revenues remained at 12% of the region's recurring revenues. ","In 2014 we are expanding across all seven Asia Pacific metros which include the recently opened phases In Tokyo and Sydney. For new builds we are proceeding with the second phase of our new IBX in Osaka driven by strong interest from the cloud and content customers as well as expanding in Singapore with an additional bay in Singapore too. ","And now looking at the balance sheet please refer to slide 13. We ended the quarter with over $1 billion in unrestricted cash and investments on our balance sheet. Our current liquidity position continues to remain healthy. Our net debt leverage ratio increased slightly to 3.1 times our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA. ","We also repurchased 732,000 shares for $127 million of Equinix stock through last Friday. Our stock repurchase program has offset at least in part this year is attributed to the convertible debt exchange agreement we entered into last week. ","Now switching to slide 14. Q1 operating cash flow increased over the prior quarter to $171.7 million. Even though our DSOs increased to 33 days in the quarter, a trend we expect to reverse in Q2. For 2014, we continue to expect adjusted discretionary free cash flow, excluding REIT-related cash costs and taxes ranged between $620 million and $650 million and adjusted free cash flow to be greater than $200 million. ","Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 15. For the quarter capital expenditures were $105.9 million including ongoing CapEx of $44.9 million, below our current guidance due to timing of cash payments. We opened four new IDX phases in the first quarter including Dallas 6, which is a new build. We now currently have 12 announced expansion projects underway across the globe of which 10 are campus builds or incremental phase builds. ","At this point let me turn the call back to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Okay, thanks Keith. Let me now shift gears and cover our outlook for 2014 on slide 16. For the second quarter of 2014 we expect revenues to be in the range of $594 to $598 million. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between a $135 million and a $139 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $267 million and $273 million, which includes the $11 million in costs related to the REIT conversion. ","Capital expenditures are expected to be $165 million to $175 million, including $60 million of ongoing capital expenditures. For the full year of 2014 we are raising revenue to be greater than $2.395 billion or greater than 11% year-over-year growth, which includes $7 million of positive foreign currency benefit compared to our Q1 guidance range. ","Total year cash gross margins are expected to be 69%, cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between $530 million and $550 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be greater than $1.105 billion which includes $3 million of positive foreign currency benefit compared to our Q1 guidance range and also includes $37 million in cost related to our REIT conversion efforts. ","We expect 2014 capital expenditures to range between $550 million and $650 million, including approximately $200 million of ongoing capital expenditures. So in closing we are off to a strong start in 2014 and are well positioned to deliver profitable growth while continuing to invest and innovate to fully realize the benefits of our global interconnection platform. We sit at the heart of the rapidly evolving digital economy and are the only data center company that brings together an extensive global footprint in the existing relationships with thousands of network, cloud, constant and enterprise customers. ","Hybrid cloud is emerging as the clear IT architecture of choice for service providers and enterprises alike and we see this as a unique opportunity to capitalize on our market leadership. We will continue to invest in this opportunity by building next generation interconnection solutions and building a robust cloud eco-system that will meaningfully increase the inherent long term value of the business. ","So let me stop here an open it up for questions. Rachel I'll turn it back over to you. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. And our first question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Please sir you have an open line. ","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research","Thanks. Two questions. First if you could just go through the sales force and the size and the productivity and just -- areas of strength. And then I am looking at the sources of weakness within it. And then as well I'll just follow-up -- to the second question, please. ","Stephen M. Smith","","Okay. Mike I'll start out and we can pile on here. So generally speaking from a sales and bookings productivity standpoints. There is good steady state productivity and as you guys that we've said in the past quarters the ramp is bi-vertical. But we do have a high level of competitiveness going on particularly we're staying very disciplined in our deal reviews as you guys see in our MRR per cabinet results. ","We do still believe there is upside as our reps continue to mature and we get better at our offerings that we're expanding as we talked about today we become more adept at -- the enterprise and as the cloud unfolds. So I think the team believes there is still more upside for the reps around the world. So overall there is a lot of positive momentum from our exit rate in fourth quarter and certainly the good start we had here in this quarter. ","We haven't talked a lot about this but Charles has probably reported this we're augmenting our direct sales force which is around 220 to your specific question, Mike to-date -- heads in the direct sales engine. We starting to augment that with an indirect channel that we're starting to sell through and with platform partners and resellers as-well-as working with some referral partners to help generate new leads. There is a lot of activity going on both the direct and indirect front that total headcount on -- heads will probably go towards 240 maybe up to 250 as you think about full year into the year. ","So as Keith mentioned in his script we had very good results first quarter across the three regions. Actually in Americas they have the gross bookings since Q4 of '12 and as he said they had very good export bookings. And actually in the other two regions we exceeded both our growth in net bookings planned. So really good results in the quarter pipeline healthy, coverage ratios look good, conversion rates are up. So generally speaking sales engine is doing very well. ","Keith D. Taylor","","Yeah, Mike Charles had said to your question about performance across verticals. Good consistent performance again both regionally and vertically. I think particular strength as we've noted in the script and associated with the cloud opportunity and continuing the scale. Enterprise as we had said in the past little longer sales cycle we're really seeing some significant lighthouse wins continuing to see those and beginning to ramp and implement those in ways that are delivering the benefit to customers which we now intend to kind of repackage in the case study to push back out through both our direct channel and our partner channel that we think will accelerate that opportunity. ","Pretty good solid performance across the verticals and across the regions and again really strong performance from a global perspective. ","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research","And let me just follow-up with the second question. On the REIT side you said there wasn't an uptick on the PLR but have you learned anything new from your advisor or the process, is there any further details on timing or expectations that you may have that you could share with us this evening?","Stephen M. Smith ","Well not allowed Mike but as Keith said in his script we're full speed ahead with all the system and process work to drive us towards that conversion of January 1, 2015. So as all of your probably saw over the last couple of weeks there was a good news with -- and CBS -- getting -- launch. And so with PLR starting to be issued that obviously is good to see that -- broken. But we don't have any specific update other than the IRS has informed us that it's actively working our PLR request and will respond in due course. So we don't expect as mentioned in the script any delay in the ruling on our PLR and we're full speed ahead towards 1-1-15. ","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research","Thanks very much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan [inaudible]. Okay, sir you have an open line. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, I thought you did a great job of laying out sort of the density of the cloud platform that you are pulling together and how it could attract enterprises. We are hearing more and more about sort of the similar types of approaches from other folks and it seems like everyday somebody announces a connection to the platform or connection to AWS, and so I was wondering if maybe you could give us a little bit more perspective in terms of why somebody would be drawn to your cloud platform versus some of the others and then in terms of how you go in and get to the customers. Is this an outgoing call or is this sort of a responsive call in terms of putting out the offer to customers. ","And then I did have one detail question, just to make sure I understand the linked in churn, it looks like it's about the bumped churn by 50 bps relative to MRR or the recurring revenue base, it's $2.5 million or $3 million worth of impact in the third quarter. Thanks. ","Charles J. Meyers","Yeah, I'll start with the front part relative to the cloud opportunity, agreed there is a lot of energy in the market, I think that people are -- lot of enterprises looking to capture the benefits of the cloud and I think there are a lot of people chasing after that. But what is very clear is that hybrid cloud has emerged as the IT architecture of choice. ","And I think specifically to your question as to how -- what we do is differentiated the reality is that in order to capture those benefits the geographical reach of our platform the network density of the platform, the cloud density that already exists inside our centers with the 1,200 plus cloud service providers and 450 plus pure play cloud providers represent a very unique value proposition in terms of being to access that cloud density, to be able to get to the right network providers across the globe that are needed to generate the global reach that these customers need, to reach their end users. So I think it's a very differentiated opportunity. ","In terms of the go to market there is probably a ways we will go to market today, a strong focus on continuing to direct basis go after the light house accounts that we think are going to be the thought leaders in the industry and are really going to drive through incremental demand from others who are looking to follow their lead. So that's happening on a direct basis. And we do that both direct and from an outside and an inside perspective. So there is calling activity that we marry up with our field force for an inside outside type of approach which is pretty common in this type of go-to-market design. ","And then we are beginning to ramp the channel and there are a lot of companies out there that have extensive reach into the enterprise and as we make these offers like network performance and cloud exchange more channel ready we will push those into those partners and there's simply no way that we are going to achieve the market penetration that we want in terms of reaching enterprises with 230 odd quota bearing heads across the globe and so ramping that channel up and putting the offers into the hands of partners is going to be credible. ","So that is the first part now I will let Steve or Keith take over.","Stephen M. Smith","I'd add Jon to the question to what Charles said, I think he had it dead on but I'd add that one of the differentiators of the fact that we have an exchange platform deployed in 20 markets, almost 20 markets today. So other people are talking about building something, we are extending and enhancing our current Ethernet exchange fabric to just address this multi-cloud, multi-network feature requirement that we are starting to see. ","So we are going to drive to a higher level of interoperability, we are going to have portals, we are going to have self-provisioning, we are going to have API development, so there is a lot of development going on underneath the requirements that we are getting from these big announcements that we are making. So the Verizon and the AT&Ts and the Microsoft and AWS requirements are driving us to develop a much higher level of capability that just doesn't exist in the market. ","So I would tell you there is real differentiation because there is real capability out there today that we are just enhancing that doesn't exist with many of the other competitors. So Keith if you want to add\u2026","Keith D. Taylor","And Jon then on the linked in just to give you a perspective, so in Q2 is going to add roughly 70 bps to the churn. So absent linked-on our churn would be roughly 2.3%. At least that's our estimate for this quarter. And so on an average basis for the year it would take the average from 2.5% per quarter as I said to roughly 2.3% per quarter. From a revenue perspective\u2026","Unidentified Analyst","That's really helpful, thank you. ","Stephen M. Smith","","Okay. Good. ","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Sir you have an open line. ","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","Hi. Great. Actually I had two somewhat similar questions. As it relates to the cloud exchange is that technologically than your Internet or Ethernet exchanges or something out there that is just a rebranding effort. And then as part of that are you considering actually connecting your facilities not just within a region which I think you already did but actually from region-to-region to potentially have more of a distributed network architecture that some of those enterprises might want. ","And then as it relates to LinkedIn and Keith sounds like you're going to say something out but I'd love to hear what that was but also just from a metrics perspective I was wondering if you could kind of us give us a sense how many cabs or cross connects we should think about so you can properly model this into our models? Thanks. ","Stephen M. Smith","Yeah Colby I'll start and let others jump as well. The absolutely the cloud -- represents an incremental technology investment on our part and much more than expansion or rebranding. As Steve indicated essentially we're building off of the existing Ethernet and Internet exchanges by beginning to integrate those exchanges and have invest significantly in terms of ATI development to really allow for interoperability automated provisioning, circuit provisioning on a realtime basis et cetera. ","So there is a lot of investment that goes in well beyond what we've in the Ethernet exchange platform. So we're excited about that and there are actually future extensions of the technology that we will look forward to sharing at our Analyst Day in June that will give you a better picture of things. So very exciting and now we're getting really great response from our customers already. ","Charles J. Meyers","And Colby on the second part of your question. I was going to mention just dealing with the revenue aspect of LinkedIn, so as I said this is really going to affect us in Q3 not really much in Q2. So the impact of losing that piece of the business is roughly $4 million for the quarter and the Q3 quarter. Then on a range as it relates to sort of the cabinets think of it in the order of magnitude of sort of 500 to 600 cabinets but they were dense cabinets. And so when you look at it on a pricing basis it's relatively rich MRR for cabinet number over that 500 to 600 cabinets. ","Now all those 500 to 600 cabinets I'd tell you that we've already ear marked replacement customers for all those cabinets, they have not billing yet, they have been identified and allotted the capacity but we've not yet provisioned or sold them out -- contraction. And again those are very high -- dense cabinets that we had deployed in LinkedIn. ","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","And any cross connected impact on it that we should think about it?","Charles J. Meyers","To be quite open typically when you see a deployment of that magnitude is very typical to see much density from a cross connect perspective. There is certainly going to be some cross connect but if the on the margin inches it's not going to move in any direction. ","Stephen M. Smith","Yeah that's right, it's empowered ends but not air connection done. ","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","Great. Thank you. ","Stephen M. Smith","I did miss one piece of your question Colby relative to connectivity inter region connectivity. All I'd say is that I think we actively are looking at how we continue to deliver connectivity between our assets in a way that's responsive to the customer need. And so obviously we look at that more or so at a metro level first and then within the region. But what we want to be able to do is make sure that as companies deploy with us on a global basis which by the way the script talked about 86 of our top 100 customers deployed across an average of 10 metros globally. ","That means that what they want to do is deploy in a place that fits best with their needs but be able to gain access to the services, cloud service providers, networks et cetera that they need more globally. So that's going to require us to continue to assess our connectivity in our interconnection portfolio. But our initial focus is more on the metro and within the region. ","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Mr. David Barden of Bank of America. Sir you have an open line. ","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey guys. Thanks. So Keith I guess my first question is just on the guidance typically is but if I look at the midpoint of the second quarter revenue guidance and I added to the first quarter and then I subtracted from the full year guidance. The implication is that the third and fourth quarters will grow revenue assuming no currency changes about 15 million per quarter. Last year you had currency headwinds that were fairly strong and you grew revenue each quarter in the second half 18 million on average. ","Are there any reasons to believe that your ability to generate revenue the second half of this year is currency neutral less than your ability to generate revenue in the second half of last year on a sequential basis? And then the second question if I could just kind of I know if touched on it couple every times. But I think may be Steve or Keith just generally speaking if you kind of looked for the soft spot and result it was North American cross connect slows down MRR is flat down on tiny amount the billable cabinets went down. And it just looks like basically North America didn\u2019t grow in the first quarter. ","So kind of can you read this that it is growing and that it will grow and little support kind of giving to your guidance for the year? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor","","Sure. So let me take the first part and David then I think Charles will step in and talk a bit about America that we can plan on accordingly. I think it's first it's important to know that when we strip or way all that sort of one else in the currency in Q1 we originally guided to roughly 2.1% at this point of guidance in Q1 2.1% growth rate coming at Q1 when you adjust for currency you adjust for sort of one of nature of you may have some custom fills order worked in the first quarter. We really adjust we grew by 2.6% , so when I think that and that includes the midpoint of that a Q2 guidance being 596 million. ","When I adjust for currency I take out the impact of the Q1 custom sales orders recognize we\u2019ll get some we still get some in Q2. We are going to go back to roughly by 2.7% that leads me than to grow we are going to go for the rest of the year and more to your point what\u2019s your question.","Clear there is a couple of things number one we increased our guidance and then reflect to three things. Number one our currency was working on a favorite for $2 million to $7 million as you know. Secondly we had not paid in our performance in Q1 and so we took that to the bank in addition we had a three incremental million dollars per quarter for the later three quarters of our guidance period year. They give you $50 million and then commit for guidance this quarter. I want to note though we said this is going to be greater than 2395. ","And so when you draw the relationship to how we are going to perform this year versus last year we are deploying if you will the same strategy we think we can do better than that with the one point that I want to make. When you think about the latter half of the year the second half of the year guidance it is going to be impacted by the link insured in it is going to happen one tail school. We get -the entire Q2 quarter of LinkedIn revenue but we will lose that benefits starting at the beginning of Q3 and so you feel that impact very much like Asia Pacific did with the large content -- that last time Q1 of last year so they sort of separate through that one. ","So my general pointing is that we feel good about 23 then 2395 I think it reflects an opportunity to continue see some upper growth in the back half of the year despite what I\u2019ve just said. ","Charles J. Meyers","Yeah this is Charles I\u2019ll take the question relative to the North American business. What I would say is that essentially if you look at the metric in the three you mentioned specifically are on cash billing cross connect adds and yields of cabinets. I think you are seeing a confluence of events that impact the measures and it really doesn\u2019t reflect I think the health in trajectory the business overall. We are pretty we are very comfortable it is continuing to grow yield continues to be at very attractive levels. Casual filing as you see if you look at the external metrics tracking to see it's we had the same kind of phenomena a year ago where we had a debt of about an almost identical and debt of about a 100 cabinets. ","And as we\u2019ve said that and have said a number of time it's really a matter of the timing of installs and timing of turn that really make that metric a bit more valuable. So it's not something that we believe is a cause for concern, there is probably some effect there associated with some strategic wins that we\u2019ve had towards the end of last year and in Q1 that are probably on slightly longer ramps that affects our book to bill a bit but again we don\u2019t see it as a fundamental degradation of the house and format in trajectory of the business. ","I mean relative to cross connect adds also very much a series of kind of one-time events, some known grooming that occurred and then specifically as we mentioned us having to move out of the suite in the now Google owned 1-11\/A, which is a very inner connection dense facility and required a lot of migrations of customers to different suites, a process that is ongoing but if you take out those one-time events we are actually above the fourth quarter trend on cross connects for the Americas and again feel very good about that. ","And you add to that our court volume which has accelerated extremely well over the last couple of quarters and we feel like there is a strength to the business there particularly on the interconnection side continues to be very good. Bookings were solid for the regional bookings and extremely strong for the exports. So again we are seeing good overall production from the team and we expect the Americas business to continue to be competitive and perform well. ","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks guys. Appreciate it. ","Operator","Okay, our next question comes from Mr. Gray Powell of Wells Fargo. Sir, you have an open line.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo","Great, thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple if I may. So on the passage you guys have put up some very good cloud customer case studies, like Four Square and Box. I am curious, do you see an increase in pace of demand from companies that grow up on the AWS, hit a certain maturity level and then co-locate with Equinix to improve performance. And then without getting too customer specific, how big can a cloud customer's deployment with you be, relative to their total infrastructure needs?","Stephen M. Smith","Why don't -- I will take the first cut at that and then you guys can jump in. Absolutely we see a trend towards customers that are attracted early on to the sort of variable costs trying to ramp the time to market benefit that public cloud implementation can offer. But typically those that begin to scale rapidly find two things, one that the economics of public cloud at a certain utilization levels begin to become sort of burdensome and substantially less attractive than going with full [pay model] and putting their own infrastructure in place. ","And number two they struggle with the customization requirements or their ability to customize and respond to the evolution of their application in a public cloud environment. As a result almost inevitably what they move to is a hybrid cloud environment. They leverage, they continue to leverage the public cloud particularly for university type workloads or efforts where they are unsure about the growth or performance of an application and they often started out in public cloud and then move into a hybrid cloud environment. ","So that's absolutely something that we see. We expected that trend will continue. And then relative to the size of the deployment it is -- I would say in fact we commented that our average size deployment in Equinix is coming down. And that is because people generally are going to one, even within a colocation or an owned infrastructure environment are moving to multi-tiered architectures and they would typically put their network nodes and their service nodes which are, where they need the network density application performance et cetera inside of Equinix facilities and then may locate larger footprints implementations elsewhere where they can get substantially more aggressive rates. ","And then you combine that with moving beyond multi-tiered architectures into true hybrid cloud. And I would say that we are going to see more sort of small to mid-size implementations but we are going to see a couple of factors that go with that. One they are going to be multi-metro, multi-region and as we said that is very frequently 8, 10, 12, 15 locations globally, number one and number two they tend to be more inter-connection dense and therefore perform better from a yield per cabinet basis. ","And so that's really the essence of our strategy that improves customer retention. It is really the strategy that we believe is going to allow us to continue to mitigate churn and grow both the top line and the bottom line. ","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo","Got it, that's all.","Charles J. Meyers","Greg, I'd add one point to that, obviously I can't share with you our top customer activity but if you just look inside our top 10 customers half of those customers today are almost pure cloud type workload deployments and it's just -- and it's going to get bigger and bigger. So if you worry about EPS and how big can these deployments get about names of customers some of this -- from our biggest customers is almost peer related work load. So it is really shifting. ","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo","Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. Just a modeling question if I may. So if look at your footnotes and just back out great OpEx in 2013 and 2014 EBITDA guidance. Margins last year would have been just over 47% yet the footnote saying they guide for 2014 implies 48%, should we think about that a 48% as sort of a starting point when looking out into 2015?","Stephen M. Smith","I agree as we said on last call we actually we see ourselves -- back of the year we should be getting up to this sort of that level of margin. Recognizing obviously would -- two major programs by that point. I am just -- how the costs are going to fall in 2015 is probably a little bit premature but certainly gives you a pretty good indication of what we think we can do entering 2015. And so I feel pretty good about that level of guidance. ","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo","Okay. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Mr. Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Sir you have an open line.","Frank Louthan IV - Raymond James","Great. Thank you. On the bookings can you quantify and give us an idea of kind of where they have been trending and where the upside was. And then looking at some of the non-recurring revenue a little bit higher and we're looking for it does that imply a kind of better growth from installed maybe later in the quarter that we should expect some revenue from how should we think about that trend?","Charles J. Meyers","Yeah -- I think we saw as I said earlier our bookings performance was pretty consistent. So it wasn't like we had pockets of weakness in particular really saw good pocket of strengthens we did see a continuation of the trend in terms of strength on the cloud side and we saw solid performance across the regions as Steve indicated. And again without giving detail we don't normally give we would just simply say that we delivered against our internal targets and felt very good about the bookings quarter overall. ","And from an MRR perspective yeah we absolutely are seeing an interesting trend which is we've become we've tried to focus very much and saying look how can we meet the install requirements in some of the other custom -- requirements of our customers. As a way not only to capture that revenue but as a way to be a more holistic trusted advisor to those customers. And so we see it very much as win-win it is incremental revenue process but a less attractive margin than our normal MRR but nonetheless very strong from a contribution perspective and something that continues -- some improve our account position with the customers overall. So as we said it seems to be going very, very well and we see that continuing throughout calendar year. ","Stephen M. Smith","If I could just add. I'd say that two regions that sort of benefited the most was the Americas roughly $- million of net benefit in the quarter that we recognized 50% of that would be I am sorry $1 million of that would have been in the Americas and roughly $2 million in Asia Pacific related to more specifically to Singapore environment. So that's where the sort of the $3 million uplifts had come. Again as Charles alluded to we tend to get lower margins on that type of business but it is very attractive business to us and that's reflected in our results. ","Frank Louthan IV - Raymond James","Yeah. Thank you. ","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Mr. Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Sir you have an open line. ","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Company","Hi. Thanks guys. Two questions from me. Steve you alluded to the environment is really intense. Is the intensity increasing or do you think it will sort of decline a little bit what are you seeing from the open Ethernet exchanges -- at this point? And then I just want to follow-up on the cloud. ","Stephen M. Smith","Could you repeat the first part of that question I didn't. ","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Company","Oh, sorry. Is the competitive intensity increasing or decreasing at this point has it peeked or you think it's the supply that's kind of hitting the market is that slowing down at this point?","Stephen M. Smith","Well certainly varies by region. We're significantly advantaged as you heard us talk about -- global requirement -- consistency. But the competitive intensity is heavy it's heavy in Europe, it's heavy in a metro certainly it's been more capacity that's come on board last two, three, four years. And so yeah we're competing for pretty much everything. But where you see a requirement, require multiple metro and multiple region types of port we start to find ourselves in significantly advantage. But I mean you have to go market by market to give you the competitive intensity texture it really varies market by market. ","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Company","Well then this is inverse or is it fairly stable. ","Stephen M. Smith","Probably stable I think the big -- tab in the last couple of years and is predominantly wholesale and I think we talked about that as expensively over last several quarters around the larger footprints there is much more wholesale capacity out there. But the type of retail network mutual global capacity that we bring on to the market still has put us in a very, very good position for the type work we need mission critical global footprint connectivity type issues are I think we are still in a big advantage there. ","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Company","Thanks and then as sort of hope on clouds much for that looks like great opportunity. Two questions there one do you think there are going to be dozens of different cloud providers are going to want to connect to this exchange you know everyone talks about the top two or three. But what you are seeing out there from others? And secondly IEE and bunch of others are trying to work on cloud standards kind of standardize storage and then processing definitions to make things more interoperable. And are you going to try that will enable more standardization and more if your operability is it really just more focused on the network connectivity? Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith","Well Charles now take a quick at that. So on the standards certainly one of the requirements we are seeing out there is a requirement for common interfaces to drive the interoperability as you referred to it. So there is a clear opportunity for us with our cloud exchange to simply that interface for customers coming in with very complex requirements and we will do that to elute it to the earlier question that came out. And so yes there is there will be standardization driven not much different then we saw thirty years ago we went from mainframe to many and then we went to client serve and then we went to the desktop. ","The next shift is cloud as a -- shift and there is going to be standards in common interfaces and methodologies and all kinds of things that are typical with the technology -on ships so yes and we will help associate that. ","Charles J. Meyers","Yeah and like to hit on two other portions of your question. One I don\u2019t there will be dozens I think there will be a 100\u2019s cloud service providers in fact there are already as we said we have 450 plus service providers in our environment today. And the number of them they will in the evolution of our technology platform which you get we will share further in June is that we are going to have we are going to integrate them in a way that is going to allow access to all of those post to be after participate in the exchange. And if you look at even us as a relatively modest size air price we already today access over 40 cloud service providers and use them as part of our overall IT infrastructure be our own hybrid cloud. ","And so we have talked to customers' larger enterprise customers global multinationals to literally count the number of product service providers they are already using in the 100s. So we think it's well beyond that and will be a multi 100s of providers that are involved and even a much larger number of participants. And then the other thing that you mentioned briefly but I talked about that with at some link in the last call entering some of the reasons as why we feel very comfortable with our position there. ","And I guess what I would say is we continue to feel like we are highly differentiated. And if you look at the results in terms of the port volumes that we are driving through the pipeline I think the results are really big for them in terms of the competitiveness of that platform.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Company","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. And our next question comes from Mr. Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Sir you have an open line. ","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. So I do want to ask what\u2019s driving the growth and exchange force is the customer profits is changing is the pricing driven are you repackaging the products and lot of it's predates to your cloud exchange announcement from this mornings. I am just interested in kind of the some of the moving parts there round the mix shifts. And then you had some bills leadership transitions in Germany and at China and I look I you kind of give us an update on what\u2019s happening in those markets.","Stephen M. Smith","Always -- I\u2019ll talk first relative to the Open IX not to the RIX force in that momentum there. Its combination factors really I think it's one the continued growth of the number of testing\u2019s on that and the value prepositions that delivers to those customers. And as we have said before we continuously asses the pricing and of our products in the market and so there has been some adjustments pricing allows us to continue to be extremely competitive and I think just overall those are probably the key factors that have really driven that. ","And I think there is a demand side in fact some demand side factors as well which is some of the evolution over the top and other things that are driving interconnection and connectivity requirements for both our actually just increasing the appetite for IT traffic exchange. And so there is a demand side phenomena we're meeting that up with continued investment in the platform as-well-as ensuring that we remain competitive from a price standpoint and that's really serving us well. ","Charles J. Meyers","And on the second question particularly in Germany. We have a whole new team we're very stabilized in that market now we have new leadership country management level sales operations and in the finance part of the organization. So jobs \u2013 on that front I think this leadership team here has high expectations that, that business will get back on track record that what we've experienced in past years. So we're very stabilized there, very impressed with the new leadership team and it's heading in the right direction and had a very good quarter. ","And then you asked about Shanghai we did put a new leader in Shanghai and he is just getting started but high hopes and \u2013 the executive growth in that market we're starting to see in the MNC activity pickup and we're actually starting to find some business in the local market there which was unexpected. So I think we have also high expectations that we will continue to scale that business. ","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. ","Operator","Okay. Our final question comes from Mr. Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Sir you have an open line. ","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks a lot. Thanks for fitting me in. You talked about the BATS win again, can you give just give us some sense of what's that in Q1 or what's the timing and any sizing around that. And just generally on \u2013 headlines around the high frequency trading can you just drill down on your financial services segment how much is sort of electronic trading, how much is high frequency related? Thanks. ","Stephen M. Smith","Yeah. Let me start and Charles then you may fill in some holes. On the BATS win, Simon significant wins for us as we mentioned in the comments today. The momentum has picked up around that deployment that's happening in our \u2013 campus. And we're starting to see BATS deploy, we're starting to see a lot of activity from customers that are going to connect into that. So it's really picked up the momentum particularly in the \u2013 campus. So big, big win for us with that assets. ","On the high frequency front we're in a position given that we're servicing so many different clients and as you guys know we're up over 800 financial services clients of which I think a 150 or so are due to the exchange trading venues. We're significantly advantaged here because of the multiple asset classes and geographies and trading styles that we covered today with all the different client bases. So we're not suspect to any one part of that having regulation put in. ","So we feel pretty good about that I think we're going to remain trading \u2013 so we're helping these companies not just take advantage of trading faster but trading smarter. That approach is definitely being successfully as we're seeing we're buffering ourselves so many downturn in any specific market instrument asset class or trading style. So we're in a good position there and the diversity of the client base is an advantage and quantitatively it's roughly 1% of our global revenue could be \u2013 as high frequency trading type on business. Very difficult to have full visibility of all the trading styles and we don't have any of them in our top 50 customer. ","So it's very little impact to us at the end of day but we're working with all these companies to try to help them satisfy the requirements the regulations as they come down. ","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","That helps. Thanks. ","Charles J. Meyers","Little more color on the timing of BATS. Well, all I'd say I give you more information then \u2013 will comfortable with the areas they are consolidation their infrastructure and they have noted that publicly. And as a result I think we're going to see sort of series of opportunities for momentum where we can continue to consolidate our parties into our ecosystem. And so we're seeing that now in sort of the first wave very have had some great wins already, the funnel is building nicely. And again it's one of the factors contributing to our confidence about the remainder of the year and our to the adjustment of our guidance. ","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Thank you.

In the interest of wrapping this call up in an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. This marks our 49th quarter of consecutive revenue growth, delivering both revenue and adjusted EBITDA significantly above the top end of our guidance ranges as demand for interconnection continues to drive strong performance in all three regions.","As depicted on slide three of our presentation, despite strong currency headwinds, revenues were $643.2 million, up 1% quarter-over-quarter and up 11% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $305.7 million for the quarter, up 4% over the prior quarter and up 17% year-over-year, delivering a 48% margin. AFFO grew 28% year-over-year, $221.8 million. We continued to experience strong momentum, delivering solid gross and net bookings and healthy fundamentals, including firm MRR per cabinet on a currency-neutral basis, low churn and strong margins.","I'm extremely proud that we were added to both the S&P 500 and the FTSE NAREIT indices, reflecting our scale, REIT structure and the important role that we play in the technology infrastructure industry. We're also working closely with the other REIT indices as we begin our journey in this new category. This is our first quarter reporting as a REIT and we are evolving our methods to the market as we diversify our shareholder base. We believe that many of the characteristics our traditional investor base find attractive about Equinix will translate well into the REIT domain, including our unique portfolio of assets, solid stabilized asset growth, and a long history of success with new development.","We continue to roll out incremental financial data to enable our investors to track and analyze our business, including adding disclosures around NOI, NAV and owned assets. These new segments of revenue, categorized by stabilized, expansion and new, and by owned versus leased, highlight the diversity and strength of our offers. They also demonstrate how our ecosystems in interconnection translates into strong NOI, stable pricing, and recurring and predictable bookings and returns.","We now have over 6,300 customers around the globe, which includes 1,400 customers from our ALOG acquisition, which we now have integrated into our metrics. Today, 68% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed in more than one region, up from 65% last year, and 82% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 80% last year, demonstrating the extraordinary strength of our global platform.","Revenue from interconnection grew 17% year-over-year, and we added 5,500 cross-connects this quarter which takes us up to over 155,000 cross-connects across Platform Equinix. Customers in our network, content and cloud verticals are strong drivers of interconnection growth, and we're also seeing growth in interconnection from the enterprise. Cross-connects from enterprise companies to all other verticals has ramped over 30% year-over-year growth. Also, our Internet exchange traffic grew over 65% year-over-year and in response to the robust demand for high-bandwidth connectivity, we are now offering 100-gigabit port speeds to complement the 10-gigabit increments that customers have historically purchased and continues to deliver the industry's most complete interconnection portfolio.","This quarter, we opened five new flagship data centers, boosting data center and interconnection capacity in the financial and network hubs of London, New York, Singapore and Toronto as well as a new metro in Melbourne, Australia. We now have 105 data centers across 33 markets, the largest global retail data center footprint, offering more than 11 million gross square feet of capacity.","Given strong fill rates, particularly from cloud providers expanding in Tier 1 metros, we are moving forward with expansions in critical markets. The majority of our development pipeline for the year is focused on campus expansions and augmenting existing data centers, which helps drive operating scale and improves predictability of returns. The stability of our business model continues to deliver attractive growth on our new developments and our stabilized assets, which are tracking to over 33% yields on our gross PP&E investments.","We continue to increase the number of owned data centers, including the addition of London-6 this quarter, and owned properties now generate 37% of our recurring revenue and 39% of our NOI. Many of our owned facilities are in high-demand metros, including Amsterdam, Ashburn, Frankfurt, London and Silicon Valley, and we expect NOI contribution from these assets to continue to grow as we expand in these markets and selectively pursue asset purchases in other key markets.","This quarter, we invested $38 million to acquire four acres of land next to our Silicon Valley campus, which provides important expansion opportunities for this highly interconnected metro. In Ashburn, with the final expansions of DC10 and DC11 underway, we expect to start developing Ashburn North, a 44-acre plot purchased in 2012 that we intend to build out over the next seven years. Over time, we expect more of our organic growth to come from owned properties as we build out these core campuses.","For the newer REIT investors, business ecosystems inside our data centers are at the heart of our strategic operating model and a significant differentiator for Equinix. Ecosystems are simply communities of customers who derive value from locating in the same data center to connect to each other to achieve greater application performance and simplify network architectures. The interconnection created as an ecosystem growth generates higher returns for our sites and increases in value to our customers.","For example, some of our more mature campuses, where ecosystems are established (7:55) are the most profitable and differentiated, and we typically build new assets adjacent to these sites to capitalize on this value while de-risking our returns. Strong interconnection exists in each of our major metros and sites including those in Singapore, Frankfurt, London, Chicago, New York, Ashburn and Silicon Valley, having over 10,000 cross-connects. About 94% of our co-location square footage is in a metro with at least 1,000 cross-connects or more.","Now let me shift to the quarterly highlights of our top ecosystems. Our high network density continues to create significant interconnection opportunities for a myriad of industries and is driving strong network-to-network cross-connect demand, as service providers use Platform Equinix to extend their networks and generate new revenue. Our new IBX in Melbourne is a testament to this opportunity, with more than 17 global network providers already committed to deploying in this data center. We are also enabling network service providers to deliver new cloud services by leveraging both the Equinix Cloud Exchange as well as traditional fiber cross-connects.","Mobility remains a fast-growing sub-segment in the network vertical, with mobile providers, including Lycamobile, T-Mobile, and Truphone joining this emerging ecosystem. For the content and digital media industry vertical, we continue to attract top content magnates that are expanding across multiple regions. Our advertising sub-segment is thriving, propelled by the shift away from traditional advertising towards digital and mobile advertising, placed by transacting on digital exchanges, resulting in a rich and fast-growing ecosystem. Content and digital media companies are also contributing to significantly \u2013 to the parent traffic on exchanges, as well as driving growth in interconnection.","Turning to our financial services vertical, we are expanding our electronic trading business across new geographies and asset classes. Wins include OANDA, a leading Canadian foreign exchange broker that is an ecosystem anchor in our Toronto 2 data center, and BATS, one of the largest equities operators in the U.S., that's expanding in London in addition to consolidating its U.S. matching engines at our Secaucus campus. Further, we continue to see progress as we diversify our financial services business to insurance, retail banking, and digital payment collectors. We have won several anchors in the emerging electronic payments ecosystem, including a key win with the largest pan-European credit card payment process.","Turning to cloud and IT services, this vertical delivered strong bookings, driven by new wins and expansions with AWS, Cisco, Datapipe, Oracle, and T-Systems. We are excited about how the cloud opportunity is playing out, and we have another quarter of significant progress as cloud service providers choose Platform Equinix to support rapid global deployment. The Equinix Cloud Exchange, our interconnection switching platform that enables companies to connect directly, securely and dynamically to multiple cloud and network providers, continues to scale and now has over 120 participants and is live in 20 markets globally.","Turning to the enterprise vertical, we are seeing strong momentum as enterprises move beyond the exploratory phases of cloud and are beginning to re-architect their IT infrastructure to capture the significant cost, flexibility and security benefits of hybrid cloud deployments. We are seeing strong response from both customers and channel partners through our Performance Hub offer, a solution that distributes an enterprise's data center infrastructure across multiple locations to accelerate application delivery and enable efficient secure access to key network and cloud services. Over 130 customers have deployed the Equinix Performance Hub solution, and this quarter, we saw strong growth in existing deployments as well as critical new logo wins.","Notably, this quarter marked one of our largest channel deals to date, as we were able to secure a key infrastructure deployment with one of the world's largest providers of athletic apparel, the result of a highly successful joint sales engagement with Datapipe, one of our leading global partners. Other enterprise wins this quarter include BRB (12:00), a sporting goods retailer; Pella, an automotive component manufacturer; NetHealth UK (12:08) a healthcare company; Red Lobster, an American restaurant chain; Ryder, a transportation and supply chain management provider; and Valmet, a supplier of services for paper and energy industries.","Expanding our global channel program is a top strategic initiative for Equinix, and we are investing significant resources to ensure our partners are well-equipped to deploying compelling IT and cloud solutions for their end customers via Platform Equinix. Along with technology partners, AWS, Cisco, Google and Microsoft, other companies that have recently joined the channel partner program include ABT (12:40), Datalink and Unitas Global.","So, let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Great. Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone.","Well as they say, the only thing better than a strong Q4 and a recurring revenue model is following it up with a strong Q1, and our Q1 results represent a great start to 2015. Our global interconnected platform continues to deliver strong gross and net bookings and this drives leverage across each of our regions. Our key operating metrics remained solid, such as net cabinets billing, MMR per cabinet and the MMR churn rate. And our interconnection trends remain very positive too, both nominally, but more importantly, the value that they bring to the health of our ecosystems.","Interconnection revenues now represent 17% of our global recurring revenues, a 17% year-over-year increase with strength across each of our regions. Also, our key operating margins continued to improve. Each of our gross profit, cash gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and operating profit experienced a nice step-up this quarter. The result, a strong revenue pull-through and lower than planned costs.","We remain pleased with our performance, while consistent with our comments from the last earnings call, we do plan to continue to invest in our go-to-market strategy and other key initiatives through the end of this year. Yet, given the success of the first quarter, as Steve will discuss shortly, we're now able to increase our adjusted EBITDA guidance on a currency-neutral basis by $17 million for the year. So, one additional comment before I get into the earnings slides; we're very pleased to have completed our first quarter operating and reporting as a REIT and of course, this includes the issuance of our first quarterly recurring cash dividend. We continue to expect to receive our favorable PLR in 2015 and look forward to sharing the news with you when received.","Now moving to the slides, as depicted on slide four, global Q1 revenues were $643.2 million, up 1% quarter-over-quarter and up 11% over the same quarter last year. We're now in our 13th year of consecutive quarterly revenue growth. Our revenues' over-performance was due to a number of factors, including favorable net pricing actions and higher than expected custom installation activities.","Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, absorbed a $9.5 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates last quarter and a $1.5 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. Although currency volatility across all of our operating currencies continues to cause significant FX headwinds, we put in place net cash flow hedges covering greater than 80% of the value at risk related to our EMEA operating currencies. This provides for a smooth flight path into 2016.","Global cash SG&A expenses decreased to $145.3 million for the quarter, primarily due to lower-than-planned advertising and promotion expenses as well as the one-off sales commission expense incurred in Q4 due to the change in our internal policy. We expect our cash SG&A expenses on a quarterly basis to remain roughly flat for the rest of the year.","Global adjusted EBITDA was $305.7 million, up above the top end of our guidance range and up 17% year-over-year. This was driven by stronger-than-anticipated cash gross margins, the result of lower-than-expected utility rates, and the favorable FX hedges in EMEA. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48%. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $800,000 currency impact when compared to our average rates used last quarter, and a $3 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance range.","Global net income was $76.5 million or diluted earnings per share of $1.34, a strong step up from last quarter which was impacted by the write-off of our deferred tax assets due to the reconversion and a loss in debt extinguishment related to our Q4 financings. Our Q1 operating cash flow increased over the prior quarter to $232.8 million, largely due to lower cash interest and taxes, and a reduction in our net working capital position. Our Q1 MMR churn was below our expectations of 1.9%, although including ALOG we'll be reporting 2%. We continue to expect our quarterly MRR churn rate to be at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% guidance range over the remainder of the year.","And one final note before I just discuss the regional performance. Our non-financial metric sheet is now fully consolidated including ALOG, with one exception. We do not include ALOG revenues in our MRR per cabinet metric, given the level of managed services in the revenue line. Also, as part of the Equinix Customer One initiative, we've upgraded and automated our inventory tracking systems. Also, we've globally standardized the cabinet equivalent definition and as a result we have updated our cabinets billing by utilization at our MRR per cabinet metrics, including the comparable periods to incorporate this change. As you can see, this change left our operating trends intact.","Now turning to slide five, I'd like to start reviewing our regional results beginning with the Americas. The Americas had a strong revenues quarter, the result of favorable net pricing actions, lower-than-planned MRR churn and an 8% quarter-over-quarter increase in our non-recurring revenues, largely the result of increased custom installation activity. Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 4% over the prior quarter and 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, largely due to strong cash gross margins offset in part by the higher seasonal FICA charges. Americas interconnection revenues now represent 22% of the region's recurring revenues, and we added 1,800 net cross-connects. Americas' net cabinets billing increased by 1,200 in the quarter, and we added 85 exchange ports in Q1, which included the sale of our first six 100-gig ports.","Now looking at EMEA, please turn to slide six. EMEA delivered another strong quarter, with particular strength coming from our Dutch and German businesses, although FX continued to impact our as-reported results. Revenues were up 5% quarter-over-quarter and 19% year-over-year on a normalizing constant-currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA, on a normalizing constant-currency basis, was up 13% over the prior quarter, and 28% over the same quarter of last year largely due to a 17% quarter-over-quarter decrease in SG&A, the result of a strong U.S. dollar and the $3 million hedge benefit. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 46%, although normalized for the FX benefit, adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 44%.","Due to strong traction in our cloud vertical, including momentum from our support of large cloud providers, like Azure and AWS, we had another solid quarter of cross-connects adding 1,500 net cross-connects in the quarter. EMEA interconnection revenues represent 9% of the region's recurring revenues. EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant-currency basis. Net cabinets billing increased by 900.","And now looking at Asia-Pacific, please refer to slide seven. In Asia-Pacific, we had record gross and net bookings this quarter. Revenues were up 4% over the prior quarter, and up 25% over the same quarter last year on a normalizing constant-currency basis, driven by strong sales momentum in cloud and IT services, enterprise and network verticals. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and a constant-currency basis was up 6% over the prior quarter, and 30% over the same quarter last year, largely due to a 4% decrease in Q1 SG&A, the result of a strong U.S. dollar and lower-than-expected discretionary spending.","Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 50%. MRR per cabinet, on a constant-currency basis, was up 2% quarter-over-quarter and cabinets billing increased by 900 over the prior quarter. We added a record 2,200 net cross-connects. Interconnection revenues remained at 12% of the region's recurring revenues. Now as we continue to scale our APAC business, we have eight expansions currently underway across six metros, including new phases of our newly opened IBXs in Melbourne and Singapore. Also, given the success in the Sydney market, we're now proceeding with the building of our Sydney 4 asset to capture this opportunity.","And now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to slide eight. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and our net debt remains consistent with the prior quarter. Our net debt leverage ratio decreased slightly to 2.9 times our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA, the result of stronger operating performance and a higher-than-expected cash balance at the end of the quarter. A significant portion of this cash will be consumed throughout the remainder of the year, largely from the payment of our quarterly dividends and special distribution, the funding of our capital expenditures, and the payment of liabilities on our balance sheet. We continue to have a tremendous strategic and operational flexibility built into our balance sheet and capital structure. This allows us to continue to plan for growth and meet the funding needs for our shareholder distributions.","Now switching to AFFO and dividends on slide nine, for 2015, we now expect AFFO to be greater than $830 million, or growing 15% on a constant currency basis, the benefit of a strong operating performance and a decrease in our planned net interest expense. Our AFFO payout ratio decreased slightly to 46%. Also, as noted previously, we paid our first regular cash dividend and expect to announce our Q2 dividend shortly.","Important to note that the taxable income from the QRS part of the business ultimately drives the dividend payout requirements. As you may appreciate, there isn't always a direct correlation between AFFO and our REIT taxable income. As an example, AFFO represents a global consolidated metric, whereas the REIT taxable income solely relates to our QRS entities. We continue to expect to distribute 100% of our QRS's taxable income.","Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 10. For the quarter, CapEx was $150.1 million, including recurring capital expenditures of $22 million, lower than our guidance range, primarily due to timing of cash payments. As presented on the expansion tracking slide, we currently have 19 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 18 are cabinets builds or incremental phase builds on over 15 markets. We continue to believe that spreading our capital expenditures across multiple regions in phases is the best way to invest in our growth. These 19 projects will increase our current inventory by 10%. We expect our recurring CapEx to remain consistent with our prior expectations of $115 million.","Turning to slide 11. The operating performance of our stabilized 76 global IBX and expansion projects that have been open for more than one year continued to perform well. Revenues were up 6% year-over-year and we continue to enjoy healthy yields on the stabilized assets, reflecting the premium value that is placed on these assets. Currently, these projects generate a 33% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested and are at 84% utilized on our recalibrated available inventory capacity.","So before handing the call back to Steve, I would like to remind you that we've appended our supplemental financial and operating data deck to the earnings presentation starting on slide 16. There are a number of incremental disclosures including details related to how we segment our business between expansion and stabilized assets over our owned and leased portfolio. Of note, you'll see that our cash gross profit grew 14% over the prior year, our adjusted cash NOI increased 15% over the prior year to 61%, and our corporate cash SG&A as a percent of total revenues decreased to 9%. And finally, we provided you with the key components to our NAV on slide 30.","So now, I'll turn back the call to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Keith. Let me know cover our 2015 outlook on slide 15. For the second quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of $654 million to $658 million, which includes $6 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to average Q1 2015 rates and normalized in constant currency growth of 3% quarter-over-quarter. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $144 million to $148 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $304 million and $308 million, which include $5 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to average Q1 2015 rates. Capital expenditures are expected to be $210 million to $220 million, which includes approximately $30 million of recurring capital expenditures.","For the full year of 2015, we are raising revenues to be greater than $2.635 billion or a 13% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis. This guidance includes $25 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to prior guidance rates. Excluding this negative impact, the revised revenues is a $30 million increase compared to our prior guidance.","Total year cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $580 million to $600 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to be greater than $1.23 billion or a 47% adjusted EBITDA margin. This guidance includes $7 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to prior guidance rates. Excluding this negative impact, the revised adjusted EBITDA is a $17 million increase compared to prior guidance. We expect adjusted funds from operations to be greater than $830 million, a 15% constant currency growth year-over-year, effectively a $26 million raise adjusting for currencies. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $740 million and $800 million, which includes $115 million of recurring capital expenditures.","So in closing, our strong results this quarter reflect the continued strength and momentum in our business. The global reach of Platform Equinix along with unparalleled network and cloud density and thriving business ecosystems positions us to solve the many challenges faced by today's CIOs. The strength and uniqueness of our global platform is translating into solid operating performance and the importance of our reach is evidenced by the rapid growth of customers deployed across multiple metros and regions. Our disciplined execution of our strategy continues to drive momentum as we strike a balance between revenue growth, margin expansion, yield and attractive returns on our invested capital.","So, let me stop here and open it up for questions. So, I'll turn it over to you, Leslie.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we have our first question coming from the line of Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Sir, your line is open.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much and good afternoon, folks.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Amir.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was wondering if you could talk a bit about sort of margin progression here. I mean obviously, there's been a lot of puts and takes: the conversion to the REIT reinvestment and supporting channel expansion. Obviously, if we look at particularly on adjusted basis with your EBITDA guidance there is a tick-up in expectation. Just trying to think about sort of how the longer term progress margins are particularly when we look at sort of where your longer term targets were and how we should think about the trajectory and the ability to get that level?","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","I think it's a great question, Amir. I mean so, most fundamentally we're very much committed as a company to driving towards our 50% EBITDA margin target or better and clearly, we showed a little bit of momentum when we issued our guidance at the first part of this year assuming when you adjusted for currency. And then coming out of the first quarter, we're able to moderate that up slightly as well. So very pleased with the direction in which it's going. I'd tell you though as you sort of step back, Q2 \u2013 in my comments I said, look, SG&A you should expect it to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. So, as a result, what I think you're going to get as you sort of progress through the year absent some of the timing issues that we're going to see in Q2 is a bias towards an upward trend through the latter part of fiscal year 2015. And that positions us very good as we go into 2016.","My only comment would then be to continue to look at and assess where we need to make investments and to the extent that we can create value and further the business opportunity we have in front of us, we'll continue to make those investments. So I don't want to pre-commit to where 2016 will be, but suffice it to say the direction is very, very positive as we exit 2015.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So perhaps a quick follow-up there; if we think about 2016 then from a directional perspective, given some of the moving factors that have impacted you folks in \u2013 or expected to impact you folks in 2015, should we expect that sort of directional upward bias?","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","We certainly believe there's an upward bias, but again we want to reserve the right similar to what we did this year. We took some of the money that we were going \u2013 that we were in fact saving from the REIT project and we decided to put it back into the business because it made infinite sense to go invest in our go-to-market strategy and all the components around that. Again, as we look into 2016, we'll make that decision as we get closer to time but my message to you would be right now there's an upward bias as we exit the year.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much for the incremental color.","Operator","Thank you. And we have the next question coming from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut. Sir, your line is open.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions, two if I may. First, in terms of the revenue outlook for the year, given the 1Q report in the midpoint of the 2Q guide implies a fairly slow ramp in the third quarter and fourth quarter, I don't know, maybe $11 million or $12 million sequential net revenue growth. So I was just wondering if there's any sort of churn or other things in that number as we look out the remainder of the year that should \u2013 that we should be aware of? And then as a second question, you've had another strong quarter of bookings here, and I'm wondering if you might update us on sort of your visibility, level of confidence and so looking into the future, commencement lag, things like that, that allow you to raise the guide for the remainder of the year? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Good questions, Jonathan, let me take the first one and then I'll perhaps pass it to Steve or Charles for the second. I think first and foremost when you look at our guide for Q2 on a revenue basis, when you adjust for currency, so take out the benefit of the hedge that's sitting in revenues in Q1 and you adjust for basically the forward exchange rate, you're looking at about a 3% quarter-over-quarter increase. And so we're happy with where we sit with Q2. As we look into Q3 and Q4 similar to what \u2013 as we came out of last year, we're less comfortable in predicting the amount of non-recurring activity that we have in the latter half of the year. And that's what we experienced this quarter.","Part of the reason for the over-performance is we saw \u2013 we did more non-recurring activities than originally anticipated. And I'd tell you that we hold that \u2013 we're holding that path forward, sort of bypass through for the latter part of the year as well. That coupled with the fact that there is some seasonality in, just in our booking activity. So there's a little bit of churn that we know that's forthcoming and yet I feel very comfortable with the 2% to 2.5% range and probably biased more towards again the lower end of the range, but relative to where we've come from we'll have slightly more elevated churn in the latter part of the year based on what we see.","And then the last part is just timing, timing of when we install, and there's a recognition as we roll out our global, our global systems. Like anything, that can create some level of drag and we're just being a little bit conservative right now, until we actually roll those out and start operating it, if you will, with those new systems. Americas is May; Europe is going to be in the July timeframe, and so we're going to go through that implementation cycle.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Jonathan, let me start and Charles might have some comments here to add on to this. But on the bookings question and visibility, as you heard from the comments today and from the previous quarter, we've had a very good start, strong start to 2015. And you see the results in increasing top-line guidance for 13% year-on-year constant currency growth. And across all the industry verticals we're seeing very good activity. We've got good coverage ratios. The pipeline is strong. We're holding yields across all three regions. The impact of the investments that we've been talking about with channel professional services, the innovation that our marketing team is doing with our product, the enterprise awareness activities, the sales enablement stuff, so all the investments that were bundled into that $20 million message we gave you last quarter, are all taking hold, and you can see the results showing up across all industry verticals. So, Charles, you may have a comment or two to add to that?","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","No. I think you hit most of the key ones from my perspective. I would say that one of the things that is not evident; we did make some adjustments to our sales structure and territory alignment and account allocations in the first quarter, which inevitably creates a little bit of drag. And yet, I think we powered through that, delivered strong results. And the objective of that alignment was really to ensure that we continue to capture the momentum that we're seeing in the cloud ecosystem overall, both on the supply side with cloud service providers, and on the demand side, if you will, or the buy side with enterprises. And those two verticals are generating about 60% of our new logos, continued strong momentum in bookings and new wins there, and as Steve said, the key metrics like funnel size, conversion, rep productivity, book-to-bill interval, all looking solid.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jonathan.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much, and thanks a lot for the new disclosure. It's very helpful. I'm looking at page 25, the same-store operating performance and you've broken out the stabilized and expansion. As you mentioned earlier, the stabilized return on gross PP&E was 33%. The expansion is 19%, up from 15%, a nice year-over-year improvement. Perhaps you could just talk us through how the 19% evolves over time. Is that tied to utilization and is it reasonable to think that that becomes 33% over \u2013 or something else, four years or five years in, gets up to that sort of stabilized level? So any color around that would be great.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Simon, just so I'm making sure that you and I are looking at the same thing, so when you're looking at the percent growth year-over-year, when you talk about the 19% in the expansion, is that what you want us to refer to?","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","It's the cash return on gross PP&E, the last column on that page.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Okay. Generally from our perspective, I think there's a couple of things. Clearly, as you think about our stabilized assets, again those are assets that have been \u2013 all phases have been open for more than one year, and effectively that one year for us is January 1 \u2013 starting January 1, 2014, looking at that relative to the expansion activity. Our sense is when you think about expansion, because an expansion could be two, three and, in some cases, four more phases, you can appreciate that the net sort of the drag, if you will, perhaps taking on that full obligation whether it's a lease, whether it's the land and other related costs. Until you get more to more fully utilize, you're not going to get the economic return that you're looking for relative to a stabilized asset. So as a result, this is a path, if you will, that's very consistent with our expectation, recognizing there's a relatively large portfolio of assets. There's 31 assets in the expansion bucket. They're going to be at all different levels of delivery, if you will.","And so probably leaving it with you, I think you're going to see that number move up and towards the 33% as we continue to pass time and then fully utilize those assets. And the other thing I'd leave you with is the team has done a very good job over the years recognizing stabilized assets are only 84% utilized, the team does a very good job of optimizing the assets. So not only do I continue to expect the expansion to move up, quite openly we also expect the stabilized to move up into the right as well.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, the only color I might add to it, Simon, is that I think there's \u2013 if you look at the mix of the stabilized asset group there and the expansion asset group there, there would certainly be no reason to believe that the long-term performance would be meaningfully different since they're likely to have similar mixes. And so it's just a matter in some cases if they're very large, large-scale projects, it may take a longer period because they're multi-phases of investment but would trend towards that endpoint.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we have our next question coming from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Sir, your line is open.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Good quarter. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two if I could. Just, Keith, number one on the dividend, obviously we don't see the QRS or kind of have a picture of where the growth trajectory for the QRS which is going to fuel the dividend growth is. Could you kind of address what we should be expecting on that front and whether you have an appetite to reflect the QRS growth in a quarterly or annual fashion in the dividend? And then the second question on the balance sheet, we've dipped now below the long term leverage target; if you went back to the midpoint, we could buy back 5% of the stock. You've been very cautious about using the balance sheet as you kind of went into the reprocess, because there were obviously reasons to kind of be cautious and keep dry powder, but what can we expect Equinix is going to do for shareholders in terms of using that balance sheet on a go-forward basis? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Two very good questions, David. Let me start with the dividend. I think first and foremost, as you know, when we issued our dividend at roughly $1.69 per share on a quarterly basis and we said annualize that at $6.76 per share, or roughly a 3% yield where the stock was trading at the time, and so we're very, very comfortable with that, recognizing this is the transitional year for us as a company, transition in the sense that we're being very mindful of the assets that should be inside the Q and those assets that sit outside in the T, primarily to limit the amount of taxes we pay and certainly at the same time meet the REIT requirements. So what I would like to leave you with at least for 2015 is right now make the assumption at least for next quarter that we're going to hold things stable.","As we look forward, as you think a little bit about the assets that sit outside of the Q, so you have Canada, Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, which are the big four, that's going to give us the flexibility to change, if you will, the dynamics in what that dividend will be, in addition though to effecting the growth. It's fair to say that a lot of the assets, particularly Europe, which most of Europe sits inside the Q, that's going to continue to grow. And as we said on a currency adjusted basis it grew 19% this quarter over same quarter last year, and all of last year grew at 21% over the prior year. So we're very confident and comfortable that we think that there's going to be good, if you will, growth in the Q, so that that allows us to continue to manage, if you will, the dividend on a go-forward basis.","As it relates to balance sheet, you're absolutely right. It's \u2013 we sort of anticipated that this question might be forthcoming. Part of the reason I put in disclosure is that a good portion of the cash that sits on the balance sheet, the $1.1 billion, just from what we see today a good portion of that's going to get fully consumed. And that's effectively \u2013 we consume almost \u2013 for all intents and purposes, that reflects one turn, if you will, of net leverage. And so from our perspective, if we consume that capital, which we \u2013 or cash, which we intend to, our leverage is going to get into a much more, it'll get within the guidance range that we have shared with you.","And then the last piece I would tell you is to the extent we always \u2013 it's fair to say we always think of highest and best use of our capital, and right now given the success that we're seeing in the business, if anything you're going to see more of a bias towards continuing to invest in our future, which means investing more in the capital expenditure side of the equation and less about maybe some of the other alternatives we could use with the cash.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, Keith.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Sir, your line is open.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two if I could, one follow-up and an additional question. So when you're talking about I think the utilization of the stabilized assets and the opportunity to increase utilization on the expansion assets, where do you see the long-term utilization for stabilized assets? What's the mature level that you think on average each asset can get to? And then secondly, if you could talk a little bit more \u2013 at the beginning of the call, I think, Steve, you mentioned that part of the revenue growth in the quarter was based on some favorable pricing. I'm curious if you can go into little bit more depth as to where you saw the pricing and maybe what was different about this quarter maybe relative to the last few quarters in terms of the pricing commentary? Thank you.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","So let me take the first one, then I'll pass it to Steve and Charles for the second one. As it relates to stabilized assets, right now as I said we're at 84% utilized. I think for all intents and purposes we would target between we think 90% or greater, and realistically somewhere between 90% and 95% is a realistic assumption that we should be able to drive our utilization level to. I think that's an area of comfort, Michael, that over a period of time recognizing some of these assets we're very selective in how we fill them up. And what I mean by that, if it's a network dense asset and we don't have a lot of incremental capacity, we're willing to let that asset sit there for a period of time looking for the right customer with the right application to go into that asset. And so once we get there, I think it's reasonable to assume you're 90%-plus utilized.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And on the revenue growth and favorable pricing, Mike, I'll just give you a little color, and maybe Keith and Charles might have something to add. But I mentioned in my comments in the beginning that yield across all regions continues to be strong, and actually, our global yields was up $40 or 2% quarter-on-quarter on a constant currency basis. So that was roughly 0.5% in the Americas, 2% in Asia and Europe, so pretty strong pricing in the regions, primarily because of the focus that our sales and marketing teams have on targeting specific workloads and focusing our value propositions around that type of application workload. And as \u2013 historically as we've always mentioned, blended in with that, where appropriate we're pursuing larger magnetic footprints that are helping the overall ecosystem value. And you should expect us to continue to compete for those, that'll advance our cloud agenda, but generally speaking we're doing a very good job of qualifying and bringing the right types of workloads into the right locations, and that's served us very well from a churn perspective and that's served us very well from a MRR per cab, and we expect it to remain firm, going forward.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","Operator","All right. Thank you. And our next question is from Jonathan Atkin from RBC. Sir, your line is open.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. I wonder if you could comment on M&A, just given some of the recent news around (47:04-47:09) and then, thinking about kind of the European Telecity Interxion situation. Any reaction from your customer, any commercial changes that you're seeing (47:18-47:23)?","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jonathan, we did not hear all of that. I think I have the gist of your question, which was to comment on M&A and the activity we see around the world. Is that the gist of it?","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. M&A, and then specifically whether your European business is seeing any impacts from the pending deal going on in Europe between Interxion and Telecity.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure. Sure. I'll start and maybe Charles, you might \u2013 if you have anything to add, please jump in here. Fair to say, guys, that we have our eyes on the same consolidating activity that you're all reading about in our industry. We're still focused, as I mentioned last quarter, on our inorganic strategy to extend our current leadership position around cloud and network density, secondly around scaling our platform, and then third around enhancing our interconnection position. So we're always evaluating options to accomplish those three objectives, and we'll continue to do that. And if there was a transaction that might complement that strategy and create significant shareholder value, you should feel confident that we'll consider it.","But in terms of our Europe business, we're continuing to be very pleased with what's going over there. And our results off last quarter and certainly this quarter, as we mentioned in previous calls, our business in Europe grew 21% last year. And on a first quarter year-on-year basis grew 19% in this first quarter. So our European business, because it's connected to a global platform, is growing faster than the broader EU market. And as you also heard we have significant momentum on interconnection in Europe. So all in all, yes, we're watching this stuff and our business in Europe we're very happy with.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then on the cloud growth, I'm interested, is that becoming more indexed towards top five global platforms? Or is that more diversified or becoming more diversified to smaller cloud operations?","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Charles, do you want...","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","I'll take that, Steve. I think it's a combination of those things. We certainly see strong momentum with I would say the top six to eight cloud providers that I think you would immediately think of. And they are \u2013 most of them are deploying now with us in anywhere from 8 to 16-plus markets around the world. And we're seeing significant activity, not only in their deployments but I think more excitingly cross-connect activity and Cloud Exchange activity driving interconnection back to those clouds from within our facilities, which is really the essence of the sort of building the cloud ecosystem. And so \u2013 but then we also are really seeing good new logo capture and growth with existing new logos in a bit more of the longer tail around cloud service providers in a variety of forms.","And so I think it's both, and I think both are really critically important because I think that what we're seeing is that those big magnets like an Azure or an AWS are often the catalyst for somebody to say, yes, I need high bandwidth secure connectivity into these cloud providers as I begin to move workloads into the cloud. But then they \u2013 as they evolve their hybrid cloud they really want access to a much broader range of cloud services as quickly and cost-effectively as possible and the ability to seamlessly and efficiently move workloads across various cloud providers. So both seeing good momentum and both critical to long-term health of the ecosystem.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","All right. Thank you. And we have our last question coming from the line of Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Sir, your line is open.","Tim K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. Do you expect the average size of the customer to keep getting \u2013 maybe start getting smaller at this point as you move more to the enterprise market? It seems like you've kind of focused on the major cloud providers the last couple years, building up the cloud exchanges and, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm assuming enterprises are now starting to use you guys to connect to these exchanges. And I guess have we hit the tipping point with enterprises? Thanks.","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, I'll start, Steve, and if you or Keith want to jump in. I would say yes. I think that the business will trend that way over time. I wouldn't say we've reached a tipping point per se in that I think we have a lot \u2013 are in the very early innings of enterprise adoption of hybrid cloud. But again, we're seeing good momentum. Our lighthouse accounts are showing very strong land-and-expand type performance with some of our key customers, starting with two to three locations and rapidly expanding in their Performance Hub implementations to 6, 10, even 20 sites.","And so what I think we will see is an extremely favorable trend for us, which is average deal size for a new \u2013 or average implementation size perhaps trending somewhat down, although balanced in part by the fact that we're going to continue to selectively pursue strategic large footprint type activity where it's really accretive to the strategy. But I think, we will see average implementation size trend down as we really gain some traction in the enterprise, both through our direct force and our channel. But interestingly, I think that the \u2013 we'll begin \u2013 we'll be able to grow those customers over time and so see the average billing volume for a customer continue to be strong. So I do think we will see that trend. I think it's a very favorable trend potentially for our yield over time. But I think it's still very early days.","Tim K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We still have a next question coming from the line of Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Maybe, Keith, just a clarification on some of the cost being brought into Q2, which I'm assuming are in the guide. But the utilities, the discretionary spend, and the merit increases, I assume that's all part of the guidance, the $308 million? And then secondly, the interest expense decrease and revised capital interest, can you just give us a little more clarity on that?","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Yeah, Mike, you're dead on. Just as we look to Q2, so not only do we have the merit increases that took effect in March, so we see that, if you will, the cost associated with that moving into Q2 and beyond, we have all the new head count, so all the \u2013 of the new hires. Then we have a higher utility line coming in in Q2 as well. As you know, typically from a seasonal perspective, our highest cost of utility comes in the second quarter and the third quarter in the Americas region. And so we're absorbing roughly another, if my memory serves, it's another $6 million to $8 million of utilities in the second quarter relative to what we were going to spend in Q1.","And then there's \u2013 we're continuing to progress with our integration of the ALOG investment. And so we spent about $1 million in Q1 on the ALOG integration and so we expect to spend more in Q2 also with the rollout of our eco initiative. All that to say is there's some timing and, therefore, that's why you see \u2013 despite that you see some step downs costs that we had in Q1 will be replaced with costs that I just talked about in Q2. And then we think that we can hold our SG&A relatively flat for the rest of the year.","As it relates then to just the net interest expense my reference to the fact that there's a certain amount of interest that gets capitalized into our assets and it was roughly a $12 million change from what we previously disclosed. And because of that, although you see an improving AFFO the real value of the AFFO increase at this stage of the game was the improved operating performance. $10 million was really to capitalization and that, of course, that has no meaning. Even though our AFFO payout ratio goes down, there is no fundamental shift that really took place because that capitalized interest it gets treated differently for tax purposes. So that's the primary reason for the interest step down.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our very last question coming from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen & Company. Sir, your line is open.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you for fitting me in. So I just want to talk about the competitive landscape for a moment. It seems like there's just a lot going on, whether it's some of the wholesale guys trying to offer more retail products, everybody I guess to some degree trying to offer some form of interconnection whether it's with Open IX or their own exchanges, increasing demand it seems like for colocation facilities in Tier 2 markets, even metered power to some degree seeming to squeeze into the sub-500 kW type deals. I was wondering if you could just comment on what if any impact you're seeing from some of these trends that I just mentioned. And then the second thing is as customers do start to ask for more flexibility in what they want from you, whether it's in terms of what we'd refer to as wholesale space or bigger space or perhaps even different power requirements, is it going to require that you start to be more flexible in how you build your facilities? And could that over time change the cost on a per megawatt basis that you're investing when you build out a facility? Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We're seeing all those things, Colby. Charles, do you want to take a crack and I'll...","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I'll jump in, you guys can add color. You're right. Steve's absolutely right. We're seeing all those things at some level, although what I would argue is that continued \u2013 we've said over and over again we're focused on getting the right applications, right customers with the right applications into the right assets. And that really centers around this sort of ecosystem-centric strategy. And so I think if we're disciplined in that strategy I think that we see that the dynamics of the \u2013 some of the competitive things that you're \u2013 that you referenced have a much lesser or more marginal impact on our business. I think that you're right, certainly wholesalers \u2013 some of the wholesalers are indicating a desire to \u2013 and offer smaller footprints and begin to dabble in the retail space.","As I've said on a number of calls before, the requirements to operate a world-class at-scale retail business and the investments necessary to do that are substantial. And I think what we're finding is that customers who really need the application performance, the global reach, the mission critical reliability for these retail-type applications are typically choosing Equinix based on the superior value delivered. And so while I think there's probably some, as I've said, minor overlap between our businesses in terms of workloads that could be pursued by those types of players, if we're consistent and disciplined in our strategy I think we're seeing relatively limited impact.","You mentioned Open IX and a broader desire for people to talk about it and try to offer interconnection. I think that's also true, but I think the substance that we see in the market as compared to the hype and the PR, we see a big difference between those things. And I think we feel very confident that we have a \u2013 the interconnection portfolio in terms of both offers and reach that really is delivering the value to customers. So again, we see very limited impact there. In fact, the momentum continues in our IX, our Internet Exchange offering. We've sold more ports in the last four quarters than we did in the last several years, and really continuing to see incredible strength in that market. So customers are kind of voting with their wallets.","So \u2013 and then to the last question about is our need to and our desire to at least be able to in a targeted way pursue large footprint opportunities that we think are strategic control points, does that modify the way we think about our facilities? I would say yes to some degree, but that and a number of other factors have us constantly revisiting whether or not the design of our facilities and our ability to implement a flexible architecture and one where we can match capital spend as quickly and as closely to demand as possible, that's always an objective of the business. And so we definitely have resources. And in fact, have increased the number of resources we've spent looking at that opportunity. And we think we will continue to evolve the offer to be as just-in-time as possible and as flexible as possible to meet the range of requirements that our customers are asking for.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Charles. Colby, that was very thorough. And I \u2013 the only thing I'd add to that to \u2013 it was a great question because there's a lot of activity going on. I think, as I said in the comments in the beginning today, our strategy is working, you see the results from the firm yield and the other metrics, interconnection continues to grow, we feel like we're executing on all the right items, so you should expect us to continue this, more of the same.","Colby A.

Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. It's good to be joining all of you as we share our strong results for both the quarter and the full year. As I believe everyone is aware, I have assumed the role of CEO for an interim period. I'm fortunate to have held both the roles of CEO and Executive Chairman over my 17 years here at Equinix. And I've had the privilege of working alongside our leadership team, playing an active role in their efforts, our strategy and every major decision the company has made in this time frame. As we look forward, it's our opportunity to accelerate digital transformation and our position as the underlying platform and stewards of our customers' digital infrastructure that has me so excited about our future. I'm thankful that I can play a meaningful role in assuring our momentum continues as we outpace our industry.","Turning to our performance. We just delivered our 60th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, a longer track record than any current S&P 500 company, and we're well on our way to deliver over $5 billion of revenues in 2018. We are investing more than ever before in our organic business, growing our strategy, services and innovation team to support new products and services, adding more quota-bearing sales heads as our business grows and supporting a broader initiative around customer experience.","We continue to grow our global platform, adding 19,000 cabinets across 23 projects in 2017 and have a very active construction pipeline going forward. With more than 9,800 customers, we now serve 46% of the Fortune 500 and 1\/3 of the Forbes Global 2000, with more to come as we continue to attract and add customers, transforming their digital businesses.","Interconnection and ecosystems remain the core of our offerings, and with the Verizon assets, we now have over 277,000 cross-connects and record traffic volumes across our industry-leading exchanges. We have the most complete interconnection portfolio in the industry, and interconnection revenues continue to outpace colocation, growing 14% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis.","Our differentiated platform continues to drive our financial performance, and we delivered another year of record bookings activity. As shown on Slide 3, we generated $4.4 billion of revenue in 2017, up $756 million over the prior year, a 21% increase or up 11% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis.","We delivered over $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA, continuing to achieve healthy margins while investing significantly in the business and expanding our addressable market. This translated into AFFO growth of 14% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, further demonstrating our strong operating performance.","Next, I'd like to provide more detail on the growth of Platform Equinix. Our unmatched global reach continues to be strengthened by our acquisitions, and we remain committed to pressing our advantage globally. In 2017, we completed 5 acquisitions, including the addition of 29 data centers from Verizon. And today, we announced our acquisition of the Infomart Dallas, one of the most connected assets in the U.S., for $800 million.","The Infomart, a marquee interconnection hub for the Americas region, will enhance our global platform and secure our ability to further expand in the Dallas market, one of the largest enterprise and colocation markets in the Americas. The Infomart is home to 4 of our Dallas IBXs and will increase our percentage of revenues from owned assets to over 45% when it closes.","We also signed an agreement in December to acquire Metronode, an Australian data center provider, for $791 million, which is expected to close in the first half of 2018. Australia is one of the fastest-growing cloud markets in the world, and this transaction provides us with an impressive national footprint, adding 10 more data centers in 6 metros. It strengthens our existing presence in Sydney and Melbourne and brings us to 4 new metros in Perth, Canberra, Adelaide and Brisbane.","This acquisition also provides the opportunity to build additional capacity on these majority-owned assets. With the expected close of this acquisition, our platform will expand to 200 IBXs, 52 markets and 24 countries, providing customers with even more ways to securely deploy, connect and scale their digital infrastructure with Platform Equinix.","We also saw great progress with the Verizon assets, which had dramatically boosted our scale and interconnection density in the Americas and outperformed expectations for the year. We are seeing healthy bookings in the Verizon assets from Equinix customers and continue to make progress to stem the previous level of churn. This year, we're expanding these highly utilized assets in select metros, investing over $160 million across Culpeper, Denver, Houston, Miami and S\u00e3o Paulo. We now -- have now completed the majority of the Verizon integration efforts and expect to fully conclude this by midyear.","Shifting to our interconnection portfolio. In December, we announced an important investment in the evolution of our global platform. We are connecting our IBXs physically and virtually around the world through the Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric, enabling customers to discover and dynamically connect to any other customer across any Equinix location. With over 1,000 participants on the ECX Fabric, we will continue to invest in this platform as it evolves beyond pure cloud connectivity to a multipurpose interconnection exchange.","We are also investing to ensure that our interconnection services are consistent, accessible and available on demand across our entire footprint. As part of this commitment, we've announced the expansion of our Internet exchange services to 9 new markets, which will bring our total IX platform count to 31.","Now I'll make a few comments on our organic development activity. As we look across the business, we see a significant uptick in capital expenditures in response to strong underlying demand. With our high level of inventory utilization and a strong sales funnel, we have a very active pipeline for 2018 with 30 expansion projects currently underway across our platform, half of which are in EMEA, our most utilized region. And greater than 75% of this expansion CapEx is allocated to mature metros that generate over $100 million in revenue, where we leverage established ecosystems densities and our large installed base, allowing us to deliver market-leading financial returns.","As previously announced, we're also building an organization that we refer to as HIT or the Hyperscale Infrastructure Team that will focus on developing facilities that are tuned to hyperscale requirements. Today, the majority of private interconnection nodes for the major cloud players are located in Equinix facilities, and we continue to invest heavily in future development and API integration.","Our integration efforts with the major cloud players have provided us with deep insight into the evolving architecture of the cloud. In response to their request for Equinix to be a more full range infrastructure provider, we have committed to accelerate our efforts to serve the large footprint needs of a targeted set of hyperscale customers. We will remain selective in pursuit of these opportunities but believe that participating in this space is important in maintaining and extending our leadership position in the overall cloud ecosystem.","We are leveraging the combination of existing capacity, including a significant Q4 win with a major cloud provider in London, and dedicated hyperscale builds to target a handful of key markets in 2018. Paris 8 represents our first dedicated build for this initiative, and we have a healthy pipeline of other hyperscale opportunities. The HIT team will focus on reducing our cost to build, shortening time to market and executing longer-term customer contracts that will enable superior blended returns.","Now let me cover highlights from the verticals, starting with networks. Our network vertical achieved its fifth consecutive record bookings quarter, experiencing growth across all regions as major wireless and telecom providers expand their capacity and capabilities for digital and as our diverse group of network partners continue to ramp as a critical channel for Equinix to the enterprise market.","Expansions this quarter included AT&T, which launched its SDN offering to rapidly provision and scale dynamic networks across Platform Equinix, and China Telecom expanding its footprint and jointly selling to Chinese multinationals. Equinix is also seeing continued momentum in the strategically important subsea cable space, a market where our position will be meaningfully strengthened by our Itconic and Metronode acquisitions.","In financial services, we saw the highest bookings in 4 quarters with the continued diversification of our customer base beyond electronic trading and including insurance and banking as these critical enterprise segments embrace digital transformation. Customer wins and expansions included a top 50 U.S. bank leveraging Platform Equinix to securely access financial ecosystems as well as a Fortune 500 insurance provider transforming network topology while securely connecting to multiple cloud providers.","The content and digital media vertical experienced continued bookings growth, led by the Asia Pacific region, and an uptick in gaming, e-commerce and publishing subsegments. Expansions this quarter included a Fortune 500 media conglomerate deploying multiple performance hubs to support employee applications as well as Adela Group leveraging our advertising ecosystem to capture new revenue.","Our cloud and IT vertical achieved another record bookings quarter, led by the EMEA region and software and IT services subsegments. Cloud providers are re-architecting their networks, further segmenting traffic with additional access nodes and bringing more core services to the edge. This momentum in our existing base of cloud providers was augmented with key new customer wins, including Agile Defense, Clarity IT Solutions, Coach House Partners and ThousandEyes.","Turning to the enterprise vertical. We saw strong bookings momentum across the transportation, retail and government subsegments and another record quarter of new customer adds. Overall, the enterprise vertical is growing at twice the rate of any other vertical as digital transformation is forcing firms to change how they interconnect users and clouds across multiple locations. New customer wins included a major North American energy company, optimizing network topology to enable digital and IoT and a global industrial manufacturing company adopting multi-cloud to scale its business.","And across our verticals, our channel program continues to drive a consistent and steady stream of bookings and new customers, with 19% of bookings originating from the channel this quarter, up from 15% last year. The channel is now driving over 40% of new logos, and these customers continue to exhibit strong land-and-expand dynamics. We're very pleased with these efforts and view continued development of our channel as a critical weapon in capturing the enterprise market.","So now I'll turn it over to Keith to cover the results.","Keith Taylor","Great. Thanks, PVC. Good afternoon to everyone. We had a great finish to the year delivering on our best-ever bookings quarter with particular strength in our cloud and network verticals. Also as PVC mentioned, we had record bookings in both our EMEA and APAC regions, highlighting the value of our global platform. With 2017 now behind us, I also want to take this opportunity to highlight that we continue to track against our 2016 Analyst Day financial objectives to deliver healthy organic compounded revenue growth with strong flow-through to AFFO and AFFO per share.","Additionally, our M&A activities, including the Verizon asset acquisition, have been accretive to our core financial metric being AFFO per share. At the same time, we've built strength into our balance sheet, raising both debt and equity to maximize the long-term value for our shareholders.","We're putting more capital to work than ever before, building capacity across our markets while enhancing our products and services. This will drive future profitable growth while accentuating the key points of differentiation between our business and that of our peers.","I'll now review the full year 2017 results and offer some high-level commentary on 2018. Then I'll toggle to the fourth quarter highlights. Note that our 2018 guidance does not yet include the results of either Metronode or the Infomart acquisition, both of which are expected to close by mid-2018. Also, do note that we've adopted the new revenue standard, ASC 606, the impact of which is highlighted on Slide 12. And just one final note. All growth rates in this section are normalized and constant currency.","So starting with revenues. We recorded revenues just under $4.4 billion for 2017, an 11% year-over-year growth rate, reflecting strong demand and an expanding market opportunity. In 2018, we'll deliver meaningful step-ups in bookings and revenues, fueling a 10% growth rate, excluding Verizon, and allowing us to surpass the $5 billion mark in annual revenue, an exciting milestone for the company.","Our revenue guidance and corresponding growth rate absorbs a $54 million negative impact from our FX hedging program and the dilutive impact of the slower-growing but highly accretive Verizon assets. It's important to note that the Verizon sites are highly utilized, and as highlighted on our expansion tracking schedule, will receive much-needed incremental capacity, predominantly in the second half of the year. The revenue attached to the incremental capacity will be partially offset by the anticipated Verizon churn in 2018, resulting in low single-digit revenue growth on the Verizon assets in 2018.","In 2017, we improved our adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding integration costs, to 48.2%, a 70 basis point improvement over the prior year as we continued to make progress towards our long-term 50% adjusted EBITDA margin target. In 2018, we're leveraging our business scale to maintain these healthy margins while absorbing the impact of the new acquisitions and investing in key growth initiatives, including strategy, services and innovation, quota-bearing sales reps and customer experience initiatives. For 2018, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margins to remain at 48.2%, excluding integration costs, or 47.6% on an as-reported basis. We expect to incur $35 million of integration cost for 2018 related to the Verizon, Itconic and Istanbul 2 acquisitions.","2017 AFFO was over $1.4 billion, higher than expected for the year. Looking forward, 2018 AFFO is expected to grow 7% over the prior year, including the incremental debt service cost in support of our future growth. AFFO for 2018 includes a step-up in the income taxes to a more normalized level as we incur some discrete tax losses in 2017 related to our foreign debt refinancing activities.","After adjusting for the income tax fluctuations, we expect continued strong flow-through from adjusted EBITDA to AFFO, commensurate with the expectations set at the 2016 Analyst Day. 2017 AFFO per share was $19.23, which we expect to increase in 2018 to greater than $20.82 per share, excluding integration costs. We've assumed a weighted average 80.2 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, including our 2017 ATM equity program. We continue to expect AFFO per share to show strong momentum, particularly as we benefit from the investments made in 2018, which we anticipate will bear fruit in 2019 and after. AFFO per share is and will continue to be a key metric that we use to drive and value our business.","2017 cash dividends totaled $612 million. As we continue to both scale our business while growing our shareholder dividend distributions, we expect total cash dividends to increase to $725 million in 2018, an 18% increase over the prior year.","Now turning to the fourth quarter. Q4 was another strong quarter of operating performance, reflecting the positive momentum we're seeing in the business. EMEA took the lead as our fastest-growing region at 15% year-over-year growth, followed by Asia Pacific and Americas at 13% and 8%, respectively. And we saw healthy net cabinet billing, rising interconnection density as well as increased provision port capacity.","As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $1.2 billion, up 4% over the prior quarter and 11% over the same quarter last year, partially due to the higher-than-planned nonrecurring revenues. Nonrecurring revenues can be lumpy depending on timing of certain customer deployments and therefore difficult to forecast. We're projecting ARR revenues to return to a more normal 5% of revenues going forward. The Verizon assets contributed $135 million of revenues, a modest step-down to the forecasted churn but still above our expectations. Q4 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $5 million negative currency impact when compared to the Q3 average FX rates, a $3 million negative currency impact compared to our FX guidance rates due to the stronger U.S. dollar.","Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $565 million, up 10% over the same quarter last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.1%, excluding integration costs, or 47% on an as-reported basis. Fourth quarter also includes the impact from the Itconic acquisition, our lower-margin business, due to the high level of managed services. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, had a $4 million negative impact when compared to the Q3 average FX rates and a $1 million negative impact when compared to the FX guidance rates.","Global Q4 AFFO was $382 million, up 9% over the same quarter last year and absorbs higher recurring capital expenditures in Q4, consistent with the prior year's activity. Q4 global MRR churn was 2.2%, and we expect 2018 MRR churn to continue to average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter.","Now I'd like to provide a few highlights on the regions, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. The Americas region saw solid revenue and adjusted EBITDA from both the organic business and the Verizon assets. Also, you'll note that we added the Verizon metrics to our operating metrics this quarter, which includes approximately 26,000 cabinets at an 87% utilization rate, 24,000 cross-connects and firm MRR per cabinet.","EMEA delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of record bookings, led by the U.K. and benefiting from its 22-market reach. Asia Pacific delivered record bookings with strong performance in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. And we saw strong exports driving deals to other regions, particularly from China and Korean firms expanding their footprints globally.","The Americas, Asia Pacific and EMEA interconnection revenues were 22%, 14% and 9% of recurring revenues. From a total company perspective, interconnection revenues stepped up to 17% of total recurring revenues.","Now looking at our balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 8. We continue to optimize our capital structure, taking advantage of the low interest rate environment. In Q4, we completed a number of debt refinancing initiatives that effectively reduced our debt service costs, extended our debt maturities and continue to set us on the course to become an investment-grade rated company.","In December, we raised EUR 1 billion at very attractive interest rates to refinance existing term debt while upsizing our revolver capacity. Our average rate of borrow across our key debt instruments now sits at approximately 4.1%. Unrestricted cash and investments was $1.45 billion. Our net debt leverage ratio, net of the unrestricted cash, remained at 3.9x Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA.","Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $433 million, including a recurring CapEx of $63 million, above expectations in part due to timing of payments and high level of project activity. Our 2018 capital plan reflects strong underlying demand conditions across many of our operating markets, increased utilization rates across our assets and a step-up in the scale of the business, including investments in new products and services. Currently, we have 30 new construction projects underway, 2\/3 of which are on owned properties, adding capacity in 20 markets around the world.","Our capital investments are delivering healthy growth and strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Revenues from our 99 stabilized IBXs grew 5% year-over-year, largely driven by increasing cross-connects and power density. These stabilized assets are generating a 29% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested, down slightly compared to prior quarter due to land and building acquisitions relating to our stabilized assets in the quarter. The stabilized assets remain at a utilization rate of 84%.","We're proactively increasing our IBX ownership, too. We recently purchased our Helsinki 6, Milan 3 and Lisbon 1 data centers as well as land in Sofia and Warsaw to continue to invest heavily in other owned -- I'm sorry, pardon me, and we continue to invest heavily in other owned properties in Ashburn, Chicago and Silicon Valley.","Revenue from owned assets is 42% in the fourth quarter, down slightly compared to prior quarter due to the inclusion of primary lease sites from the Itconic deal. Upon closing of both the Infomart and the Metronode acquisitions, we expect revenues from owned sites to increase significantly to 45% or greater.","So with that said, let me turn it back to PVC.","Peter Van Camp","Thanks, Keith. Now I'd like to summarize our strategy, so please refer to Slide 18.","This year, we plan to invest behind our market momentum and build wisely on our global leadership position. We will continue to press our advantage and deliver value for customers that will be very hard for others to replicate. We will invest further in our work to catch the next wave, responding to key market trends that will fuel digital transformation and shape our future as a company. And as we grow, we'll scale the company foundation for the next decade.","Our strategy is well aligned with our evolving industry and fueled by strong secular forces. We are responding to this exceptional opportunity by rolling out new initiatives around hyperscale infrastructure, delivering innovative new services, connecting our IBXs around the globe and pursuing targeted acquisitions that build interconnection density and enhance asset ownership.","Integrating these acquisitions into Equinix has been demanding at times, but we have honed our integration capability and view it as a significant competitive advantage and essential to our larger efforts to build out a consistent global platform. We will continue our strategic and ongoing support of the enterprise and cloud, and we will be spending more time targeting and investing in ecosystems that will create the most value for Equinix and our customers.","We believe interconnection will become even more important for our customers in the years to come, so we're working to ensure that this value proposition is as strong as ever. And as we grow, we must put even more emphasis on how we develop and scale our people, processes and systems to fuel not only our current position but the future state as well.","So in closing, we've achieved a number of significant milestones around interconnection, innovation and acquisitions in 2017, and we see solid fundamentals coming into 2018. As we approach our 20th anniversary and reflect on what we've built, we remain true to our core principles of delivering a global platform for our customers' infrastructure. We have a clear vision of our strategy and opportunities ahead and are looking forward to another successful year.","So let me stop there, and we'll open it for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael","Two questions if I may. First one, it looks like 2018 is shaping up to be a greater investment year than perhaps what The Street was expecting. Can you just talk more about what the opportunity -- or how that's going to position you as we exit 2018? We're seeing obviously some depression in the margins, but is this meant to help sustain growth perhaps greater than 10% as we go into those outer years? Any sense on when we can get back to that 50% EBITDA margin? Just trying to get a better understanding what the payoff is, if you will, of the investments that you're making so that we can kind of look a little bit beyond 2018. And then secondly, just from a modeling perspective, I appreciate that you'll give us more information later on. But can you give us just a little bit of color on what the EBITDA margin is for Infomart and for Metronode just for -- so we could start to think about that?","Keith Taylor","Why don't I start, take the first part of the question, Colby? As it relates to the investment, when we talk about sort of -- there's 2 components to it. There's the capital investment that we're making, which gives you a sense that as we talked about, we have 30 projects underway. Once we close the 2 transactions, we're going to be in 52 markets. So no surprise, we're seeing our utilization levels go up, and therefore, we're making investments. And a number of those investments will be what I would call first phase sites, and that's from a capital perspective. The other thing, I think, that's important to note is that we are going to invest around the HIT program that PVC alluded to. Again, a portion of that CapEx certainly will be dedicated to that.","When you think about the OpEx side of the equation, again, recognizing we're going to grow -- we've said that absent Verizon, the organic business is going to grow greater than 10%. And so that is a greater than. So I want to leave you with that thought. But the second part is we're going to deliver -- when you think about the core business, we're going to deliver a flat margin at 48.2% when you adjust for integration costs. And embedded in that 48.2% is basically the implication of Itconic, which will erode our margins by 30 basis points. And so again, to your question, that's a roughly 35% margin business. But the other part of which I don't think is fully appreciated, we're going to invest in customer-focused, growth-orientated -- oriented investments, and so it's going to be the SSI initiatives, so Strategy, Services and Innovation around Charles and his teams. It's going to be around customer experience and the initiatives that we need to develop there. And it is putting more quota-bearing heads into the business. All of that is roughly 70 basis points. So between the Itconic and this decision to invest in the future, we're basically muting, if you will, the margin profile by roughly 1 full point. And so we're well on our way to getting towards that objective of 50% EBITDA margins. But occasionally, as you know, we have to pause to make investments because we're looking much further down the road to drive even further or greater shareholder value. And so that's where we are with that investment. The last thing I will say just on this is as you look at Q1, Q1 always tends to be a quarter that because of seasonal costs, and you can see that we have roughly $20 million of seasonal cost in Q1, particularly in the SG&A area, SG&A, for all intents and purposes, will remain flat from Q1 through the rest of the year, very similar to what we experienced last year. The other part is when you had Q4 of '17 and you come to Q1 of '18, we're making the assumption that nonrecurring revenues will step down to a more standard level. But as you look forward from Q1 and then into Q2, 3 and 4, we expect revenues to step up each quarter as we exit the year. So puts us, again, on a growth trajectory that we like. The greater than 10% objective is certainly within our sight, particularly around the organic part of the business. And then we expect to exit the year with a high-margin business than we started the year. So we talked a little bit about...","Peter Van Camp","Itconic.","Keith Taylor","Yes. The Itconic deal, again, that margin is, as I said, roughly 35%. When you then get into the discussion around both Metronode in Australia and then the Infomart in Dallas, right now, the margin profile is going to be relatively consistent when it comes to the Infomart deal. We're going to update that as we get -- as we move to the close. As it relates to the Metronode, as PVC alluded to, it's over -- it's in 6 markets. It's slightly -- it will be slightly dilutive at the outset, but we would expect that, that business would get ultimately to the Asia Pacific level of margin.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.","Timothy Horan","Can you give a little bit more color on the pricing environment out there and possibly what you're seeing from the hyperscale guys? Obviously, there was a lot of growth from them, but how do they kind of compare to your base? And what are you kind of hearing from them?","Charles Meyers","Tim, it's Charles. Yes, I mean, I think I would characterize the overall pricing environment as disciplined, and we're seeing firm pricing. And of course, our focus, as you guys know, is more on yield. And so -- but I would say even spot pricing in the -- particularly in the retail space is firm. Supply and demand seem to be imbalanced globally across all of our markets, and we don't really see significant instability relative to spot pricing. So I think we're able to win the targeted deals and then add yield to those deals over time with interconnection and power, and that's really what fuels the business. Specifically as it relates to hyperscale, undoubtedly, that's a more competitive market. It is a somewhat less differentiated market and therefore substantially more price-competitive. And that's why I think we've said that we are going to be selective about our participation in that market. ","But we do believe that working with those key hyperscale partners, continuing to enhance our relationship with them, deepening the linkages between our platforms and making sure that we are being responsive to their needs and having that as part of our portfolio is important. But it is -- it's clearly a more competitive market. But then we're also going to be looking to build dedicated facilities that are, as we said in the script, tuned to those requirements, meaning substantially lower cost to build. And therefore, I think we can deliver reasonable returns on those. And then on a blended basis, given that hyperscale is not going to be a big portion of our total revenue, continue to deliver very attractive blended returns.","Timothy Horan","And Charles, just quick a follow-up on the interconnection between the data centers. How do you kind of manage the channel conflict with the long-haul providers? Net neutrality has been such a key component of your strategy for such a long period. What are they kind of saying to you at this point?","Charles Meyers","Yes, that continues to be the case. I think the depth of interconnection or depth of network density that exists in our facilities and the value that provides to not only our enterprise customers but to the service providers themselves as they seek to serve those enterprise customers is extremely important to us. Candidly, what we've seen is they've been -- there's been a clear understanding of why our customers might look to take advantage of the connectivity between our data centers in order to meet those needs. And the focus of the NSPs is really to provide that broader network connectivity value proposition to the enterprise customers. And in fact, what we're finding is the NSPs themselves are finding opportunities to leverage the fabric and engaging with us on how their SDN strategies, for example, can be furthered by deploying inside of Platform Equinix and leveraging the fabric on their own. So I would say to date, the response has been very, very positive, and that ranges across the really large partners and incumbents through the longer tail of service providers. And so today, it's been a very positive response and we continue to see very much a win-win in the market.","Operator","The next question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin","So on Infomart, I was interested, just as a point of clarification, the land adjacent to it, that comes as part of the transaction? Or was that a separate asset that you already had or bought separately?","Peter Van Camp","Yes, Jonathan, the land did come as a part of the acquisition. So we've already been very thoughtful about just making sure all the compliance is in place so we can build. And so that will certainly help the returns over time in what we see as a really good market.","Jonathan Atkin","So on that topic, the other -- the Infomart, the company had other assets that you could have bought. And given that you're selling hyperscale and given kind of the customer profile in San Jose and Portland and Ashburn, I just wondered why you -- if you would have considered buying the entire company rather than just Dallas.","Peter Van Camp","Well, we did. Obviously, we would have taken a look at the total asset. But frankly, the most strategic part and interesting piece of it all was the Infomart in Dallas, and so we didn't push as hard for the remaining assets. And there was nothing unique or different from a strategic level value in those other assets whereas now that we have Infomart Dallas, really when you think about it, the interconnection and network routes to everything to the southern half of the Americas kind of flow to Equinix. And so the Infomart Dallas became the real interesting objective as we looked at this business.","Jonathan Atkin","So as you develop the HIT product, there'll be more, I guess, expansion put. And I wondered, is there kind of a limit on the number of metros in which you would consider offering wholesale at this point?","Charles Meyers","No, I don't think we have any bright lines in that regard, Jonathan, although I would say that I think what we do is we look at the individual dynamics of a metro in terms of interconnection, in terms of competitive intensity, in terms of enterprise concentration and therefore the opportunity for us to serve and cultivate the cloud ecosystem in that market. And those all play into our level of appetite, I think, to play in hyperscale in each market. And so I think there are a significant number of markets around the world in which we would see that as an attractive opportunity. And I also would say that I don't see it as out of the question for us to potentially use hyperscale as an entry strategy into other markets if the conditions were right and we could derisk an investment by having that -- by having significant anchor tenants in that, courtesy of the hyperscale initiative. So no magic number. I think there is a pretty significant number of our markets around the world. We commented that we have a large number where we're already generating $100 million-plus in revenue. I would say that's a clear list that would be appropriate for us to consider and then again, using it as a market entry strategy, not at all out of the question.","Jonathan Atkin","That latter part is quite interesting. And then finally, on Itconic, I wonder, are there any kind of early learning space on the managed services business that you acquired there and kind of the cloud on-ramp aspect of it?","Keith Taylor","For the first quarter, we did a little bit better in Q4 than we originally anticipated. We're still in the process of integrating the asset. That asset will get integrated through the 2018 time frame. No surprise to you, we have a number of assets around the world, including part of the Itconic business that is managed services-oriented. And we're putting more energy behind that global focus. But it's still a little bit early for us to make any broader comment. It is still -- as you recognized, it was only 17 million between Itconic and the Istanbul 2 acquisition for the quarter. So we still have a lot of work to do. But we're excited about the broadening of the platform and to that part of the Continental Europe. And so stay tuned on this one.","Charles Meyers","Yes, I'd also offer, Jonathan, very interesting company in that they were quite focused on helping their customers in the sort of journey to the hybrid cloud as the architecture of choice. So they were well positioned, had good relationships with the hyperscalers themselves, have some interesting value propositions in services in their portfolio, which we're taking a hard look at. And I think we're already going to integrate our Equinix Professional Services, who is actively serving customers in that regard with what they were doing there in their market. And so that work is underway. And then from a managed services perspective, as you know, we've had a number of assets that have come in over the years that have managed services business. And we sort of sorted through what the right way to handle those services are. But they're somewhat dilutive to the margin profile but often an important part of the local market dynamics. So we'll continue to evaluate those in the same way we've done with prior acquisitions.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.","Michael Rollins","I was wondering, Keith, if you could talk a bit about the nonrecurring revenue in terms of what drove the strength in 4Q and more about your expectations for why that's going to fall in 2018. I think in prior guides that you've given, you also thought at times, it would slow down, and it's been a line item that I think it's fair to say has outperformed some of your prior expectations. So maybe what's going into it next year? And what are the activities that might drive a change in that expectation?","Keith Taylor","Sure. It's a great question, Michael. First and foremost, recognizing nonrecurring revenue in its very nature tends to be lumpy and does not recur. And although we are stepping up year-over-year, we're just not expecting the same level of growth. Having said that, there's nothing to prevent us from having that. There's always one-off or discrete items that happen on the nonrecurring line, and we saw a lot of that take place in the fourth quarter. As you saw, we're well above -- on an FX-neutral basis, well above the top end of our guidance range, and part of that was absolutely due to nonrecurring activity. So we're just taking a much more prudent view on what to assume on a go-forward basis. But again, there's nothing to prevent us from realizing the same outcome. We just don't want to make that assumption from the get go, particularly as you -- as we came off a very, very strong quarter of nonrecurring revenue being 6.5% of our total revenues in the fourth quarter.","So from a guidance perspective, we've said the business will grow at greater than 10%. It is being marginally diluted by the amount of nonrecurring revenue and also the Verizon assets needing to -- at 87% utilization, the need for incremental capacity and the fact that we're still working through the conversion of those customers onto Equinix contracts. We're taking a prudent view that we're going to have a greater than that number for you. And that's why we're just stepping back and making sure that we put ourselves in a position to deliver against our expectations for 2018. And if we can do better, then you're going to see that come through the results, particularly on the nonrecurring line.","Michael Rollins","And is there a way to think about -- as you look at the investments in sales and distribution for 2018, what do you expect to get out of your direct organization in terms of improvement in sales productivity versus the opportunities on the indirect side?","Peter Van Camp","Well, certainly, the investment is about continuing to reach the enterprise. And as we've talked about before on prior calls, Mike, there has been a little longer sales cycle to that. But ultimately, we're going to add 60 heads to 427, I think, strong go-to-market force. So a sizable uptick in that. But we just feel now is the time, particularly behind the investments we're making this year, to continue to drive the direct organic sales activity. Now that said, we saw great growth in the channel, getting to the 19% this year over last year at 15%. So you'll continue to see the channel absorb a bigger piece of it. But ultimately, I think the direct sales force is still the critical channel. And as we go out generating demand and helping all these enterprise customers find their path to the cloud, that investment is going to be an important thing to continue our growth.","Operator","The next question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Yong Choe","This is Richard for Phil. I figure I'll take another shot at it. Given that the expansion plans are for late second half '18 and the level of it, it seems like, to Colby's point, that things could start accelerating at the end of the year and into next year. And then the Verizon assets, you said, were kind of single-digit growth. It seems like you would expect those to go to an Equinix level, 10-plus percent. Are we looking at this the wrong way? Or is it just level of conservatism?","Keith Taylor","Richard, I mean, let me just validate the comment you made. Clearly, when you look at the results and what we're guiding to in Q1 and what I've talked about from an SG&A investment perspective for Q2 and beyond, the natural output of that would be an accelerating revenue line and the moderating spend line partly because of the seasonal costs in Q1. So the conclusion that you would see acceleration coming at the back end of the year does make sense. But it's also coupled with the fact that we're building 30 projects.","We have 30 projects underway, many of them -- we've denoted this on our expansion tracking sheet, 5 of those projects are Verizon asset projects and very important markets. They're 87% utilized. I'd hate for you to walk away thinking that the Verizon assets can get to the same level of growth as the overall Equinix business because number one, they're highly utilized assets; number two, you have to recognize that we're going to be very disciplined about how we fill up that capacity over a period of time. But the overall business -- again, we're selling a global platform here. The overall business, we believe we can accelerate that top line growth, particularly as we absorb the impact of the Verizon churn, as we build out capacity. And if you take a more aggressive view on the investments we're making around strategy, services and innovation, customer experience and quota-bearing heads, all of that bodes well to an accelerating departure from '18 into '19.","Yong Choe","And then a quick question on the Paris 8 dedicated hyperscale build. Can you give us a little more color on that? And is the future phase capacity reserved already for that customer? Or can that be given to other customers?","Charles Meyers","No, we have -- so the Paris 8 facility is the first dedicated hyperscale build, different design obviously in terms of allowing a lower sort of cost point into that facility. It is not -- we have a very deep sort of pipeline of opportunity, both in terms of customers that are already in our existing Paris facilities. But that is -- that capacity is there and available for customers. But we do have a deep pipeline of opportunities to sell into there.","Operator","The next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS.","John Hodulik","A follow-up to Richard's question. Is there a target in terms of cost per megawatt for dedicated hyperscale facilities like Paris 8? And maybe if you could give us a sense, I mean, how many of these type of facilities would you expect to have, I mean, sort of rough numbers, I mean, over the next 5 years? I mean, should we be thinking of sort of one in every major market where you operate? And then I guess more philosophically, is this hyperscale business an attractive business on its own given the pricing you're currently seeing in that end of the market? Or is it sort of -- does it stand on its own? Or is it just expected to drive value and drive further growth on the colo side?","Charles Meyers","A lot there. Let me try to get all of them. Relative to price point or cost point, I think we probably are looking at 7,000 a kilowatt or south of that and continue to sort of chip away at that in terms of making sure that we can deliver all the functionality requirements to continue to be differentiated in that market yet continue to deliver attractive returns on those facilities in their own right. As to the number, we're not going to -- we're not forecasting any specific number there. What we have said is that we've kind of sort of allocated several hundred million of the CapEx guide that you see in the -- in our guidance towards this. Not all of that might be spent in '18, but then again, we also may use some of our existing capacity toward hyperscale-type requirements. So it's a little bit of a tough one to fully tease apart. But we're not -- we haven't specifically guided on that. I think it's going to be -- what we said is we're going to go in. We're going to do these initial builds on balance sheet because we can do them most expeditiously and learn from them.","And then we'll reevaluate the level of support we will want to provide to that business going forward. And I think going forward, it would probably be highly likely that we would be augmenting on-balance sheet with some sort of off-balance sheet activity, whether in the form of project financing, capital recycling, JVs, any number of other possible alternatives there. But again, we'll have to guide you guys to that in terms of timing and extent of that as we go. So I think those were the key items there in terms of what your ask was.","Keith Taylor","And sorry, I just want to add one thing to what Charles said. I think it's important to understand that when you think about the guide that we have for this year, we've made virtually no assumption on HIT revenue for 2018. And so that's another opportunity for us to continue to show upward momentum on the revenue line. But again, there's not much in the way of assumptions in the 2018 plan.","Charles Meyers","John, there was one other one that I want to make sure I hit, and that was your question of is this is an attractive business in its own right. And I want to be clear. The answer is it kind of -- it depends. Is there a capital pool available out there that is willing to apply its capital to sort of mid-teens returns with this risk profile and finds that interesting and acceptable? Yes. And -- but relative to Equinix and to our opportunity here, we have what we think is a significant and expanding depth of market opportunity where we're going to -- we can provide substantial returns that are substantially superior to that. And so doing this is more a means to an end. I made that clear on the last call, that this isn't about a belief that somehow we're tapping out our retail interconnection-oriented ecosystem-driven market and therefore need to go grab for a piece of the hyperscale pie. This is instead about saying we believe strongly in the cloud ecosystem as a fundamental long-term growth driver for the premium retail interconnection-driven opportunity and therefore are going to put these projects in place where we think those are accretive to that strategy.","And so we'll figure out what the right level is to accomplish that strategic objective, but that is very clearly our goal. That doesn't mean other people aren't going to enter the market and fight over the big hyperscale opportunity that we think is out there. And I'm sure we'll run into it along the way, but we believe we've got a differentiated value proposition due to the breadth of our portfolio, the depth of our interconnection assets, our relationship with the hyperscalers, the integration between our cloud exchange and those cloud platforms and the resources, frankly, that are necessary to support that strategy, which others simply can't do.","Operator","The next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.","Ahmed Badri","So a little bit more of a follow-up regarding the dedicated hyperscale. So what is the, I want to say, estimated number of deals specific to hyperscale deals do you think you'll be doing each of these years? Is this going to be a 10 a year? Are you looking to only do 1 or 2 here and there? Is it going to be specifically targeted to Europe or Asia? Maybe can you just give us a little more color on the strategy for specifically dedicated hyperscale?","Charles Meyers","Yes. As I said, we haven't really sized it. I think that we do anticipate that it would be a global business. We think there's sort of meaningful opportunity, particularly in Europe right now, and Europe has been a very robust market. We are taking advantage of the leader position -- leadership position we've commanded post-Telecity to really accelerate our growth in the European market. So we do see probably the greatest opportunity in that market near term. Behind that, I would say Asia, we think, there absolutely is an opportunity to serve hyperscale requirements in that market as that continues to deliver very strong growth opportunity for the hyperscalers and then Americas behind that. But there is still opportunity here where we think we have strong interconnection value propositions, and the metro strategies really support the hyperscale investment. We'll actively look at that both in North America as well as in South America. So again, we aren't giving any specific numbers.","As I said, I think there's probably a dozen or more markets that represent very real and appropriate markets for us to consider investing in. And probably, we would tend to build hyperscale facilities at a size that are going to support a handful of deals into those -- into each of those facilities through a couple of phases. And so that's probably about all the color we'd probably be comfortable with at this point other than to say we've allocated a few hundred million to that on balance sheet to get to a point where we can come back and give you more clarity. I'd expect we're going to be able to do that probably at Analyst Day and start to give you a little better frame on that.","Ahmed Badri","Got it. And then the second question is regarding Europe. Looking through 2018 and the current general market observations that you've been seeing, is the market strengthening or softening? And maybe can you give us more color on pricing supply and demand dynamics? Maybe you could just comment on both aspects of that so we can get a better idea what's going on there.","Peter Van Camp","Well, I'll just say first, Europe had a great finish to the year, actually a great growth year. And we continue to see solid momentum there. Obviously, as we said, a lot of the capital next year will be going into Europe because they have been getting to a higher and higher rate of utilization. The Telecity transaction actually gave us a lot of good headroom to grow. And through that momentum in Europe, we've largely been filling that up, which is why so much capital will be sent there this year.","Operator","And the last question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Just a quick question going back to the investments that have been made this year. You've obviously taken down quite a few acquisitions in the recent past. Just curious, maybe tying in with Steve's departure as well, I mean, should we expect that pace to continue? Or should we be in more of a digestion mode from an acquisition perspective?","Peter Van Camp","No, I think as we talked about the strategy, we're going to continue to press our advantage. But I know we've done a lot of acquisitions, but we've been very selective about their strategic value and what they've meant to us. Clearly, broadening our footprint in EMEA was a meaningful one, and also Metronode in Australia giving us such a strong position in that market. Those made a lot of sense. And we'll continue to see those and look at them going forward. As you just think about '18 and even with Steve's departure, as you mentioned it, the operating plan, the strategy and everything we're pursuing this year has been set and in place. So ultimately, I think it's a business as usual year with the leadership team being very focused in carrying out the plan that's in place. So I wouldn't look for dramatic changes in our thinking or how we're approaching our opportunity.","Vincent Chao","Okay. And then just maybe going back to the Infomart. I mean, it sounds like maybe high 40s EBITDA margin if I interpreted your comment there correctly, Keith. It's a very high multiple going in. Obviously, there's a lot of expansion capacity on top of that. I'm just curious, how are you thinking about the additional cost to build out that 40 megawatts? And how are you thinking about sort of the returns here given the sort of high going-in valuation?","Keith Taylor","I think first and foremost, as we said, 12 months from closing, we'll make it an AFFO-accretive transaction. The real value for us is what Steve and Charles -- pardon me, PVC, there's a Freudian, what PVC and Charles alluded to was the fact that we're going to invest right in our strategy. And the Dallas market is a very strong market both for enterprise and then just globally from a colocation perspective. And so being able to build contiguous to that space is going to be very important to us. And we believe we can drive immense intrinsic value to the business and to the shareholders by building out that capacity. We recognize that it is a high-value deal, but our belief is, number one, that we're going to get the returns and we're going to develop a strategy that will drive value to the bottom line over the not-too-distant future.","Charles Meyers","Yes, Vince, I might just add. I think you have to sort of telescope out a little bit and put a broader lens on the Infomart Dallas transaction in that you combine a set of things, which is now our NOTA asset, combined with the Infomart asset, combined with our leadership position in Brazil, combined with the depth of the enterprise market in Dallas and now add in our appetite to add hyperscale to the mix in terms of some of that potential capacity, and you have to sort of stir all of that together and say what does that mean in terms of creating long-term ecosystem value and continuing to position to be the partner of choice in building out hybrid cloud, multi-cloud to the enterprise market in the U.S. and in the South America. And I think when you add all those things together and you take the current strength of our overall position, I think we feel very good about the transaction, our ability to digest it, integrate it and move it forward and create value.","Vincent Chao","Got it. And since I'm the last questioner here, maybe could you just give an update on the transition post Steve's departure, where you're at with the search, any comment on sort of how morale is and things like that at the organization?","Peter Van Camp","Sure. Well, I'll start and I'll look at Keith and Charles and Katrina, but we actually just had, two weeks ago, our annual global kickoff. So the whole go-to-market engine was together to really get educated as well as motivated for 2018. So this was a great launch to the year, and I think all the heads are turning in the right direction. So it was a very, I think, strong experience for the team as well as the leadership team because we were all there as a part of it. That said, I think the first thing to understand is that, and this would be my -- this is going to be my focus as well, the near term is all about executing on our plan for 2018. As I said earlier, with the strategy, the operating plan in place, again, it's a business as usual opportunity. Some of that is enabled by the fact that certainly I've had a good working relationship with the team for some time. So this is blending well so far. ","We do have now a subcommittee in the board that's been appointed. I'll chair that and so the board's objectives here, well, one obviously being the best choice for selecting a CEO. But also note that the board's interests are aligned with keeping this operating plan going, and they'll be very focused on ensuring we have a smooth transition to continue to support that as the year unfolds. And so maybe it's kind of a unique luxury, but we do have the opportunity to be as diligent as we need to, thoughtful and thorough as we really solve for this over the quarters to come. So I think we're in a very good position to manage the process but not yet ready to make any further comments on timing. And we're all busy at work.","Katrina Rymill","Great. Thank you.

If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Katrina Rymill, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Katrina Rymill","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that some of the statements that we'll be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we identified in today's press release and those identified with our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2013 and our most recent Form 10-Q filed on April 26, 2013.","Equinix has no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition, in light of Regulation Fair Disclosure, it is Equinix's policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an exclusive public disclosure.","In addition, we'll provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix Investor Relations page at www.equinix.com.","We'd also like to remind you that we post important information about Equinix on the Investor Relations page of our website. We encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information.","With us today are Steve Smith, Equinix's CEO and President; Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Meyers, President of the Americas. Following our prepared remarks, we will be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in an hour, we would like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Okay. Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report that Equinix achieved another strong quarter of financial results, and we delivered against our key operating goals in the first half of 2013. This quarter, we saw strong performance across our verticals, with particular strength in cloud and IT services and continued uptake of our global offer, with strategic wins across each of our regions.","Before I provide further detail on these Q2 highlights, I'd like to provide color on our outlook for the remainder of the year as outlined in our press release. As I believe everyone on the call is aware, our prior guidance contemplated a steeper slope in our growth for the second half of 2013. We continue to expect strong operating performance and an acceleration of growth in the second half. However, based on current visibility, we're now moderating our guidance for the full year.","And bridging to our revised outlook, there are 3 primary factors, 2 of which are nonoperating in nature, included in this adjustment which are depicted on Slide 3. First, we continue to operate in a volatile currency environment and are building into our forecast an additional $11 million in negative impact from currency fluctuation. This is in addition to the $21 million in currency headwinds from Q1, which we already absorbed into our full year guidance when we maintained our initial forecast for the year.","Second, our revised guidance includes a $16 million noncash decrease in revenues and adjusted EBITDA related to a change in accounting estimate that extends the amortization period for nonrecurring installation revenues. This is reflective of a focused effort to move strategic customers to longer-term contracts. The majority of these customers are critical to the strength and vibrancy of our ecosystems. For example, in North America, we have generally lengthened our new customer contracts from less than 2 years to 3 years or more, which brings even more stability to our business long term.","Third, we are tempering revenue acceleration for the second half of the year by $31 million at the midpoint of our revised guidance. This adjustment is primarily attributable to 3 things: first, soft performance in Germany, which accounted for approximately half of this change; two, a longer sales cycle in our enterprise segment; and three, a reduction in average deal size, driven by our focus on ecosystem opportunities.","While these factors create a gap to prior expectations, we remain confident in our long-term strategy, which is resulting in strong yield per cabinet, improving margins and deepening interconnection. Rather than chasing deals that we believe would compromise our long-term returns, we are making disciplined decisions to drive profitable growth and continue to win the right deals that deliver superior value to our customers and drive acceleration of our ecosystems.","This strategy is supporting a steady upward trend in quality bookings and is clearly evidenced by our strong second quarter results, which I'd like to cover now. As depicted on Slide 4, revenues were $525.7 million, up 1% quarter-over-quarter and 15% over the same quarter last year. Revenues were above the midpoint of our guidance on a normalized and constant currency basis, increasing over 3% sequentially and 17% over the same quarter last year.","Adjusted EBITDA was $244.2 million for the quarter, above our prior guidance, and on a normalized and constant currency basis, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 16% over the same quarter last year. Our MRR per cabinet remains firm, and we see continued health in new deal pricing, customer mix and operating margins.","Interconnection growth is trending favorably in all 3 regions, with particular strength in the Americas this quarter, where cross-connect adds increased by 48% over the 4-quarter average as our IBX optimization efforts begin to play out and our key ecosystems continue to mature.","In addition to our traditional contribution from network-to-network interconnection, we're also seeing acceleration in ecosystem-driven interconnection, with strong growth in financial services and record performance in cloud and IT services, bringing our total cross connects to over 120,000 globally.","As guided during our last call, the headwinds associated with our optimization program are beginning to ease, allowing churn to step down even as we continue our highly disciplined approach to customer renewals. This proactive effort to ensure we have the right customers with the right applications and the right IBXs is resulting in strong operating results, as evidenced by our healthy MRR per cabinet yield.","Each of our industry verticals performed well this quarter, and I'd like to provide you with a few highlights. Cloud and IT services continues to be our highest growth vertical, delivering record bookings this quarter, including a significant number of new logos. Our 1,150 cloud and IT service provider customers generate 24% of our revenue and use our IBXs as a source for customer acquisition and revenue generation in their own businesses.","Software-as-a-Service, in particular, continues to be an exploding subsegment for Equinix as many of these providers realize they require a global highly interconnected footprint to deliver the application performance their customers expect.","Beyond the Software-as-a-Service segment, our Infrastructure-as-a-Service customer base is also showing growth. Equinix customers are beginning to adopt hybrid cloud architectures by leveraging direct connections to cloud service providers inside our IBXs. We expect the growth of cloud and cloud-based services to be a major driver of growth for Equinix.","In the financial services, the electronic trading ecosystem remains healthy as key trading platforms and participants expand globally with Equinix. This quarter, cross connects in the financial ecosystem grew 30% year-over-year, driven by our Chicago, London and New York campuses. We now have over 120 exchanges and trading venues inside Equinix, up from 75 just last year.","Growth is driven by new exchanges joining the ecosystem such as LMAX and the Moscow Exchange in London. Additional growth is coming from exchanges establishing a local presence in foreign markets, such as the Swiss Stock Exchange in Tokyo and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange and NASDAQ NLX deploying in London.","Also, the over-the-counter derivatives market goes -- as it goes electronic, this entirely new asset class is contributing to our strong growth. In the content and digital media vertical, we saw steady demand as media companies leverage our global platform to efficiently distribute content across the globe.","Our new digital advertising ecosystem referred to as Ad-IX is helping customers reduce latency and increase ad bid rates, a critical performance metric for digital advertising by as much as 50%. New wins include Rocket Fuel, which recently expanded to leverage BrightRoll's video advertising platform exclusively inside Equinix.","In networks, we continue to deliver solid results and gain market share with key accounts such as AT&T, CenturyLink and Telstra. In addition, we are working closely with our top network customers to enable new services such as Verizon extending its private IP service with Equinix, and more generally, we see wireline service providers leveraging Equinix to connect enterprises to a range of cloud services.","The wireless segment continues to perform well as their infrastructure migrates from voice to data center architectures, with expansions from both network operators and key wireless enablers such as Syniverse.","And finally, in enterprise, we continue to make headway with CIOs as they begin to adopt cloud services and understand the strategic implications that their data center strategy has on data movement and storage, network efficiency and application performance. We see early but accelerating interconnection growth between cloud and enterprise verticals, indicating that our success in attracting cloud supply is resulting in driving enterprise demand.","However, broad public cloud adoption outside of the small to medium business is still in the early days. As a result, we find sales cycles are longer than our other verticals, and average deal sizes remain small but are resulting in high-quality new logo growth across every region.","Shifting to expansion activity. We are continuing to build our global data center platform to support our ecosystem strategy. Today, over 62% of our recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple regions, up from 58% last year. Over 78% of our recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple metros, showing that customers are utilizing our global reach. As a result, we are continuing to invest in our global platform.","Asia-Pacific is our fastest-growing region, and we are investing in 3 new expansions to support demand. In Japan, we announced plans to open our first data center in Osaka, an important new market in Japan's second largest economy. Osaka will provide a second access point to the Japanese market, which is critical to our global interconnect customers.","In Australia, we have approved the third phase expansion of our Sydney 3 data center to support continued growth in our Sydney campus, the most network-dense in Australia.","We're also proceeding with phase 2 of our Hong Kong 3 site, targeting content, network and financial customers.","In Europe, we opened our fifth IBX in Z\u00fcrich in June, a standalone data center that is tethered back to our downtown location, with access to over 90 network service providers. We are experiencing strong demand for this site, which is already 16% booked.","And in the Americas, we continue to progress with our 5 previously announced expansions in Ashburn, Dallas, Rio de Janeiro, Silicon Valley and Toronto.","And finally, we are opportunistically expanding ownership of assets as it makes economic and strategic sense. In July, we purchased our New York-2 IBX, part of the Secaucus campus where our financial services ecosystem is the most robust. Purchasing New York-2 gives us control over a key component of our campus and provides space for future expansion. We now own 18 of our 98 IBXs, and owned assets generate approximately 28% of our revenue.","So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to review the financials for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. So before I turn to the Q2 results, I'd like to take this opportunity to review our progress against 5 of our critical objectives that we established for 2013 and beyond.","First, regarding our interconnection strategy, our net cross connects showed nice growth this quarter, and interconnection revenues as a percent of our total recurring revenues increased to record levels in both the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. Europe's making steady progress against this objective, with particular strength in the U.K. These efforts present themselves in our MRR per cabinet yield metric in each of our regions and over the longer term will increase the level of customer renewal and retention, thereby reducing our future MRR churn risk while also increasing our operating margin and return on invested capital.","Second, our operating margins continued to improve, increasing the level of cash we generate from operations after adjusting for the REIT-related cash costs and taxes. We continue to see a path to adjusted EBITDA margins of 50%, and we'll continue to balance our growth and profitability as we scale our business.","Third, we're making nice progress against some of our key strategic initiatives, including the planned REIT conversion, and other tax optimization strategies. These initiatives will decrease our overall global tax rate whilst increasing our discretionary free cash flow and AFFO, both prior to and after the REIT conversion on January 1 -- the planned REIT conversion on January 1, 2015.","Fourth, as we discussed, we've been working hard to extend the term of our customer contract, particularly those key strategic customers that drive our ecosystems. For example, in North America, we lengthened new customer contracts from 1 to 2 years to 3 years or more, which we believe will extend the overall life of both the installation and the customer relationship. This change in contract term and customer life has caused us to revisit the term by which we amortize our deferred installation revenue.","Previously, we amortized this revenue type over a 2- to 3-year period, and this now has been changed to a 4 -- up to a 4-year period, resulting in an estimated $16 million decrease in nonrecurring revenue that otherwise would have been recognized in 2013 and, of course, therefore, will be recognized in the outer years.","Fifth, we continue to see progress in our IBX optimization efforts and saw a significant step-down in churn this quarter to 2.4%. For the second half of the year, we expect MRR churn to remain at approximately 2.5% per quarter, in line with our prior guidance.","So for the first half of the year, we're seeing solid market conditions as we scale our global platform, with particular strength in the cloud vertical, solid performance across our network, financial, digital media and content verticals. While enterprise remains a substantial opportunity for us, the sales cycle is longer as CIOs sort through the benefits of a hybrid cloud architecture.","This quarter's gross bookings were our third best, despite the increased production over last quarter were still slightly shy of our prior expectations. Based on this, together with the impact of the change in accounting estimate and weaker operating currencies, we're tempering our revenue targets for the second half of the year.","We still expect to grow faster than the broader market and expect both Q3 and Q4 growth rate to increase sequentially over the first 2 quarters of 2013 on a constant currency basis. Separately, I wanted to note that it's our intention to release our annual guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call this year to better align with our budgeting and strategy process going forward.","Now turning to our second quarter results. Let me start on Slide 5 from our presentation posted today. Global Q2 revenues increased to $525.7 million. Excluding the change in accounting estimate, revenues were $531.5 million, a 2% increase over the prior quarter and up 16% over the same quarter last year. Our Q2 revenue performance reflects a $4.5 million negative currency headwind when compared to the average rates used in Q1 and a $900,000 negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. When adjusted for the change in accounting estimate and changing FX rates, revenues were above the midpoint of our guidance range at $532.4 million on a normalized quarter-over-quarter increase of 3.4%.","Turning to Slide 6. We wanted to highlight the diversification of our revenues across our regions, our verticals and our product categories. Of note, global interconnection revenues increased to 16% of recurring revenues from 15% last quarter, a key metric that we remain focused on as we continue to develop our ecosystems.","Global cash gross profit for the quarter was $356.6 million, flat versus prior quarter and up 13% over the same quarter last year. Cash flows margins were a healthy 68% of revenues, consistent with our guidance despite absorbing the change in accounting estimate.","Global cash SG&A expenses decreased to $112.4 million for the quarter, slightly below our expectation due to lower project costs related to the strategic initiatives and a smaller-than-expected advertising and promotion spend. Cash SG&A expense was flat at 21% of revenues compared to the same quarter last year.","Global adjusted EBITDA increased to $244.2 million for the quarter or $250 million excluding the change in accounting estimate, a 3% increase over the prior quarter and a 15% increase over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA growth reflects increased revenue performance, lower-than-expected utility costs and lower-than-planned SG&A spending. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46%. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA performance reflects a negative $2.3 million impact when compared to the average rates used in effect in Q1 and an $800,000 negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates.","Global net loss attributable to Equinix was $28.7 million, primarily due to the debt extinguishment charge of approximately $94 million. This was effectively our make-whole payment, plus the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs related to the redemption of our $750 million 8.125% senior notes. Absent this charge, we would have had pro forma net income of $40.5 million, an increase of 13% over the prior quarter. Our pro forma fully diluted earnings per share would have been $0.79, a 12% increase over the prior quarter.","Now moving to our comments on REIT. We continue to move forward with our plans to convert to REIT starting January 1, 2015 and currently do not expect a delay to this time frame. On Slide 7, we summarize the various expected REIT cash costs and taxes similar to our discussion last quarter. In the third quarter, we expect to incur approximately $11 million in cash costs related to the REIT program, primarily related to professional fees, which is reflected in our Q3 guidance.","With respect to income taxes, we've modified downwards our 2013 estimated cash tax liability to now range between $150 million and $180 million. On a year-to-date basis, we've paid $57.3 million in REIT-related cash taxes. We continue to make progress towards optimizing our global tax structure. And as part of this initiative, we've implemented a new organizational structure that centralized the management of our EMEA business activity into the Netherlands effective July 1 of this year. As a result of this, we expect our effective tax rate to be lower in subsequent periods as the new structure begins to take full effect. Assuming a successful conversion to a REIT and no material changes to the tax rules and regulations, we expect our effective long-term worldwide tax rate to ultimately decrease to a range of 10% to 15%, consistent with our expectation that approximately 50% of our revenues will be generated outside of the U.S.","Turning to Slide 8. I'd like to start reviewing our regional results, beginning with the Americas. Overall health of the Americas business remains strong. As reported, revenues were $312.4 million, and excluding the change in accounting estimate, a 2% increase over the prior quarter and up 10% over the same quarter last year.","Cash flows margins remain at 71%. Also, the level of global deal flow from the Americas region continues to be strong, a testament to the success of our global footprint and service offering.","As reported, adjusted EBITDA was $152.6 million, an increase of 4% over the prior quarter and up 8% over the same quarter last year, even after absorbing the higher corporate overhead spend on the strategic projects such as REIT.","Americas adjusted EBITDA margin was 49% for the quarter. Americas net cabinets billing decreased by approximately 100 in the quarter, largely due to the timing of customer installations and cabinet churn. MRR per cabinet rose slightly and remained at very attractive levels. Interconnection revenues, as a percent of the region's recurring revenues, increased to new all-time high, including 1,600 net new cross quarter average.","And now looking at EMEA. Please turn to Slide 9. As reported, EMEA revenues were $125.6 million, and excluding the change in accounting estimate, an increase of 6% sequentially and up 24% over the same quarter last year. As reported, adjusted EBITDA was $49.3 million, consistent with the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 39%, lower than the prior quarter due to the tax reorganization work performed. Normalized and on a constant currency basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 5% over the prior quarter and 7% compared to same quarter last year. Looking at the second half of the year, EMEA adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to increase in the low- to mid-40s as the majority of the work from the tax reorganization is complete.","The EMEA region delivered a mixed second quarter when reviewed on a country-by-country basis. The U.K. business continues to perform very well, with strength in the financial services, content and cloud verticals. However, the favorable U.K. performance was offset by soft German performance due to a combination of factors, including the broader macroeconomic environment and sales force execution. Our German team hired new sales leadership and a number of new account executives. They're working very hard to close the Q2 performance gap as they enter the 2014 operating year. Our Dutch expansion, Swiss teams are making good progress against their operating targets, with newly opened facilities in each of their countries. MRR per cabinet remains firm across the EMEA markets and verticals, while average deal size decreased over the prior quarters, consistent with our selling and go-to-market strategy. EMEA interconnection revenues increased to greater than 7% of recurring revenues, adding 900 net cross connects in the quarter. Net cabinets billing increased by approximately 900.","And now looking at Asia-Pacific. Please refer to Slide 10. Asia-Pacific had solid sales momentum this quarter, driven by wins in cloud, digital media and content and financial verticals. As reported, Asia-Pacific revenues were $87.6 million, a 2% decrease over the prior quarter and a 33% increase over the same quarter last year when excluding the change in accounting estimate. It's important to note, given the large $1.1 million MRR churn at the end of Q1 that we discussed on the prior earnings call, that the sequential decrease in Asia-Pacific revenues was consistent with our expectations. We've already rebooked more than 70% of the space attributed to the Singaporean churn and expect the entire space to be rebooked by the end of Q3 at better average price points. As reported, adjusted EBITDA was $42.3 million, lower than the prior quarter due to MRR churn and the change in accounting estimate and weakening operating currency. On a normalizing constant currency basis, Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA decreased 7% quarter-over-quarter. MRR cabinet remained strong, with a 4% sequential increase on an FX-neutral basis. Cabinets billing increased by approximately 300 compared to the prior quarter. We added 700 net cross connects in the quarter, with continued positive shift from copper to fiber.","And now looking at the balance sheet. Refer to Slide 11. Our current liquidity position remains healthy, and we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash and investments. Looking at the liability side of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with net debt of $2.7 billion, about 2.8x our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA, a decrease compared to prior quarter due to the redemption of our $750 million 2018 senior notes.","Now looking at Slide 12. Our Q2 operating cash flow increased substantially over the prior quarter's $147.2 million, primarily due to shifts in our working capital balances, including lower cash interest payments. Our DSOs increased to 35 days, an increase over the prior quarter, largely due to the timing of quarter end. Our Q2 operating cash flow included REIT-related cash costs and taxes of $57 million. Absent these costs, our operating cash flow would have been $204 million, a significant increase over the prior quarter. As for 2013, we expect our adjusted discretionary free cash flow, excluding any REIT-related cash costs or taxes, to remain between $620 million and $640 million and adjusted free cash flow to be greater than $175 million.","Now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 13. For capital -- for the quarter, capital expenditures were $122.9 million, below our expectation due to the timing of cash payments to our contractors and favorable spend management. Ongoing capital expenditures were $40.2 million, which included less than $10 million in maintenance and efficiency enhancement and single points of failure capital.","Definitely, given the number of questions we get on capital expenditures and a breakdown of our costs to keep them in good working order, we provided you Slide 14. This slide depicts the level of investment we've made in building and improvements versus plant, machinery and equipment and the maintenance protocol, with OpEx and CapEx assigned to these assets. The most important aspect of this slide is the type of meaningful assets under plant, machinery and equipment and the respective lifes. It's fair to say the economic life of our IBXs and these critical assets will likely extend to 30 years or greater, given the level of spend in both our predicted and preventive maintenance programs. Overall, our maintenance capital was approximately 2% of our revenues, consistent with our expectation, but there should be no meaningful reinvestment requirement in our IBXs.","Finally, turning to Slide 15. The operating performance of our 24 North America IBX and expansion projects that have been open for more than 1 year continue to perform well. Currently, these projects are 82% utilized and generate 35% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. Our 8 old U.S. IBXs grew 4% year-over-year as customers continue to purchase additional power and cross connects.","At this point, I'll turn the call back to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Thanks, Keith. Let me now shift gears and cover our outlook for 2013 on Slide 16. For the third quarter of 2013, we expect revenues to be in the range of $538 million to $542 million and include a negative foreign currency headwind of $4 million versus our prior guidance rates. Q3 guidance includes a $6 million decrease to both revenue and adjusted EBITDA due to the change in accounting estimate. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between $126 million and $130 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $236 million and $240 million, which includes $11 million in professional fees related to the REIT conversion and negative foreign currency headwinds of $2 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be $180 million to $200 million, including $50 million of ongoing capital expenditures.","For the full year of 2013, we expect revenue to range between $2.135 billion to $2.145 billion. As a reminder, this guidance includes a $16 million decrease to both revenue and adjusted EBITDA due to the change in accounting estimate. This is a noncash change only and a result of a longer estimated life for customer installations.","Full year guidance is also adjusted for $11 million of negative foreign currency headwinds from our prior guidance range. On an FX-neutral basis and normalized for the accounting change, we expect full year revenue growth of 15.5%.","Full year cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between $465 million and $475 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the year is expected to range between $985 million and $990 million, which includes $26 million in professional fees related to our REIT conversion and adjusted for $5 million of negative currency headwinds from prior guidance.","We are guiding to a slightly higher adjusted EBITDA margin for the year as we continue to manage our discretionary and incremental spending programs. We are tightening our 2013 capital expenditure range to be between $575 million and $625 million, including $165 million of ongoing capital expenditures. We are investing in our business at a very attractive risk return profile, and we do continue to achieve our targeted returns.","So in closing, we delivered a solid first half of 2013 with strong interconnection growth. We see continued momentum, and we'll execute with discipline while balancing top and bottom line growth. We are winning the right deals that enhance our vertical ecosystems and are committed to delivering firm MRR per cabinet yield, strong margins, superior returns on capital and profitable long-term growth.","So let me stop there and turn it back over to you, Heather, for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess I'd like to get an update on what's going on with the sales force. I know that you guys were still ramping in the quarter. Maybe where the headcount is and what's going on with productivity. And then maybe if you can relay that kind of productivity commentary relative to the bookings activity in the quarter.","Charles Meyers","[indiscernible] So yes, we are continuing to ramp force. I think we are planning to add some initial heads in the second half of the year. I think that will probably take us on a worldwide basis somewhere in the 220, 230 range. In the Americas, we have added some as we continue to manage underperformers out, and we're trying to sort of keep a buffer in the system so that we can continue to do that and try to ramp the productivity. As Steve commented in the script, there are a couple of factors that are impacting productivity a bit. I think the median is still pretty strong. It dipped slightly this quarter. Averages were down, and that is attributable, really, to the deal size mix. As we've said before, when you take -- averages can be a bit deceiving because when you have large deals in the pipe, when you close those, they can spike averages. So averages were down a bit. But again, I think there's a general optimism that we're catching our -- we've got a lot of traction, we've got a record quarter in cloud and in content and digital media, solid performance in financial services and network. Network continues to deliver very strong price points, actually, strong pricing across the board. Really, some softness though in enterprise. And we talked about that. Even though we're short of our targets, I think there's some real reasons for optimism in enterprise. We're seeing solid funnel growth. Very simply, we're not converting the funnel at the same rate at our more mature verticals. And we're seeing deals slip as decision cycles are protracted. And they're more -- it's less losing deals as it is deals slipping into a subsequent quarter. And in terms of enterprise, I think it's really a drive to opportunity in many respects, but they're really the -- the enterprise are really the buyers or the buy side of the ecosystem. And they gain value from the platform by leveraging the critical mass that we have in both network and increasingly are seeing in cloud. So we're seeing a pretty irreversible trend towards hybrid cloud architectures, but it's just taking some time for that to shake out. And so our guidance really reflects a pragmatic view of the bookings productivity for that particular segment through the remainder of the year as that plays out. So that's a bit of color. Again, I think there's -- we're making good traction as we are definitely seeing bookings continue to increase from an overall trend line perspective, particularly in sort of small to midsize sweet spot for our business and consistent with our strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Rollins with Citi Investment Research.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about 2 things, the first on, I believe it's Slide 15. It talks about how the older IBXs have slowed down about 4% year-over-year revenue growth rate. And I was wondering if you could talk about how investors should think about the growth of the relatively more mature data centers you have and just your latest thoughts on that. And then secondly, just going back to the sales productivity. Can you give us some more details of what went wrong relative to your expectations, particularly in Germany and the average deal size? Was it competition where you just chose to focus more on smaller deals? Or was it just the size of the funnel and being able then to take that size of the funnel and convert it was the issue?","Stephen M. Smith","Charles, do you want to take the first -- the second question first?","Charles Meyers","Sure. Mike, let me take the back half of the question, and then I'll give it back to Keith to take the first part. I think the direct answer to the question in terms of what happens, one is, is what I just talked about relative to the enterprise opportunity. And it's just maturing more slowly. As I said there, the funnel is strong, and I think that's actually a fairly consistent theme across the verticals. But it's not -- that funnel is not converting at the same rate, and we're seeing deals -- I'm sorry, deal cycles, sales cycles a bit more protracted. Relative to the deal mix, as we referred to, we saw a reduction in average deal size and that we were talking about that as a contributing factor. And as I've talked about a lot in previous calls, we manage the business to a certain deal mix range that we believe is going to provide us with solid growth and deliver blended returns that fit the business model. As we review the results for Q2, we saw it really was a shift towards the smaller deal sizes consistent with our ecosystem strategy. We're still seeing and winning some portion of our large deal flow, particularly for certain applications or magnet-type customers. But there's no doubt that market clearing prices for some larger deals are dropping below what we see as acceptable, particularly when we consider the opportunity cost of selling our premium capacity at lower price points. So it's really a matter of rather than chasing growth for growth's sake, we're really maintaining the deal discipline, stay focused on long-term value creation and we're just taking a pass on deals when they don't meet our hurdles. In terms of how that affects the bookings trajectory and the results, you have to remember that even a large deal portion of our bookings is fairly small, it can take 10 to 15 smaller deals to deliver the bookings of a large deal. So if we -- one drops out because we determine it's not consistent with our model, then it can take 10 or 15 smaller deals to deliver that same set of bookings. And so it takes some time for our marketing and sales execution capability to scale up to that challenge. But again, the other side of the coin on that is that this deal that's disciplined in execution is really driving the solid revenue per cap, strong new deal pricing and help the interconnection, all of which are evident in our Q2 results.","Stephen M. Smith","And on the middle part of that question -- Keith, you could take the last piece of that on Slide 15. Mike, on the German situation, first of all, the overall business in Europe is continuing to perform well, but it's important to keep that in context. But the forecast in the second half in Germany did weaken as we exited the quarter. A little bit tied to the German market were some softness in the German market in our primary verticals there. But as Keith mentioned in his script, we did have some sales execution challenges. We are addressing those now with sales leadership and individual performers. The enterprise slowdown was felt in that market a little bit, too, so there were some slowdown in sales cycle converting that Charles talked about in the North American market. And a little bit of softness in the financial services could have been tied to the hangover from the New York Stock Exchange-Deutsche B\u00f6rse failed merger. I think that stymied the market from connecting into the activity we have in Frankfurt. So those are kind of the factors that affected the German market.","Keith D. Taylor","And Mike, the deal with -- the first question on the oldest assets growing 4% quarter-over-quarter -- sorry, year-over-year, I think it's important to note, number one, a lot of these assets are reaching sort of a critical level of occupancy. And so number one, a lot of that growth does come from pricing to the extent that there's some level of optimization in those older assets. It does come from new products there, some more cross connects. But one thing that I don't want to be lost on the people listening on our call here is some of these assets are highly valuable to us. And we'd rather let those assets like in LA1 -- we'd rather maintain and cordon off some of that space for our unique set of customers. And so instead of selling it to whomever, if it's a network-oriented IBX like they typically are, we're going to reserve that capacity for that future opportunity. And so sometimes that can retard the year-over-year growth. So it's fair to say that we're being disciplined about filling up those assets. Going forward, I think it's reasonable to expect a 3% to 5% year-over-year increase, and that's sort of how I think about those assets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You noted that you have really come out of the optimization project, which was very much concentrated in North America. And we saw a positive revenue churn response in the quarter, in line with what we had expected. But when I dig into the nonfinancial metrics for North America, we saw a slight decline in cabinets, even though revenue churn was lower across the business. And presumably, tenant quality has improved as a result of this, and yet the MRR per cabinet has been sort of flat. It didn't grow even though we've seen some more interconnection. And so I was hoping maybe you could just help us make a bit more sense of this trend and maybe give us an idea as to what appropriate expectations are for your North American business during the balance of the year.","Charles Meyers","Sure, Brett, this is Charles. Yes, I think the key thing to remember is that the -- it takes time generally when we're -- when you -- as we do some of these optimizations and customers are moving to multi-tier architectures, for example, then when you replace that revenue inherently, implementations mature over time and the yield per cabinet come back and sort of mature along a normal path. And so I think what you see is -- I actually am quite satisfied that we see -- and we've always talked about that the cabinets billing is a fairly timing of customer installations, assuming a big cab adds in Q1. It's just a more erratic number. And I think that as we look at this quarter, I'm comfortable with where it's at. I'm very pleased to see that we're keeping the yield per cabinet strong and very much towards the high end of what we've talked about in the past. And again, I think it's just a matter -- and if you look at interconnect, what we're seeing now is, I think, both a waning of the network consolidation activity that was providing pressure there and the effects of the optimization where, typically, we're trying to optimize out less interconnected business, replace that with small to midsize deals that we will later going to ramp up from an interconnection perspective. So as I look at the nonoperating metrics, I have a very high level of confidence that those are trending in the direction that we would expect and are reflective of the long-term strategies. So again, I think that's just us -- really a matter of us doing the right thing, continuing to have the deal disciplined, and I think it will take shape in the metrics over time.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So just to follow up on that. We sort of drive our models here, and I'm trying to think about the growth variables in the North American region. Or should we be increasingly, for example, be putting more weight on, say, adoption of interconnections as the reason why you grow revenues, say, versus cabinet additions? I just want to true to understand what the key growth model is in North America right now.","Charles Meyers","I don't necessarily think so. I think that our ability to add cabinets continues to be strong. Our bookings and our sweet spot are -- in fact, our bookings are growing nicely. I think there is this pressure created from us needing to perhaps replace some large deal volume with a larger number of smaller cabinet deals. And I think that's one of the reasons why as we continue to ramp up on that. But it's growing. We're definitely selling new cabinets in addition to hopefully growing the interconnection. So I definitely wouldn't see a change in that trajectory. Again, it is going to be a little bit lumpy, but I think we're going to continue to do both of those things.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Keith, I guess I want to ask the usual question. I'm trying to figure out the guidance. So if I just ignore the currencies and I ignore the accounting changes, the EBITDA -- the revenue this quarter was $532.4 million and the EBITDA was $250.8 million. So you had $13 million of sequential revenue growth, and you had $8 million of sequential EBITDA growth. If I look at the third quarter guidance, we're looking at $550 million of revenue, which is an $18 million revenue increase, and we're looking at $246 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is a negative $5 million, which implies that there's going to be $23 million of brand-new expenses showing up quarter-over-quarter, which if I look at the history of the company as far back as I go, I can't even find a quarter where you've had anything like that. So I'm trying to understand kind of how that expense profile changes so dramatically. Personally, I find it hard to believe that it's going to be that dramatic, but this is an opportunity to reset guidance and reset expectations, and you don't want to miss. So I wonder if you could kind of just walk us through that. And the second thing I would like to ask is just on the REIT stuff. If there's any inside baseball that your professional fees are buying you that gives you some color as to where the working group stands and what's next in this process and when.","Keith D. Taylor","Sure. Thanks for the questions, David. I think first and foremost, you sort of hit the nail on the head. And so what I will really do is just orient everybody on the call and certainly you, David. So when we started the year, we said we could do roughly $2.2 billion of revenue, we say greater than $2.2 billion. As you're aware, there's $34 million of currency and a $16 million accounting adjustment. That's a $50 million, if you will, noncontrollable movement, if you will, in our revenue line. That takes you to 21 50. We're guiding a midpoint 21 40. And the reason we're explaining the $31 million, as you know, is because based on the first quarter, the $21 million shortfall from FX, we said we could capture that. And Steve and Charles have done a good job of explaining that. So from that perspective, you then move over to EBITDA and you say, \"Look, 15.5% revenue growth. Now let me look at EBITDA. What's going on there?\" Well, we told you we could do 10 10. And so as you're aware, doing 10 10, if you take out the $16 million again from the accounting adjustment and you do -- and the $14 million, if you will, attributed to currency, that's $30 million. We're guiding you to 90 90 at the top end of our guidance range. If you add back those 2 items alone, you get to 10 20 And so the real shift that you're seeing here is we also told you we're going to spend $20 million in REIT costs. That number has now gone up to $26 million. So on an apples-to-apples basis, you're looking at 10 46. That's sort of EBITDA. And so how that manifests itself really in the Q3 numbers and certainly how it translates into Q4, if you think about the guidance that we give from an EBITDA perspective for Q3, we said midpoint, we're going to do about $238 million. There's $2 million of incremental currency head, as we said. So that's $240 million. As you know, revenues are going to go up roughly $14 million on an FX basis, so $14 million up. But we should deliver, if you see that drop-down to the EBITDA line, roughly $254 million. So what's causing the backstep? Well, number one, next quarter, as we said in our prepared remarks, there's going to be $11 million of professional fees going through Q3's numbers. The amount of energy and the amount of consultants and contractors inside our building today to take the company, move it towards the REIT is substantial. And so there's an $8 million incremental investment just next quarter for all these people, hundreds of people who are in our building working on this project. Second thing, salary benefits are going to go up, $6 million. Thirdly, as you know, Q3 is always our higher utility quarter. We're going to spend more on utility, just like pricing of $4 million. And then there's a small adjustment benefit to us of $2 million. So bottom line, you basically -- all of that benefit you're going to get is going to roll basically to professional fees and this, if you will, this pricing environment. But by the time you get to Q4, you're going to get -- you're effectively going to get all of that back. And so when I adjust all the numbers and I say, \"Okay, if you look at -- if you take out the currency, if you take out the accounting change, how is the business going to perform,\" you're almost at 48% EBIT margin, absent those REIT-related cash -- those cash costs at $26 million. And that tells you exactly what Charles said and what Keith alluded. The overall performance of the business, we're seeing obviously strategic performance, global platform, better margin. Overall, the business is performing at a higher level. And so that margin you're going to get effectively in the fourth quarter. And so that sort of reconciles you to the key differences that I think you've alluded to. REIT, next steps, again, certainly, we're spending a lot as it relates to our advisors. There's nothing that we can -- there's nothing I can tell you because I don't know anything, nor does the team know anything, regarding the working group. And so from our perspective, we're going to continue to march down the road to deliver on our REIT conversion by 1\/1\/15. And again, a testament, they're evidenced by, if you will, the level of spend and effort going on in this company towards not only the REIT conversion but all of the other global tax work we're doing, we're wholly comfortable that we'll convert it as planned on 1\/1\/15.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If I could just ask one quick follow-up. I mean, you threw this new Slide 14 into the deck to try to address, I guess, working cap -- or sorry, maintenance capital expenditures. Is that meant to be Equinix's official view of what you would bake into an AFFO calculation? And were you to provide one is kind of a 2% revenue number or are we just talking apples and oranges still?","Keith D. Taylor","Well, David, we certainly think we're moving down that path. Certainly, we're just trying to give you a sense of the things that we think about when it comes to maintenance CapEx and the level of reinvestment we need to make. I still think we have some work to do on the definition of AFFO. Clearly, we are working on it as you can appreciate, we're looking at our peer group. We're certainly looking at AMT, and we're looking at the Navy definition. Only when we get, if you will, the green light from the IRS do I think we'll come out and give you a very detailed and descriptive point of view on what that AFFO calculation is. Suffice it to say, though, when you look at the discretionary free cash flow, we continue to believe that's a really good surrogate right now. And overall, as some have written, there's some level of conservatism in there, given the fact that it includes all of our ongoing CapEx. So our general view is we're moving down the road, but we're not yet there -- we're not there yet to define what the AFFO metric will be. We use this more as just an interpretation. If economic life of the asset is 30 years or greater, the accounting life is different than effectively the economic life. Part of it is due to GAAP accounting. Part of it is due to interpretation. And this just gives you a pretty good idea of what our spend is going to look like.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering, given what you said about average deal size and also the price competition you're seeing per deals in larger end of the spectrum, can you put that in the context of your business suite software? And is that something that you're still expanding in Virginia and possibly into other markets? And then more broadly, I wondered if you could maybe discuss from a strategic point of view any impacts that you would expect from the efforts on the part of some of the existing data center leads to focus more on connectivity-type services.","Charles Meyers","Sure, yes. This is Charles. Let me respond to both of those. I think that -- again, business suites, as we've talked about, is something that we're having good success with and something that we think is a continued important part of our product continuum as we evolve with customers. And so as we've said, some customers, as they move to a multi-tiered architecture, depending on the size and the performance characteristics of those things, do consider a range of options. And many of them, if they're extraordinarily large in size, go to a wholesale alternative as that sort of third tier in their architecture. Many, however, depending on, again, the size and performance characteristics and their desire to have a single source provider of very often, Equinix, they are saying, \"We would like you to be able to provide us with a solution, a more economic solution for a large footprint.\" And so business suites has been that for us. We've seen and continue to see strong funnel. We're converting that funnel successfully. And so the answer is we are absolutely looking to expand that, not only in Ashburn where we have an expansion underway now, but also in other key markets where we believe, selectively, customers will want to have the full range of infrastructure with us. So that's a little bit perspective on the business suites. And in terms of what the -- relative to other providers that may be adjacent to us in the wholesale phase, for example, focusing on connectivity, that, of course, is completely unsurprising to me, given the economics of our business and the relative appeal of the economics of our business, vis-\u00e0-vis a more raw wholesale offering. But I think when you look at it, the real value, and in terms of the amount of time that it takes to build a global reach and scale and scope of network density that we have, is simply not something that happens quickly. And so I think there are ways that they might, vis-\u00e0-vis their own offers relative to other wholesale players, be able to differentiate themselves and improve their win rate in an otherwise highly competitive environment. I think that it may help some of those players with that. But I don't really view it as, in any way, a substitute for the level of performance in network density [indiscernible].","Stephen M. Smith","Jonathan, I'd add on the rest of world, the way to think about the business suite question is that we'll take the learning that Charles and his team have executed in the North American market and apply a hybrid model outside of North America to focus on those types of opportunities. But again, they'll be focused on magnetic ecosystem pull-through-type deployments that have pull-through effects throughout the ecosystem and the interconnection business.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just real quick. On Germany, if I understood the commentary and some of the challenges there, that all relate to the legacy operations, it's not related to ancotel?","Stephen M. Smith","That's correct. The core issues were with the sales execution just in the verticals across the core market. The ancotel business is doing fine. The asset continues to be a differentiating force in Europe. We're attracting networks and content because of the network density there. So it's playing exactly into the ecosystem strategy as we thought it would.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then finally, Steve, I think during your prepared remarks, if I heard it right, you talked about public cloud adoption by SMBs being a bit slower, and I wonder if you can clarify what you meant by that or if I heard that correctly.","Stephen M. Smith","Yes. I think what we mean by that is we're seeing uptick in the hybrid cloud deployment as the public cloud players continue to deploy across Equinix. And the biggest activity that we all read about obviously is behind AWS and the other small to medium business models out there. So there's a lot of activity there. We're seeing some of it. Some of it goes to the cloud at their location. But I think as enterprises mature, the type of workload they want to put in to source and to data centers like colo models, they're getting more and more sophisticated about understanding the hybrid model, how they can take advantage of connecting to the networks and the public cloud nodes in our data centers, and that's taking time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","With the lengthening of the contract periods, what sort of implication does that have sort of for your pricing power? I mean, in the past, if you'd had shorter contract lengths to see if it effectively could be raising pricing a little more quickly, does this imply that things are getting more competitive or you're trying to lock in customers for longer periods? Any change in the pricing power in your model currently?","Charles Meyers","Frank, this is Charles. No, I would say, in fact, those multi-year deals, many of them, we really had a very focused effort on sort of long-term renewals, particularly with our core strategic customers. And many of those continue to include PIs, annual PIs, which is consistent with the model and something that, I think, people have -- they understand the reasons for that, and it's typically baked into those. So no, there is -- our overall pricing remains firm. I think we look at each of those renewals. And sometimes we do, for example, say we're willing to make some concessions to get even longer durability and term in the contract, and we're willing to make those trade-offs as appropriate. But no, I think that -- I definitely don't think there's been a shift in the pricing power there. Our objective is just to make sure that we have a long-term productive relationship with critical strategic customers that are not only fundamental to our business because of their inherent scale but equally or more importantly because they're central to our developing ecosystem.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And are there any meaningful wholesale leases that you have currently on the cost side that are coming in? What's your expectation for rent increases where you do have leased space relative to what it's been the last couple of years?","Stephen M. Smith","Yes, Frank. Certainly, we have a number of leases. Obviously, we have almost 100 data centers around the world in different sort of -- in different incarnations, as you can appreciate. So there's certainly some that will be forthcoming over the next few years. There's no sort of sea wave of renewals that are forthcoming, and our team, our real estate team, does a very good job of getting ahead of the negotiations, working with the landlord. And certainly, some of the ones we have done in the past, yes, there's been some level of increase that's anticipated, that we've anticipated and, certainly, the landlords anticipated. But that's just baked into our operating plan and our operating model. It goes back a little bit to the comment that Charles made. There's an understanding of PI growth from the customer side. But when you look at it from our side, there's an expectation that there'll be some level of PI in our lease arrangement, and that's just a given. So we continue to work very hard in renewing them. Again, recognizing our lease costs are a relatively a small piece of our overall cost bucket and recognizing most of our leases are on a very long-term lease arrangement with multiple renewal period, we feel very good about, if you will, lease position at this stage.","Operator","And our last question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just want to make sure I understand. In terms of the large deal dynamics that you're talking about, are we talking about a scarcity value in those large deals? Are we talking about a competitive dynamic within those types of deals? And then separately, when you talk about the sales cycles on some of the enterprise stuff, is it because of budgeting or because of their decisions on which way they want to take their compute architecture?","Charles Meyers","Sure. So I think relative to the large deals, I would say we actually continue to see -- one of the great things about being the market leader is you have visibility to the deal flow. And we tend to get visibility to virtually all of the deal flow. And so -- and there is still plenty of and perhaps increasingly, an increasing amount of large deal opportunity out there. And there are some of those where there is a particular requirement relative to performance, latency, global reach, et cetera, that we are still well-positioned and will pursue those deals and win rates that we have become accustomed to. However, I think there is also a portion of the deal flow that is in part due to the competitive intensity of the wholesale space and market clearing prices dropping to a level that we simply view as unattractive. And I think that if you go back several years, you would say, \"Okay, there were probably a portion of those because the premium, if you will, was smaller, that we would have one that I think now you're saying we're unwilling to go to the price points there and are therefore not closing this.\" So I think that's the general dynamic. It's slightly -- and that's causing a slight shift towards our sort of sweet spot in the small to midsize deals. But that's generally these large deal dynamics. On the enterprise side, it is not really a budgetary issue. It is really more related to the fact that these customers are taking time to sort through what exactly hybrid architectures mean to them. And they are moving from trying to figure out how to get their infrastructure out of their own basements and figuring out what portion of that goes colo, what portion of that is well-positioned to move into a public cloud setting, perhaps due to the need for reversible workloads, and what does it mean to implement a hybrid cloud. And oftentimes, as they come to grips with that, they realize that the network density that Equinix provides is a very compelling reason to sort of center their hybrid cloud infrastructure around Equinix. But that is a nontrivial sort of assessment on the part of an enterprise CIO. And anybody who's holding an enterprise realizes that those sales cycles can be protracted. And they often start with smaller deal sizes. And that's really the dynamic that we're experiencing.","Katrina Rymill","That concludes our Q2 call.

Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Okay. Thank you, Katrina and good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We had a great start to 2016, delivering both revenue and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance ranges, as demand for interconnected colocation continues to drive strong performance across all three of our regions.","As depicted on slide three, revenues were $844.2 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 16% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $380.7 million for the quarter, up 4% over the prior quarter and up 17% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. This drove AFFO growth of 35% year-over-year on a normalized and constant-currency basis. For the quarter, we delivered strong gross and net bookings with solid production from both our direct and indirect channels, as we scale our go-to-market efforts.","Our key operating metrics demonstrate the strength of our ecosystem-centric business modal, with firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and healthy interconnection growth. Our global platform continues to be a critical source of differentiation, making us the partner-of-choice for customers looking to respond effectively to increasingly distributed infrastructure requirement. Our reach is allowing us to gain market share, while tapping into higher-growth markets, with EMEA and Asia-Pacific now contributing greater than 50% of our revenues and our geographic reach stretching across 21 countries and 40 metros. We are pleased with the Telecity acquisition and are excited to add this great set of quality assets and people to Platform Equinix.","With less than 90 days under our belt, we are already seeing healthy momentum in cross-platform bookings and are making rapid progress on integration, despite the significant size and complexity of this transaction. Overall, the Telecity assets delivered solid financial performance, consistent with our guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA, while absorbing efforts related to the deal close and the planned divestitures. We see the anticipated revenue synergies materializing and are tracking well to our expected cost and CapEx synergies, all of which is a great validation of the deal rationale.","Bit-isle is also progressing well, tracking above our prior guidance with several strategic wins enabled by these new assets. Our integration efforts are on track and our plans to optimize the business remain ahead of schedule. As we integrate these two acquisitions, we expect to achieve a combined $30 million in annual cost savings, with about 50% of these savings realized before the end of this year and the remainder in 2017.","With Telecity and Bit-isle we now serve over 8,000 customers and are proud that over 150 of the Fortune 500 are Equinix customers. We have increased our already market-leading network density from 1,100 networks to over 1,400 networks and have added a number of critical new cloud nodes to Platform Equinix. We are extending our value proposition as the home of the interconnected cloud with industry-leading providers such as AWS, Microsoft and Google contributing directly to the increase in our enterprise business by enabling enterprise CIOs to quickly and cost effectively implement multi-cloud architectures. Our cloud and enterprise verticals, which represent 28% and 13% of our revenues respectively, remain our fastest-growing market segments and contributed the highest number of new customer additions for the sixth quarter in a row.","Interconnection revenue grew a healthy 19% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. With over 176,000 cross connects and significant growth on our Internet and our Cloud Exchange, Equinix is benefiting from strong secular trends that are driving businesses to become increasingly interconnected. We run the largest Internet Exchange globally with 5.5 terabits of peak traffic growing 30% year-over-year, as networks and cloud providers continue to upgrade their capacity.","Given our high utilization rate of 80% and strong returns on development capital, we continue to expand in core markets, heavily weighted towards existing campuses and Tier 1 market \u2013 metros, which exhibit strong pipelines and attractive supply-demand profiles. We now have 16 announced expansion projects underway. In this quarter, we are moving forward with additional expansions in Silicon Valley, New York and Hong Kong, totaling over $200 million of CapEx. In Silicon Valley, demand remains robust and we are building SV10, a new IBX located directly adjacent to our Great Oaks campus, home to a rich ecosystem of network and cloud hubs and the second largest piering market in the U.S. after our Ashburn campus in Northern Virginia. Notably, for SV10 we purchased the 11 acres of land for this project, expanding our asset ownership in this important market.","In New York, we are proceeding with the second phase of New York 5, the flagship asset on our Secaucus campus, which is comprised of four adjacent data centers with over 10,000 cabinets and is a key growth engine for our Americas business. New York 5 saw strong pull-through post the deployment of the Bass (7:25) trading engine and is also seeing solid demand from the broader financial services community as they embrace hybrid cloud. Our first phase of New York 5 project is already 85% full, with strong pricing.","Our capital investments continue to deliver very healthy growth, as well as strong returns across our new expansion and stabilized IBXs, as shown on slide four. The operating performance of our 70 stabilized global IBXs delivered steady revenue growth of 7%, an increase over the prior quarter, while generating a 31% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, reflecting the tremendous economic value of these stabilized campuses. Stabilized assets include projects that have been open for more than one year with all phases built out. As we shift to 2016, a net three IBXs were added to this category and utilization of these assets remains a healthy 86%.","Let me now cover quarterly highlights from our industry verticals, and I'll with the networks. This vertical experienced strong bookings driven by multi-side expansions with Tier 1 service providers and new wins with Tier 2 providers and cable operators, who are shifting their portfolios to address demand for IP and digital services. We are seeing a resurgence of subsea cable projects to support global cloud deployments and growth of international data traffic, which are creating new opportunities for Equinix. There are more than 50 global submarine cable projects under consideration over the coming two years, which places Equinix in a great position to win a portion of this next generation of submarine cable investment.","In the content and digital media vertical, performance was driven by expansions from both traditional lighthouse content providers and our Ad-IX ecosystem. Advertisers continue to optimize user experience, while architecting for increasing traffic volumes, driven by the explosive growth of mobile advertising. Customer wins included ContentBridge, a supply-chain management digital rights service provider and Grapeshot, an innovative provider of analytics in keyword targeting.","The financial services vertical experienced the second highest bookings of all time with strength across insurance, electronic payments, trading and retail banking. We also saw sharp growth in Performance Hub deployments as financial services enterprise continued to re-architect their IT. Customer wins included Dutch bank, ABN AMRO, a three region expansion by Thompson Reuters for electronic trading and EP2, an Australian provider of digital payment solutions leveraging the Equinix Cloud Exchange.","The cloud and IT services vertical experienced strong bookings across all regions this quarter, including strategic wins with leading software-as-a-service providers, furthering our cloud density objectives. Cloud services adoption continues with over 370 enterprises, clouds, IT service providers and networks interconnecting on Cloud Exchange in addition to the healthy growth and direct connect activity to cloud providers.","Customer wins included Pure Storage, a cloud scale data platform providing hybrid cloud data management for Microsoft Azure and BlueJeans an enterprise video cloud provider enabling direct access via Cloud Exchange.","And finally turning to the enterprise, this vertical delivered strong bookings driven by manufacturing, travel and government wins, as enterprises leverage our global platform, both directly and through our growing base of Equinix partners to re-architect their infrastructure. Over 370 customers have deployed our Performance Hub solution, which helps enterprises optimize their network architectures, access the cloud and drive application performance. Customer wins included Nucor, a Fortune 200 steel manufacturer leveraging Equinix to solve for hybrid cloud connectivity and Avant Homes, a residential and commercial property development firm.","We are growing our enterprise customer base at an accelerated pace as CIOs adopt an interconnected oriented architecture, as shown on slide five. IOA is a blueprint to help CIOs re-architect their IT delivery to better interconnect people, locations, clouds and data. Leveraging our global data center footprint and multi-cloud interconnection capabilities, interconnection-oriented architectures represent a fundamental shift away from centralized, legacy enterprise IT models to distributed and dynamic models.","Direct interconnectivity enables enterprises to react in real time, adapt quickly to change and leverage digital ecosystems to create new value and growth. Enterprises are increasingly looking to Equinix as they embark on this journey moving away from in-house data centers in order to leverage multi-cloud architectures, placed closer to users and their customers. We believe this trend will continue to significantly increase our opportunities within this market segment.","So let me stop there and turn it over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Great, thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. So our first quarter represents a great start to 2016. We continued to deliver top-line growth, expand margins and drive sales across our expanded platform. We had strong bookings in each of our regions including solid cross-region execution. This quarter we were able to benefit from record three region deployments across all of our segments, as customers leverage our geographic reach. Including recent acquisitions, greater than 53% of our revenues come from customers deployed globally across all three regions and over 81% of customers deployed across multiple metros.","Our interconnection additions remain very positive, adding another 5,600 net cross connects and almost 180 exchange ports in the quarter. This is the seventh quarter in a row where we've added greater than 5,000 cross connects in a quarter. Interconnection revenues represent 16% of our global recurring revenues.","Moving to acquisitions, we've seen early momentum from both the Telecity and Bit-isle businesses, delivering against our guidance expectations, while progressing well towards our expected synergy targets. The integration efforts are well underway. We've selected the senior leadership team for the EMEA business and we're in the advanced stages of aligning our sales and delivery teams. Cross selling across the combined platform is taking root and after we divest of the eight assets held-for-sale, we believe that we'll be able to accelerate our sales efforts as customers decide the optimum location to deploy their infrastructure.","In addition we've reduced our expected 2016 integration spend to $55 million. These costs will support our significant systems work and places severance and retention costs, and the substantial organizational restructuring costs related to our REIT and other tax initiatives. As it relates to the eight assets held-for-sale, we remain on track to divest these assets by mid-2016.","Now, as it relates to our full-year guidance, the weaning U.S. dollar has provided us significant FX tailwinds and this uptick along with better-than-expected operating performance in the first quarter allows us to increase our revenue guidance with flow-through benefits to both EBITDA and AFFO.","Our updated annual revenue guidance continues to include flat, non-recurring revenues compared to the prior year, as well as refining our annual view related to the Telecity business, as we continue to work through the divestiture process and complete our integration efforts and have further visibility into their data.","So turning to the first quarter, as depicted on slide six, global Q1 revenues were $844.2 million, up 3% over the prior quarter and 16% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis, our 53rd straight quarter of top-line growth. Our as-reported revenues include $119 million from acquisitions, consistent with our expectations. Q1 revenues net of our FX hedges include a $3.3 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter, and a $1.4 million positive currency benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates, due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. For Europe, we've hedged approximately 80% of our Equinix organic business. Global adjusted EBITDA was $380.7 million, up 4% over the prior quarter and 17% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis, above prior guidance due to revenue flow-through, lower SG&A and innovation costs.","Our as-reported EBITDA includes $52 million of contribution from our acquisitions, as well as $13 million in integration costs. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.1% or 46.9% on an organic and constant-currency basis. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of FX hedges, reflects a negative $3.8 million currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter, and a $1.3 million negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates.","Global AFFO was $210 million, including $64 million loss related to the Telecity hedge. Excluding the Telecity foreign currency loss and integration cost, AFFO on a normalized basis and constant currency increased 20% over the prior quarter to $287 million, tracking above the top end of our guidance range, largely due business performance and lower-than-expected taxes and interest expense. As we continue to focus on value creation per share, upon the maturity of the remaining portion of our convertible our June 16 convertible debt instrument, we have elected to receive the proceeds from the related cap call in the form of shares, thereby reducing the net dilution from this debt instrument by approximately 400,000 shares.","Moving to churn, global MRR churn for Q1 was 2.2% or 2.1% on an organic basis, consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to expect our quarterly MRR churn rate to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% quarterly.","And one final note before I discuss the regional performance. Our non-financial metric sheet and supplemental, including our segment IBX reporting, will not include the acquisitions until early next year, as we work to integrate their unit metrics and results into our financial systems.","And now I'd like to provide a few highlights on the regions whose full results recovered on slide seven through nine. Our global platform continues to expand with EMEA and Asia-Pacific growing organic and constant-currency growth over the same quarter last year of 17% and 25% respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 13%. We added over 1,500 cabinets down from the prior quarter due to timing of installs and churn, and we expect a more normalized net cabinets billing increase next quarter. MRR per cabinet was firm at 1,970, up $11 on a constant-currency basis.","The Americas region had another strong quarter delivering solid bookings from the network and financial verticals, and increasing yield per cabinet and the second best interconnection quarter of all time. EMEA delivered a solid quarter of bookings, with particular strength in the Dutch and German markets, while absorbing higher churn in the UK at the end of last quarter. Asia-Pacific continued its steady growth with Tokyo and Hong Kong as the fastest-growing markets driven by cloud and content verticals. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business with the Americas, APAC and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, 13% and 8% respectively of recurring revenues. EMEA's interconnection revenues declined as a percent of the region's recurring revenue, as the region absorbed the Telecity results. It is our intention to increase interconnection revenues as a percent of this region's recurring revenues over the medium and longer term.","And now looking to balance sheet, please refer to slide 10. Unrestricted cash and investments decreased this quarter to $650 million, largely due to the closing of the Telecity acquisition on January 15. Our net debt leverage ratio stepped up to 4.3 times our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA, although we expect to return to our range of 3 times to 4 times adjusted EBITDA over the next 12 months to 18 months.","Now switching to AFFO and dividends on slide 11; for 2016, we're raising our as-reported AFFO to be greater than $1.015 billion a 22% year-over-year increase. On a normalized basis, AFFO would be greater than $1.134 billion or a 28% constant-currency increase over prior year. Adjusting for the $6 million of interest earned on the convertible debt through the first half of the year, our fully diluted AFFO per share would be $16.13 using a weighted average 70.7 million shares outstanding as presented on page 34 of the earnings deck. Also today, we announced our Q2 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q1 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio is now expected to be approximately 49% for 2016.","Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 12. For the quarter, CapEx was $198 million, including recurring CapEx of $32 million, below our guidance due to timing of cash payments to our contractors. With respect to our new builds, during the quarter we opened Tokyo 5 IBX our 10th IBX in the Tokyo metro taking into consideration Bit-isle's five assets in Tokyo. Tokyo 5 is located near the financial district approximate to our existing network-dense Tokyo 3 IBX. We've tethered these two assets together thereby allowing our Tokyo 5 customers to access the rich set of networks in Tokyo 3.","And given our current high utilization rate of 80%, the strong development returns, we continue to invest across many key markets with new IBX builds scheduled to open in the next year, including Amsterdam, S\u00e3o Paulo, Silicon Valley and Sydney, in addition to the expansion phases in Ashburn, Atlanta, Dublin, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and Warsaw. Also we will continue to purchase and develop land including our recently-purchased Silicon Valley land parcels. Over time we expect revenues from our own sites to increase. Owned properties generate 38% of the organic recurring revenues or 34% of our revenues on a combined basis, as the acquisitions have a higher percent of leased sites. Including acquisitions, over 85% of our recurring revenue is generated by either owned properties or properties where our lease expiration extends to 2029 or beyond.","And finally, we'll provide you a number of slides that bridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Please refer to these slides on slides 13 through 16.","I'll turn the call back to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Okay. Thanks, Keith. And finally on slide 17, which summarizes our Q2 and our full-year 2016 guidance, which includes our FX impacts, let me now cover our updated 2016 outlook. For the full year of 2016, we are raising our revenue guidance to be greater than $3.595 billion, 32% growth on an as-reported basis on organic and constant-currency growth rate of greater than 13.4% compared to the prior year. This $45 million revenue increase includes a $42 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates, and a $3 million increase due to stronger Q1 operating performance.","For 2016, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to be greater than $1.65 billion, a 30% increase on an as-reported basis or a greater than 16% year-over-year growth rate on an organic and constant-currency basis. This $30 million adjusted EBITDA increase includes an $18 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates, a $9 million increase due to Q1 operating performance, and $3 million in lower-than-expected integration costs. And the growth of our business is driving increased adjusted funds from operations and ultimately cash flow and dividends. We are raising AFFO to be greater than $1.134 billion normalized for the Telecity transaction-related FX loss and integration costs, a 28% constant-currency growth compared to the prior year. This $56 million AFFO increase includes a $14 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates, a $29 million reduction in interest and tax costs and better-than-expected operating performance and lower integration costs. And finally, we expect 2016 capital expenditures to continue to range between $900 million and $1 billion for the year.","So in closing, Platform Equinix is the critical intersection point between clouds, networks and the enterprise and this opportunity is translating into solid revenue growth, firm yield and healthy returns on our stabilized and expansion IBXs. Our platform continues to scale organically and we are progressing well with our strategic acquisitions, positioning us to extend our market leadership, enhance our cloud and network density, and grow our customer ecosystems.","So let me stop here and we'll open it up to questions. Over to you Kerry.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question is from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","Great, thanks for taking the questions. So, Steve, I'd love to hear a little bit more about the cloud-driven enterprise demand. I know that you guys gave some good examples during the prepared remarks and you've talked about it in the past, but I'd be interested in hearing about whether you're seeing things different globally? What's going on in the U.S., what's happening in Europe, in the Asia-Pac region? Is everybody sort of heading down the same path at a different time or there are different sort of adoption cycles? Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Let me start and then the rest of the team can chime in here. So I'm assuming Jonathan you're referring to the cloud demand from enterprises to access the public, private cloud providers?","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","Absolutely.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","And so, I would characterize it this way, so we have worked very hard as you know, and the people on this phone know, to populate our facilities around the world with access points, network nodes, cash nodes whatever you want to call them to make it very easy for enterprises of all shapes and sizes to find these cloud providers and buy those services as a service. And so that is happening as the thesis has \u2013 continues to prove itself and as the numbers continue to show you enterprises is growing at the highest rate. Now, the marketing teams and sales teams around the world are pursuing different industry verticals in different countries, so we are building use cases and success stories across multiple industry verticals. There's probably a dozen where we have different use cases being built and they vary by region and by country. The demand is pretty standard around the world. It probably parallels the growth rates that we see, we're growing the fastest in Asia, followed by Europe, followed by the Americas. So I would say enterprise \u2013 particularly global enterprises are demanding footprint across all the big markets across all three regions. So, it's pretty steady demand, pretty steady demand and it's underpinning most of our new logo accumulation. Charles, would you add anything?","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Not a lot. The one addition I might make is just again recognizing that 51% of our revenue is from customers who are deployed with us across all three regions. So I think that I would say solid demand across all three regions and because so many of our customers are global in nature and actually deploying architecture and infrastructure across all three regions, I think that mutes any \u2013 to some degrees mutes any variations, but there are some variations country-to-country in terms of cloud adoption. I would say that, for example, Australia tends to be an outlier on the high side of being receptive to cloud and hybrid cloud as an architecture-of-choice, but we're seeing good solid demand across all three regions.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","The only thing I think I'd add Jonathan to that is, if you look at the CapEx that we're moving around the world, it's as we noted in our comments today, it's across the big market. So the demand is still very, very high in London, Amsterdam, D.C., New York, Silicon Valley these big Tier 1 markets, and so that's where a lot of the enterprise demand is also coming in again where the majority of the cloud access points are.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","Great. And I guess as a follow-up, you talked about the three regions and in your prepared remarks, Steve, you gave us a lot of bookings color by industry vertical, historically you've given us that by region. Is it possible to sort of give us that color on a regional basis?","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Sure. Let me \u2013 we cut it many ways Jonathan, but I'll give you just the Q1 bookings by vertical to start in the quarter on a worldwide basis, roughly 25% of the bookings came in the cloud and IT services vertical this quarter, followed by around 21% came from the networks, around 20% came from the financial services, and then about 17% for both enterprise and content and digital media. That's how the bookings.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","I think he's looking for region.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","So by vertical, yeah, and then on a regional perspective, let's see, do I have that? I think we might have to get that for you, Jonathan. I'm not sure I have that broken out.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","What I would say, though, is it's solid across all three regions. We didn't have a \u2013 this was actually pretty, one of those quarters where pretty uniform performance, solid generally across the regions, so I don't think we're seeing any \u2013 a substantial, disparate performance levels across the regions.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Keith's given you pretty good color on the key verticals by region in his prepared remarks, where the majority of the bookings came from.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. I was wondering if we could touch base a little bit more on sort of the enterprise demand. What we've seen from our end is that a number of these CIO surveys have obviously cited the cloud as a key area of investment, but also we've seen sort of a tempering expectation for investment dollars out of the enterprise. It sounds like you guys are not seeing any sort of tempered spending when it comes to the trajectory of the enterprise based on the plans that you've seen out of those folks and I just wanted to clarify that.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Yeah, Amir, we're \u2013 we obviously read the same reports and triangulate all that industry data with actual data inside of our bookings. And let me give you a couple of data points just from our perspective. So, yes, we do see some depressed IT spending trends and we've read the same reports that you're referring to, but the cloud spending continues to fuel the data center requirements, which is what we're benefiting from and the robust leasing activity that we're seeing is really driven by the cloud, which is attracting the enterprises that are \u2013 almost all enterprises we talk to today are moving some portion of their applications workload to get access to the hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, et cetera. And so I think most of the industry analysts data points suggested high teens today is enterprises that are taking advantage of cloud offerings and that will move over the coming four years to 50%, 60% of the workloads.","Certainly in the conversations that we're having that's a very common conversation. I would tell you that we hear security requirements, we hear cloud requirements, we hear big data requirements and we are hearing the early signs of IOT plans with enterprises trying to figure out how to instrument, monitor and measure all this data that they are creating to try to monetize it. So, there is certainly plenty of trends from the enterprises across these big segments that we're all reading about in these reports.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, and I guess I'd just offer and add that, what we're seeing is that hybrid cloud adoption is accelerating and in fact I think we look at interconnection-oriented architectures as essentially a mechanism by which these enterprise CIOs are allowing them to do more with less, and that's a key priority for them. And if you look at adoption rates, IDC says that 65% of enterprises are going to be committed to hybrid multi-cloud by the end of this year, and so we're seeing a very rapid clip of adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud and a real resonance to the interconnection-oriented architecture, and while they may be \u2013 their overall spend levels may be reducing because they're not spending as much on traditional IT spend categories, I think that the hybrid cloud enablement in that area is actually increasing in total spend at least from what we're seeing with the enterprise customers that we're serving.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's very helpful and then I was wondering if we could touch more on the global footprint. I mean clearly you folks have a lot of customers that are using \u2013 that are working with you on multiple geographies. As you've continued to expand that footprint and as you are starting to see enterprises sort of accelerating the adoption of the cloud, do you feel like you're in a position to get more of that share in that transition as the global footprint is built out?","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Short answer is yes. I think most of the customers that we serve have, particularly as they deliver cloud services, even if they're delivering revenue-generating cloud services or they're delivering cloud services that are intended to deliver certain applications to their employee base or whatever, they're doing so on a global basis increasingly. And as they do that they're looking for an infrastructure partner that can get them to where they need to be and get private, secure, high-performance interconnection to the public cloud services that they're looking for across all three regions. And so, Equinix is really a very positive choice for that, so we're seeing a lot of adoption across the geographies.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","And probably another data point, excuse me Keith, (35:37) but another data point here to supplement Charles' point, our cross-border bookings continue to increase quarter-on-quarter. So that's a signal that we see big demand from customers on \u2013 like a single supplier to deal with across multiple regions. So once you see cross-border bookings growing, that's a really good indicator that the demand is global and they like dealing with a single set of orders, quoting, pricing, billing and that's the advantage we have.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","And let me just conclude it, Amir, with the fact that one of the comments is the opportunity set that we see in front of us, there's a direct correlation to the amount of CapEx that we're putting forth into the market and as yourself and the other listeners on the call today know, we've committed to still spend somewhere between $900 million and $1 billion and that capital is being deployed somewhat consistent with the revenue stream, but roughly 40% of it will go to EMEA, almost 40% will go to the Americas, and around 20% will go to APAC. It's not a perfect alignment with \u2013 based on the revenue streams, but it tells you that we are spending quite nicely across all three regions to represent what we think is going to be the underlying demand for these assets.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Yeah and one of the big reasons APAC under indexes there, Keith, is because of the capacity we got with the Bit-isle transaction.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Correct.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much for the incremental color.","Operator","Thank you. Out next question is from Michael Rollins of Citibank. Your line is now open.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. First question is on the non-recurring. Can you talk about the outperformance in the non-recurring line, maybe some of the business drivers behind that, and how that is affecting your outlook for revenue for the rest of the year?","And the second question is, if you look at your global utilization levels, they're running a little bit elevated relative to the longer historical period. So what does that mean in terms of the availability of growth to the business over the next few quarters? What does that mean for future capital? Should we expect capital to accelerate to give you more capacity, which will naturally push that utilization down or are you maturing as a business and you're just going to run at higher utilization levels than some of your history? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Let me start and then I know Charles and Steve will jump in here. First as it relates to non-recurring, we did see a little bit of an uptick this quarter. One of the things that we started the year with, Mike, as you know is we took a very strong view because of the amount of non-recurring business we did in fiscal year 2015 and the number of meaningful deployments we did across our platform, we made a conscious decision because they do come in ebbs and flows to hold that flat for fiscal-year 2016. Now you saw a little bit of a step up in the Q1 results, that's just a reflection of the lumpiness, if you will, of the non-recurring activity. As I then sort of \u2013 take you then to Q2, we are assuming that the non-recurring activity will go down quarter-over-quarter, partly because of what we see in our pipeline, and partly it's what's \u2013 not what's just in the pipeline, what's in our backlog. So we expect that we'll reduce our non-recurring revenues by roughly $5.5 million next quarter or roughly 60 basis points of growth. So that gives you a sense that again, we still look to do a lot of it, again I hold at the same level as 2015 but we'll see it move around quarter-over-quarter.","As it relates to utilization levels, yes, no surprise we are running at higher levels. We've had a tremendous amount of success over a number of quarters and when you see that success and also the incremental cabinets billing, that's a clear indication that we're filling up our assets and it suggests that we're going to have to continue to put capital to work. There are certainly some markets that are more constrained than others. Charles was great in alluding to the Tokyo market, whereby through the acquisition of Bit-isle we got a very large asset, which will allow us to delay any meaningful future spend in Japan for some time period. Yes, there are other markets where we talked about on the last earnings call where we're now going to do what we call first phase builds, which come with a much larger capital deployment in that initial phase.","Silicon Valley is a perfect example, the one that Steve alluded to and there is S\u00e3o Paulo, as well and Sydney 4 and the like. So we are continuing to make sure we manage ourselves. I want to leave you with a couple of thoughts on how we manage our CapEx. We go through a very detailed exercise. We're looking five years out. We're looking across markets and IBXs to make sure we understand what our fill rates are, what is the empirical data telling us and what does that imply against our future expectations, understanding what competitive landscapes like in each of those markets or specific to that IBX.","And so when we do that, we look out five years, we have a pretty good view on what we think we could spend. So then in conclusion to go back \u2013 to address your final question, we're very much aware of what our capital spend is. As you know that can ebb and flow based on our performance, knowing that your lead times are going to be anywhere from 9 months to 18 months depending on whether it's an incremental phase or a new build, that's going to dictate what the capital dollars are, but there is an expectation that we will continue to spend at these levels for a period of time given the demand that we see in the marketplace. I will say one last thing, which I think is important, one of the things that we want to do is continue to see our utilization go up, but we recognize that you are at a point where you don't want to constrain the business.","There are certainly some markets where we feel a little bit more constrained today than we otherwise like to feel. And so we need to put the capital to work in those markets. Silicon Valley comes to mind again as a critical market where we're very eager to get up that \u2013 to put up that Silicon Valley 10 asset, because left unchecked, it will put a constraint on our ability to grow, but we feel we're in a great position to deliver the inventory on a fairly (42:10) just-in-time basis.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Yeah, two more minor adds; actually one pivots off that last point. One is your question, Mike, around growth and what the utilization implies. If you look at our stabilized assets chart, it delivers 7% I think was what this quarter was and what you'll see there is actually we've seen that \u2013 we see that bounce around a little bit this pretty good quarter and on a constant-currency basis have seen even better quarters. And so, you see that the stabilized assets still have meaningful growth potential in them even at quite high utilization rates. And then the second point I'd make is that we are making a very purposeful push to phase our capital as best as possible, and so we're trying to be as innovative as possible in phasing our capital and that is going to have a natural tendency to sort of pressure utilization up a bit, which is a good thing as long as we still have the flexibility to respond and not go dark in the market. And so that's the balance we're striking. And I do think kudos to our engineering and construction teams for really phasing our capital in ways that are allowing us to still be responsive with higher levels of utilization.","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Mike, I think the thing I'd add. If you look at slide 23 in the presentation today on our announced expansions, just to pick out a handful here between what we're doing in London next phase, Amsterdam next phase, D.C. next phase, New York next phase, Silicon Valley next phase, you're a little over $300 million of CapEx that's going into some pretty significant markets to Keith's point. That's going to be done just in time and provide available capacity for the growth rates that you see us delivering here.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. Just first, maybe, Steve, on the Telecity acquisition, could you kind of give us a status update on where we are both in kind of the revenue integration opportunity and the cost integration opportunity. And how you feel that is if at all baked into the rest of the year outlook? And then second, I guess, I don't know who this will for. If Charles is online maybe for you, but if there is one kind of fear that people may have it's that, as the public cloud gets more reliable, more secure that it has the potential to accommodate a growing share of all the outsourced applications that are existing and that slowly the public private, hybrid cloud becomes little less private and a little bit more public and it creates a cannibalization risk. Could you kind of talk about how you view that issue and if there is any evidence that it's happening in any way inside the Equinix facilities today? Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Yeah, those are two great questions. Thanks, David. Let me start in the public cloud question and then Charles can jump in here on that and maybe give you an update on Telecity. Very good question. I know, the big concern would be is everything going to move to public and is there going to be a need for the type of stuff that hosting and managed services and colo providers are providing? The world that we see unfolding and certainly all the industry analysts and all the customers we talk to certainly support the thesis that the hybrid cloud customers needing access to public Internet capability, which has always been there to Equinix for years and years and years, is not going to go away. We have been working very hard the last four or five years working with all the cloud providers to provide this private connectivity to give the combination of the two, which in our language gives you the hybrid capability to be able to move your traffic around the world is continuing to build and unfold and most of the documentation writings today suggest that public cloud is going to continue to grow from high teens to, like I said earlier, 40%,50% 60% of workload's going to the public cloud and the thing that I think people get confused about, even the big public cloud providers who build their big data centers and build their back office facilities all over the world, still require the Equinixes of the world and the other data center providers of the world for the distributed part of their network because they are not terribly interested in putting capital in 40 different markets and 20 different countries and so they're going to take advantage of the capacity that's out there with the Equinixes of the world to build the hub and spoke, if you will, or build the centralized and decentralized network to run these cloud offerings and because users are all over the world, customers are all over the world, latency is a big factor and that's why you see the continued rollout of public private connectivity and capability. I don't know what you'd add to that Charles","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","The only little incremental color on that I would say is that, I absolutely think that we're seeing and, I think, the results of the strong players in the cloud market both on the sort of ISI as well as SaaS are clearly demonstrating they're going to continue to add capability and functionality that is going to allow them to attract a significant portion of workloads out of the traditional IT sort of consumption model into the cloud model. So, we absolutely see that, we embrace it, and in fact our platform is really facilitating it.","And so, I think if I were a commodity provider of colocation, we'd be very worried about that substitution. But that's not really the business we're in. We're in the business of enabling that hybrid cloud connectivity, one, via the CSPs and so the supply side of the cloud ecosystem is very relevant for us. And in fact, our top six customers are all delivering cloud services, using Platform Equinix as some portion of their architecture to do so. And so, it's a big opportunity for us. And then we see a big basket, a very big basket of enterprise workloads that we believe will sort of reside into private infrastructure side of things and really be implemented in this sort of hybrid cloud, multi-cloud setup. And so, for us we think it's a very much a net positive, but I do believe that this trend you're talking about for cloud service provider is becoming increasingly capable is real and will affect I think the broader data center market.","And then, let me circle back to Telecity now, and I'll give you sort of a quick update and anybody can add color as they wish. We're less than 90 days into the post combination world, and I'd tell you, as a headline we remain very optimistic and thoroughly convinced to the rationale for that transaction. Deal really cements our leadership in EMEA, 34 new locations and seven new metros, six new countries, material improvement in our network density, which was already marketing leading in EMEA and we add a number of really critical cloud nodes to our platform, of note would be the new Telecity locations in Dublin, which are a great addition for us and is seeing significant demand. And overall, we're really delighted with the quality assets and people that we've added to the team.","As we said in our prepared remarks, a lot of progress on the integration. We've announced the senior leadership team well advanced in aligning and cross-training the sales and delivery teams, well advanced in our rebranding plan, taken all the steps we needed to be fully REIT compliant, and as I said, we are already seeing cross platform opportunities both in the form of Telecity customers with an interest in Equinix facilities, a bit more so right now of our Equinix customers really seeing opportunities to purchase capacity in the Telecity sites. And I think we are seeing more in that direction only because we have a larger force selling that on the Equinix side and we're working through the sort of natural distractions of a team going through an integration on the Telecity side. So, but we feel good about the synergies. We actually think we're going to exceed the synergy estimates that we had previously provided. All that's baked into the guidance you see here today. And again, we do think there is over time meaningful revenue synergies as well as the cost synergies, which I said, I think we'll exceed and the CapEx synergies that are allowing us to defer some investment in EMEA.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","The only thing I'd probably add, Charles, is the divestiture process, David, is we are running and have been running a very robust process. It's proceeding as we expected. There have been very high levels of interest throughout the entire process and we still are on target to complete the transaction by mid-year.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, following up there. You had mentioned earlier some higher churn in the UK, is that part of what you just mentioned. And then second, it seems like Bit-isle is tracking to the high end, what's happening there?","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","So let me take that, as it relates to the churn that we experienced in Q4, that was what we had telegraphed in the marketplace. If you look at the organic churn in Q1, we're roughly 2.1%, consistent with where we think there's a natural churn level in and around that level in the organic business. Where you're seeing slightly increased churn is attributed to the Bit-isle business. What we talked about on the last earnings call was effectively Bit-isle, part of the reason that we felt comfortable holding the revenues flat relative to \u2013 for 2016 over 2015 was the fact that we did have this increased level of churn. Now having said all of that, coming out of our prior guidance, the Bit-isle team did a little bit better than we originally anticipated. It's more so in their other services and less in their colocation business, so suffice it to say between what they're doing in the colocation business and what they're performing in the managed services business, there is a direct correlation between what they do in managed services and the pull through to colo. So, we're very excited about their performance to-date and we continue to focus on very much optimizing that acquisition and I think over the next few quarters, will be much more discuss as it relates to Bit-isle asset.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very diplomatic. If I can follow up, there was some slowing in EMEA cross connect growth this quarter, is that seasonality or what should we be thinking about there?","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","The primary reason for the slowing of \u2013 if you're dealing with on a holistic basis, the primary reason really is more to do with the fact that we have taken the Telecity business and we've merged it into the organic Equinix business, and as a result, their ability while they are generating, if you will, spilling out the interconnection relative to what we are getting, it diluted the overall performance. So, it's not to suggest that it's slowing down, we think of this as a great opportunity, but the way Telecity sort of prosecuted that opportunity was it was more embedded in colocation. We're going to over time as I talked about, like breaking out their unit metrics and doing the inventories of all of their cabinets and cross connects and the like, and getting their financials more aligned with Equinix, we'll be in a much better spot in the coming quarters to give you much more clarity on that. It's a little early. As Charles alluded to, we're just 90 days into it. As many of you know, under the UK takeover code, we really couldn't touch the results until after January 15, and with an acquisition of that magnitude and knowing what we had to accomplish, we still have work to do and so we're eager to get into it, dissect it more, which will allow us to give you more visibility in the coming quarters.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. So on Telecity, I wonder if you could provide a little bit more color on driving \u2013 interconnection Europe's in EMEA more generally and maybe Telecity specifically, any adjustments that you sort of need to make to the products, investments you are going to be making to the platform on a broader basis? And then I wondered about the cost synergies. I think you talked about $30 million across both Bit-isle and Telecity. And what's the rough breakdown of that by region? Is it operating costs, energy costs, what is sort of the composition of that? Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Let me start with the sort of a few things on the alignment of the product portfolios, et cetera, and then I'll let probably Keith tackle the synergies, any commentary on that. But we are in the process of aligning the product portfolios. Generally, I would say that the company's had a fairly consistent strategy in the marketplace, so probably not a dramatic set of changes in the product portfolio is there, but we are in a process of taking those and aligning the product portfolios. I will say that, as Keith commented on we have \u2013 interconnection is a very central part of how we go to market and how we position with customers. And so it's really \u2013 it's critical that we \u2013 we have a great track record of getting the value, delivering great value to our customers through cross connects and through interconnection. And we also have a great track record of making sure that we get value back in the form of how that's priced. And so needless to say, we'll maintain that strategy and we'll implement it within the Telecity environment as over time because I think our customers are really getting superior value from that. So \u2013 but we're in the process of figuring out what that implies in terms of aligning the product portfolios. We're well advanced in that effort and I think we'll start to see the results of that over the coming quarters.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","And so, Jon, as it relates to basically the synergy costs or benefits, clearly I think it's important to recognize the two acquisitions, we're looking at them quite differently. As it relates to Telecity, Charles alluded to a number of the points. We're certainly going to look to what are the opportunities on the top line on driving incremental revenue that's attached to alignment of our product portfolio and the like. And we're very confident, albeit we've said there is only modest revenue attachment to that this year, but we're very confident that that will continue to be something that will drive value going forward. As it relates to the cost side which \u2013 that's the $30 million we referred to, we talked about $15 million this year, $15 million in 2017. Again, we're optimistic that we're not only going to be able to get that number, but we'll get beyond that number. Again, I'm reticent to give you the exact numbers just yet because given the lack of visibility that we had into the numbers prior to January 2015, we're still doing a lot of work as we said to align the sales and delivery organizations as well as all of the back office. But again, I want you to walk away being confident that we see some incremental benefit.","As it relates to the below-the-line activity more specifically around taxes, again, we think of our tax structure as a competitive advantage and no surprise to you as we then deploy that structure across our portfolio that will generate benefits to our shareholders and so we're excited about that as well.","Now, the other thing I would say is, recognizing that Telecity, we're in the business of investing in this business and so what we want to make sure is that we continue to invest alongside it. So we're managing the synergies with continuing to drive value into the assets and expand that portfolio consistent with what Equinix's expectations would be.","As it relates to Bit-isle, that one, there is less synergies perhaps, but overall a greater opportunity to fill up their \u2013 sorry, less cost synergies, pardon me, but a greater opportunity to enjoy revenue synergies because of the underutilization of their assets and that's where we're really excited about the opportunity coupled with some other ways that we think we can optimize the overall business. Again, we want to be a little bit reserved in our comments right now as we continue to think about our strategy, but overall in the next few quarters you will hear us talk more firmly about what's happening in the Bit-isle integration.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","If I could follow up briefly on the Telecity side, how are you managing the risk of customer confusion or potential disruption as you go through that process given that these are live environments and companies are being ring-fenced off depending on which part of the combined footprint they're in. Any color there as to how customer expectations are being set?","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, I mean I guess I would say it's not \u2013 this is not a new thing for us in terms of acquisitions, whereby a customer may come into Equinix having implementations from an acquisition as well. We have a strong client service management team that's applied to each of the customers to understand what their combined footprint looks like. They continue to get the service levels that they are contracted for and expect from both of those. Obviously, it doesn't come necessarily without any hiccups, but we have client service managers that are applied to those accounts to deal with issues as they arise. And that's \u2013 so that's how we're doing it in terms of customers that are keeping or maintaining a footprint between both facilities. In some cases, a more challenging one might be where we are actually separating out the assets associated with the divestiture and that is a more complicated process in that sort of perhaps against their will to some degree. A customer may be sort of splitting their implementation now between Equinix and between the eventual buyer of the Cheetah (60:42) assets. That is a delicate customer communication. It's one that we would prefer have not to have had to do, but it was unfortunately the European commission didn't cooperate in that regard. And so, it's simply a matter of us being clear and consistent with the communications to the customer and then stepping \u2013 and then standing up the what we refer to as \u2013 standing up to divestiture organization or the divested organization to be fully capable of responding to that. What I would say is, we spent an enormous amount of money to make sure that that divestiture goes out in a way that makes it readily operable on day one to serve those customer needs.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","And Jon, I guess I'll add to Charles that there are fairly clear solicitation rules that we have to govern by once the divestiture is made, but we cannot solicit those customers and they're pretty clearly laid out. So, that's all being implemented through the process.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Your line is now open.","Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi; good afternoon. Just on the UK and in particular, is there \u2013 has there been any impacts on the leasing side from the pending vote on the EU referendum? And you mentioned in your guidance that \u2013 in your updated guidance that Telecity might be tracking towards the low end. And I'm just trying to triangulate some of these things and then maybe kind of also in terms of the MRR per cabinet in that market?","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Paul, let me start first. I would say, overall when it comes to the UK, certainly, there is a lot of \u2013 there is some level of uncertainty that's been created with the Brexit. We as a company when we see the performance of the business, I would say there is nothing meaningful that would indicate that we're seeing a slowdown. I think the challenge that when we talked about \u2013 we had a commentary on Telecity more trending towards the lower end of the range, that's really more associated with the fact that we're taking two organizations, we're putting them together. When we gave our initial guidance, we didn't have the data and the visibility we have. Now, we're just refining our numbers because we have much more clarity on what we think we can do as a business, but at the same time aligning our sales force and delivery teams to meet the expectation. I think the other thing, again, Steve and Charles, I think both alluded to the fact that because we have the benefit of being able to import many of these global deals into markets and London being one of our stronger market, we see that as an opportunity and the number of three region deals that are in our pipeline today, perhaps not scientifically, but I would say is probably larger than we've seen in a long time. And so that gives us confidence with London and Amsterdam being some key nodes on those typical global deployments, that continues to be an opportunity for us. So overall, I wouldn't say anything meaningful yet, but we're certainly going to pay attention to it and we are monitoring it. We do get a number of questions from our investors on that subject matter, but it's a bit early to say with any confidence that there's any real impact from this potential Brexit matter.","Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks and then you talked about growing the interconnections here outside the U.S. I'm just wondering how close do you think you can get that component of the business to the density that you're seeing in the U.S. and kind of maybe both in terms of Europe and Asia PAC?","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Yes, it's a hard question to answer. There is a variety of different \u2013 obviously Western Europe is clearly a fully deregulated telecom market. And so network density is something that does really benefit customers in a similar way, but they started from a place where interconnection was really sort of, as Keith earlier referenced, sort of packed in and not really clearly delineated as part of the value proposition, and so it's been a bit of a journey for us in terms of being more clear with customers about the distinctive and extraordinary value they're getting from cross connects, and so whether or not you could achieve the same levels that we do now, which are in the north of 20% in the U.S., it's hard to tell. But I do think that we certainly continue to see upside opportunity in both regions to meaningfully improve those, both through quantity and price levers that are available to us, and so I think they'll filter north for sure. Whether or not they can get to those same levels, I don't know, but I think they can go meaningfully higher than where they are today.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Yeah and the only thing I'd add, Paul, it's a good question, is on a global basis, you can see inside the slides that we run interconnection as a percent of revenues about 16% on a global basis. As Charles just said, it was developed in a different way in Americas and we're roughly 23% interconnection as a percent of revenue in the Americas, 13% in Asia and that's been growing and an 8% in Europe. So to your point and to Charles' point, the largest opportunity to continue to grow the interconnection part of our value proposition exists there and we did it on the back of the acquisition we did when we first went into Europe and we changed that business to enable it and certainly with the mix of three region and multi-region customers that understand the value, as Charles said, of interconnection, it will migrate in that direction, but it will take time.","Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","Great, thank you guys. I wanted to talk about your guidance. So, in the first quarter, you just did 16% organic growth and your guidance I believe for the year you raised it from 13% to 13.4%, but obviously that implies then that at some point you can't be below 13.4% to average that number for the full year. It just \u2013 I'm having a hard time understanding what would happen over the next three quarters to see that type of deceleration in the business? I was wondering if you could give us some color on that.","And then you talked about it very briefly in your prepared remarks, but cabinet net adds were 1,500, and the last I think three or four quarters have been north of 3,000. You talked about timing, but it was lower, at least versus our numbers in each of the regions. I was wondering if you can us a little bit more specificity when you say timing and what's giving you the confidence that we'll see that rebound? And should we think it's going to get back to that, call it 3,000-plus level is really the second quarter? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Great questions, Colby. So let me try and address the question on growth year-over-year versus what we're guiding to. So frankly what we've told you on a constant-currency basis that organic business can grow greater than 13.4%. Now as you recognize Q1 when you look at on a year-over-year basis it's 16% and so we're stepping \u2013 we're effectively stepping that down in the second quarter to midpoint of guidance of roughly 2.6% growth quarter-over-quarter if you're looking at the top end of the range 2.9% quarter-over-quarter growth. 60 basis points of that is coming from the fact that right now we're assuming that non-recurring revenue will be $5.5 million less in Q2 than it was in Q1. So number one, there is an element of what's going on in the non-recurring space. Number two, when we look at that second half of the year, one of the things that we're really \u2013 given the level of activity and other matters that are affecting the combination of the business is between Bit- isle, Telecity and ourselves, we are very much \u2013 we're being very disciplined in what we want the future guidance to be, right now we're leaving as greater than 13.4% and that's really a reflection of there is a lot of activity that's taking place in the company right now, and because of that we want to make sure we continue to have a relatively conservative view on what it means for the back half of the year. Notwithstanding the fact though we are working very hard, as I said, to integrate the businesses and between the integration of the businesses and running the organic business, we're optimistic that we can continue to scale the business or to grow the business on a year-over-year basis greater than that 13.4%, but it's a little bit premature to commit to that today. And I'm sorry I've forgotten the second.","Stephen M. Smith - Chief Executive Officer & President","Second one was around the billable cab \u2013 billable cab adds.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. As it relates to billable cab adds, there is a couple of things that are certainly affecting that number. First and foremost, it's the size of the deals that we've looked at. The average size of deal that we did this quarter is a lot greater than the averages that we saw in the prior quarters. So, that's number one. We didn't do a lot of, what I would call, larger footprint of deals in the quarter.","Number two, as you know, we've rolled out a new basic quote to cash platform and that quote to cash platform is putting a little bit of \u2013 it's new in the system it's different for our customers, it's different for our employees and so as we continue to refine, if you will, our platform, we think that that's going to continue to increase the number of cabinet add. Number three, I would tell you that our pipeline and our backlog is, and more particularly the backlog, is higher than it has been before. And as a result, there is that, that is going to give us confidence that it's going to come into the revenue stream and ultimately to the billing cabinets.","And then the fourth thing I would say is, look, this is an area that we've seen before. It generally relates to things that happened near our end of quarter. Churn is a perfect example. Last quarter, as you recall, we referred to a UK-based churn, a relatively large churn that would affect not only our churn MRR metric, but also affects the number of cabinets, because the customer is affectively there for the entire quarter and then it churns out, and so you lose those cabinets. No different this quarter, we had a number of churn activities that happened in the back end of the quarter. And they were cabinet c and as a result, it reduced the overall level of cabinets billing. Bottom line is, we're optimistic that you're going to see that number rebound, we have seen it before, this pattern, and it's something that we'd anticipate changes as we look to the latter part of the year. The one thing that you can get great confidence in is irrespective of what that number is because it's a calculated metric, we are continuing to drive our revenues up and you can see by the guidance that we provided that we would expect to deliver $22 million of incremental revenue Q2 over Q1, which is a strong indication that we have got a number of billing cabinets in the system.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","Great.

Our business is performing well as we capture the shift to the cloud and continue to win by providing unparalleled global reach, strong interconnection capabilities, and high service quality. Robust demand on Tier-1 markets is driving higher utilization levels and we are investing in support of this momentum with additional builds and continued land purchases, particularly in our top tier markets.","This is complemented by targeted inorganic activity to expand our footprint and extend our scale into more key markets. Strong execution of our strategy is translating to rapid growth in our customer base and our go-to-market teams added record new wins across every vertical with notable outperformance from enterprise and financial services customers.","As customers embrace hybrid and multicloud as the IT architecture of choice, our interconnection strength is resonating, and Equinix continues to outpace market growth and gain share. Our healthy bookings in the third quarter were fueled by strong growth in our network and enterprise verticals, in particular strength in both the European and Asia-Pacific regions.","As depicted on slide 3 of our presentation, third quarter revenues were $1.152 billion, up 10% from the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $550 million for the quarter, up 10% over the same quarter last year, and AFFO growth was 16% year-over-year. These growth rates are in a normalized and constant currency basis, and demonstrate our strong operating performance.","Interconnection revenues grew 17% year-over-year, continuing to outpace colocation revenues and reflecting the success of our interconnection and ecosystem centric strategy. We saw a healthy pace of cross-connect ads with over 248,000 cross-connects now deployed.","Our Internet Exchange platform, the largest in the world, continues to see healthy growth with traffic volumes up 17% year-over-year, as customers begin to scale capacity in 100 gig port increments. We also saw traction with the Equinix Cloud Exchange, now serving over 950 customers and delivering strong EMEA growth this quarter.","Our product strategy is leveraging our unique position in the market as a global interconnection platform for enterprises and service providers of all kinds. We are currently pursuing opportunities to strengthen our interconnection leadership, including expanding the geographic reach of our services, as well as adding new features that provide customers additional flexibility, choice and commerce enablement support. These new offerings are in beta and some will be coming out to market formally before the end of this year.","Our geographic reach is unmatched and continues to grow with our global footprint now extending to 190 data centers across 48 markets, comprising over 19 million gross square feet of capacity. Our top-10 customers are deployed on average in 60 IBX facilities and represent the largest cloud, networks and enterprises in the world. This metric is increasing and speaks to both our investment in systems and processes to ensure a globally consistent customer experience, as well as the needs of our customers for a distributed digital edge.","This quarter, over 59% of our revenue came from customers deployed across all three regions, up from 58% last quarter, while 84% came from customers deployed across multiple metros. We remain committed to pressing our advantage globally through targeted acquisitions. And early in the fourth quarter, we closed two new transactions in EMEA. We purchased Itconic, a leading connectivity and cloud infrastructure solutions provider in Spain and Portugal for approximately $253 million. This purchase adds five data centers, and extends our footprint into two new European countries. It adds more than 400 customers including many marquee enterprise brands, and more than 100 network and mobile providers. The deal also gives us access to key locations where subsea cables land and connect through Iberia, positioning us to support the growth in direct traffic between Europe, Africa and Latin America and further extends our leadership position in the subsea market.","We also expanded in Turkey, purchasing our second IBX in Istanbul for $93 million. This owned data center further strengthens the Equinix's position in Istanbul, a strategic gateway between Europe and Asia with critical economic and geopolitical importance. It provides Equinix with key capacity in a campus environment, and a growth path which enables us to address continued demand for colocation and interconnection services in Turkey.","The Verizon data center acquisition completed in May continues to gain momentum. These assets have dramatically boosted our scale in the Americas, delivering strong performance out of the gate across all metrics. We are addressing pent-up demand by unlocking capacity in key facilities, and have approved new expansions in both Miami's NAP of the Americas and in Denver and expect to move forward shortly with additional capacity expansions in the coming year. We have made progress to stem the previous level of churn, and are enjoying significant success cross-selling into the Verizon assets from Equinix customers.","Our federal business is also progressing nicely, and we are growing the team to support this opportunity as we scale in this sector. Integration of the Verizon assets is moving quickly and we expect to have the majority of this work done by year-end. Early this quarter, we cut over from Verizon systems to the Equinix operating systems for all 29 data centers, marking a significant milestone for the integration program. We recognize with pride the incredible planning and execution work that all teams have completed to reach this point.","As it relates to both the Telecity and Bit-isle integrations, we have now completed the vast majority of these efforts and have recognized substantial benefits from the expanded platform in our European and Japanese markets.","Now, let me make a few comments on our organic development activity. We recently opened two new IBX's in Ashburn and Hong Kong adding capacity in some of our most important and interconnection rich campuses. We have 22 expansion projects underway across our platform, half of which are in EMEA, currently our most utilized region. We also purchased our D\u00fcsseldorf DU1 asset for $16 million and are progressing well with additional land purchases in EMEA and the United States.","Revenues from owned assets now represent 43% up from 42% last quarter highlighting continued progress in this metric. Our capital investments are delivering healthy growth and strong returns as shown on slide 4. Revenues from our 99 stabilized IBX's grew 5% year-over-year largely driven by increasing cross-connects and power density. These stabilized assets are generating 30% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested and utilization moved up to 84%.","Now let me shift gears and cover the highlights from our industry verticals. We are pleased with our progress across our industry verticals as we see seed and curate high value ecosystems. As digital business transformation permeates across all industries, we added a record number of new wins across every vertical this quarter through our channel and direct sales teams. We also added 10 new Fortune 500 wins across enterprise and financial, including a multinational pharmaceutical company, deploying performance hubs for real-time analytics and data management and a global retailer integrating business platforms to enable in-store insights.","Now starting with the networks. Our network vertical achieved its third consecutive record bookings quarter. Growth in this vertical is being driven by cable and satellite TV operators as they upgrade their infrastructures to support increased traffic volumes and compute requirements driven by video-on-demand, streaming and other digital services.","In addition, many of our global carrier customers are extending coverage in multiple metros and adding Cloud Exchange to their portfolio of services. Expansions this quarter included Charter Communications, China Telecom, Telstra and Verizon. We also see momentum within the subsea space, Seaborn Networks and Aqua Comms two leading subsea cable operators in Latin America and EMEA are interconnecting their submarine cable systems within Equinix's Secaucus campus. This solution will now create the most direct route between Brazil, New York, and London, three of the most vibrant financial exchange markets in the world.","In financial services, we continue to diversify capturing growth not only in capital markets but also in insurance and commercial banking sub-segments. This vertical is experiencing strong digital transformation. Firms continue to shift to cloud-based self-service and to distribute customer and risk analytic platforms across multiple locations.","In addition, privacy and compliance regulations are driving increased requirements to manage distributed data. Customer wins and expansions included American Family Insurance one of the largest property and casualty insurance groups and Invesco, a Fortune 500 investment management firm expanding to support mobile applications.","In content and digital media vertical, we saw solid bookings led by the Asia Pacific region and healthy growth in gaming, e-commerce and publishing. Globally, we continue to see expansion of the advertising ecosystem, enabling of the digital content in the cloud and acceleration of the transformation of content to the edge.","Additionally, Chinese content led hyperscalers are increasingly utilizing Platform Equinix to support their growing user requirements, placing content closer to the edge to reduce latency and optimize the user experience. Expansions this quarter included Alibaba, Baidu, Blade, Netflix, Priceline and Tencent.","The cloud and IT services vertical saw a continued strength this quarter, particularly with software-as-a-service providers, expanding at Equinix including, Oracle, SAP and Salesforce.com, all of whom can be reached with virtual private interconnections over the Equinix Cloud Exchange. Cloud service providers are re-architecting their networks, further expanding their customer aggregation points with additional access nodes and bringing more core services to the edge. We have the leading share of cloud edge deployments by a wide margin and our global platform is designed to meet the increasing need that many enterprises have for hybrid cloud architectures.","And finally, turning to the enterprise vertical, we saw strong growth in the majority of our sub-segments, led by EMEA, as customers begin to expand from single site, single cloud connections to multi-site, multi-cloud deployments. Enterprise use of cloud connectivity continues to evolve, addressing numerous use cases including performance improvement, cost reduction, security enhancement and digital enablement. New wins and expansions included Walmart which continues to invest in digital commerce, utilizing cloud deployments and Westrock, a Fortune 500 global packaging solutions provider.","Our focused channel efforts are paying off with 19% of bookings originating from the channel this quarter. Partners are starting to build their value added services around our core offerings including Cloud Exchange and Performance Hub. We are working together with these resellers to productize our joint offering to bring to our customers the benefits of the Equinix infrastructure enhanced by our partner services. Examples of joint offerings include Datapipe delivering reliable voice-over-IP to Ontario Systems as well as NetApp and Datalink working with Equinix to serve a Medical Association customer with a multicloud disaster recovery solution. We believe the continued development of our channel is a critical lever to providing us reach and scale to drive sustained revenue growth and increase our market share.","So, let me stop here for a minute and turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. I'd like to start by highlighting that we had another very solid quarter of bookings across our entire platform. As planned, we had our highest gross bookings production this quarter with particular records in both the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions, as well as our network vertical. And our net bookings were consistent with our expectations.","Our key operating metrics remained strong including firm MRR per cabinet. Also, we had a nice step up in net cabinets billing and net cross-connect additions. We continue to extend our platform reach and depth with strategic acquisitions, and our recently completed Itconic transaction marks our 20th acquisition to-date.","The strategic rationale for the Verizon asset acquisition continues to play out strengthening our global market leadership and giving us additional capacity to meet customer demand. These assets continued to be accretive to our operating margins including adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, and we're working hard to reduce the level of MRR churn previously experienced in this business. As we progress with the integration and asset level reviews, we continue to take a prudent view on our needs for sales reserves and estimates for forward-looking churn. The Americas sales force is delivering a combined strong performance with higher than planned bookings into the Verizon assets.","Overall, we've raised our key guidance results to reflect the strength of our platform including raising revenue specifically attributed to the Verizon assets. For integration costs we're updating our guidance to $54 million for 2017, which includes $22 million of costs related to the Verizon asset acquisition, $30 million related to Telecity and Bit-isle and $2 million for our Itconic and Istanbul 2 expansions.","Now turning to the third quarter. Q3 was another strong quarter of operating performance. As depicted on slide 5, Global Q3 revenues were $1.152 billion, up 3% over the prior quarter and 10% over the same quarter last year. This includes $137 million of revenues attributed to the Verizon assets. Do note that all growth rates in this section are normalized in constant currency. Q3 revenues ahead of our FX hedges included a $10 million positive currency benefit when compared to the Q2 average FX rates and an $8 million positive currency benefit when compared to our FX guidance rate due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar.","Our Global platform continues to expand with Asia-Pacific and EMEA showing growth over the same quarter last year of 13% and 12% respectively, while the Americas region produced a steady growth of 8%. We added a healthy 4,500 net billing cabinets. A meaningful step up from last quarter and we added 5,700 net cross-connects in the quarter, a continuation of our strength across our interconnection service offerings. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $550 million, up 10% over the same quarter last year.","Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 49% excluding integration costs, or 48% on an as-reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA includes $14 million of combined integration cost, lower than our expectations.","Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, had a $5 million positive benefit when compared to the Q2 average FX rates, and a $4 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates. Global Q3 AFFO was $391 million, up 16% over the same quarter of last year, and absorbs the modestly higher recurring capital expenditure number. Q3 global MRR churn was 2.3% including Verizon. We expect our fourth quarter MRR churns to continue to be in the 2% to 2.5% range.","And now, I'd like to provide a few highlights on the regions for the quarter, which the results are covered in slides 6 through 8. The Americas region saw solid revenue and adjusted EBITDA from both the organic business and the Verizon assets, an outcome attributed to having a diverse set of 87 assets across the Americas platform. And our fill rate and core interconnection metrics all improved quarter-over-quarter. Our team has also weathered two major hurricanes in Houston and Miami with no customer outages or any significant damage due to the team's dedication and strong planning.","EMEA delivered its third quarter of record bookings lead by our cloud vertical, as service providers expand across additional markets. Sustained growth is driving the next wave of campus expansions in our major EMEA markets, as well as many of the former Telecity metros for 2018.","Asia-Pacific delivered record bookings with strong performance in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. We also saw exports driving deals to other regions, particularly from the Chinese and Korean firms as their brands expand globally.","The Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA interconnection revenues were 22%, 14% and 9% respectively of recurring revenues, or 16% on a global basis.","Now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to slide 9. We continue to optimize our capital structure and take advantage of the currently low interest rate environment. This quarter we re-priced $1.8 billion of term loan B debt at lower rates exceeding our expectations. In September, we raised \u20ac1 billion at very attractive interest rates to both refinance our 2020 high-yield notes and to fund our continued investment in support of the demand that we see across our regions.","Selectively, these two financing transactions provided incremental $700 million of capital without increasing our annual interest rate expense. Our average rate of borrow across our key debt instruments is now 4.2% and we continue to believe a push investment grade is important to further drive down our borrowing costs and therefore increase our cash flows and accordingly AFFO and AFFO per share.","Unrestricted cash and investments increased to $1.6 billion, largely due to the incremental capital raised. Our net debt leverage ratio, net of unrestricted cash was 3.9 times or Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA has step down into our target leverage range.","Turning to slide 10 \u2013 pardon me. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $320 million including recurring CapEx of $45 million in line with our expectations. Currently, we have 22 new construction projects underway adding capacity in 16 markets around the world. The level of build is in response to strong supply and demand conditions across our operating markets, the depth of our pipeline and the level of inventory consumed over the past few quarters. We've recently opened nine new buildings or phases adding capacity in core markets including Amsterdam, Dallas, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London, and Toronto. And finally, please refer to slides 11 through 16 for our summary of 2017 guidance and our bridges.","For the full-year 2017, we're raising our revenue guidance by $37 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $10 million, an uplift that's a combination of improved operating performance, FX benefits and EMEA acquisitions. This guidance implies organic revenues will have a growth rate of 11% year-over-year and healthy adjusted EBITDA margin of 47%. The momentum of our business continues to drive AFFO and the AFFO per share. We're raising our 2017 AFFO guidance by $28 million. On a normalized and constant currency basis, AFFO is expected to grow 14% year-over-year. On an as reported AFFO per share basis, we're raising expectations to deliver $18.26 per share. We have an assumed weighted average of 77.5 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, including integration costs, AFFO per share is expected to be $18.97 a 2% increase over our prior guidance.","Turning to dividends. For 2017, we expect to pay out total cash dividends of $612 million, a 24% increase over the prior year and an AFFO payout ratio of approximately 43%. Consistent with the prior quarter, the Q4 cash dividend is expected to be $2 per share and will be paid out on December 13. And finally, we expect our 2017 capital expenditures to now range between $1.3 billion and $1.32 billion,","So, I'll turn the call back to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Keith. So in closing, we continue to deliver solid performance this year. Our strategy is working and we are executing at a high rate as we expand the depth, scale and reach of Platform Equinix and see continued momentum in existing and emerging ecosystems. The metrics that reflect our unique value continue to increase, including our multi-region customer deployments, traction with Fortune 500 customers and interconnection penetration. We are accelerating the growth of our ecosystems by bringing more network and cloud service providers to Platform Equinix, expanding the growth of our indirect channel and enhancing our product set to position our company to deliver even greater value to our customers going forward.","So let me stop here, and we'll open it up for questions. I'll turn it over to you, Christine.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we'll begin the Q&A session. And our first question is from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Just looking at some of the logos that you're highlighting, typically the names out of China, how meaningful a change is that in these names, you're seeing a big shift there, and then sort of a follow up on with Asia. Talk to us a little about the traction from the Bit-isle transaction. How is that tracking relative to the expectations with that acquisition? Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Okay, Frank. This is Steve. Why don't I start and then Keith and Charles can add here. So the logos that we refer to out of China, we're spending a dedicated amount of time with the large hyperscalers in China that are now expanding on a global basis. And so we have been over the last several quarters starting to win footprint with companies like Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba et cetera that are expanding their footprint, access nodes, network nodes, more compute around the world to enable their commerce enablement around the world. So we've been on that journey for quite some time and this quarter was another great quarter of wins with those three, for example, but there's others.","We have very small teams in Korea and also in Beijing, where we don't have assets today that are working with companies in those markets, South Korea that are exporting deals out around the world. So we had some pretty good wins this quarter also at South Korean companies and companies from Beijing, that are deploying infrastructure around the world. So the cross-border activity is working very, very well for us. Anything else on the logos from China, guys?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Well, I would add one more on the China, I think, which is \u2013 and it's not unique to China, but it is that this is a typical pattern for us, which is when we often work with players, in their home market, often they don't have an immediate need for us. They may either own data center assets or they may have other partners that they're using. But, we go in with that global value proposition and as they expand our business globally, they need somebody to help them do that. And we've been very successful in winning these customers, not only in their content digital media businesses, but in their cloud aspirations, and that's been a major impact.","And now, what happens and this happens a lot is we win that business, gain credibility with them and then often come back to the home market and are able to win business due to our extended relationship. And so, that's definitely something we're seeing.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","And Frank, let me just finish off with the question on Bit-isle. Clearly, as Steve alluded to we've almost fully integrated the Bit-isle asset and no surprise given our messaging we've been very pleased with the combination of that asset into our Japanese business. We've been able to sell off a number of the subsidiaries and assets that they own, that were not core to our go forward plan. So when you look across if you will the Japanese platform, we've been extremely pleased with how we performed and in fact, what we've seen is an actual uptick in Japanese activity across that broader platform, so we will continue to invest in the market and all I can say right now is we're very pleased with that transaction and we're happy we closed it.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan, your line is now open.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. It looks like the Verizon acquisition is going even better than expected. Can you dig more into what's driving that upside? It sounds like churn mitigation in particular is helping?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, Phil, there is a number of things that are certainly going well with the transaction. One of the things we said in the last earnings call, we continue to keep some level of conservatism or prudence in our guidance on a go-forward basis, is that we're seeing less churn and we've had to use less sales reserves than historically planned, so that's certainly a positive. But, I think the flip side is that we're selling, we're actually seeing gross activity where we're selling more into the business than we originally planned.","We're selling across that platform, as you know there is 600 net new customers. We're building out infrastructure where we can. We've recently announced an additional build in Miami's NAP of the Americas, the Denver asset as we're creating a lot of opportunity for ourselves. At the same time, we're putting a lot of focus on these assets, so when you take up sales force like we have, combine it with the Verizon assets and our assets, you have an opportunity to do better.","And so, when we started out offering guidance, it's just fair to say that we're conservative, we took a view that we wanted to understand the business better. For the very first time, those customers are getting invoices from Equinix on an un-bundled basis relative to what they experienced with Verizon. And so, we're delighted with where we ended the quarter, $137 million of revenues that annualizes out to just under $550 million. But, we're taking a view for Q4 that we're still going to be in that ZIP code of $130 million to $140 million of revenue for the fourth quarter and that's why we're holding our position because of our concerted view, our prudent view on incremental churn potential and\/or the need for higher sales reserves.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","It seems like your gross....","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. I might add two things. One, asset acquisitions like this \u2013 we're finding is a really ideal scenario in that, you don't have to do a sales force integration, move accounts around, figure out who's on first base, et cetera. Instead, you take the assets in, you say this is available capacity, we enable our sales team to come up to speed on that quickly, and begin selling into it aggressively. And we definitely saw that. In fact, I think we probably were a bit surprised at how effective the sales force was in immediately positioning these assets to their customers. And obviously, there's some tremendously high-quality assets in that portfolio.","And then you combine that with the fact that now these customers who had their services with the provider who they were questioning their long-term commitment to that business are now in a position of saying this is a customer who's absolutely committed to this, it's central to what they do, it's the only thing they do, they're the market leader, and they have an increased level of confidence to go ahead and spend behind that. And those two things in combination I think have really fueled the acquisition's performance.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you for the question. So, so far you've announced multiple data center facilities that have direct subsea cable landing point connections. Could you give us a better idea on the economics of these facilities? So, for instance, can you charge customers higher rates at these locations versus the rest of the IBXs?","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Well, this is Steve. Let me just kind of give you a baseline of there's \u2013 we've mentioned this in previous calls that there is some 40 to 50 subsea cable projects that have been going on for several quarters. We've announced several wins to date. Our intent around these is to help land these cables that today the technology is so advanced they can bring them further inland to where our data centers are located. We look very attractive because we have so many data centers located around the world. And once they turn these cables on, some of it will be dedicated, some of it would be undedicated, and the notion is that we can charge \u2013 we can obviously monetize space, power, and interconnection as they move that traffic around the world. So it's a very good win for us to land these things initially, but then when they finally turn these cables on, we're going to be able to interconnect that information and all that social media traffic and mobile traffic that all these hyperscalers are predicting are going to traverse the earth over the next decade. So a lot of the business is to come.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. It's a classic ecosystem play for us, right, which is we typically aren't going to generate the superior returns on the magnets themselves. It's on the ecosystem around that and a lot of these facilities are either in and of themselves or directly tethered to broader network, because this traffic comes in and, by the way, intercontinental traffic continues to explode because of the global nature of the economy. And so now once that data reaches the shores of where it's headed, it needs to be distributed cost effectively and efficiently, and that's really where we shine. And so I think that what we're able to do is monetize around those things and continue to attract people as a strategic point of aggregation.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it, got it. And then on Equinix Cloud Exchange, I was hoping you could give us an idea on how big this service as a percent of revenues currently is? Is it accelerating as a percent of total revenues currently?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yes. It's definitely accelerating. We have not broken it out, and I think we'll continue to evaluate whether that's appropriate to do. But it is definitely growing faster. If you look at interconnection overall 17%, which is clearly over-indexing, and Cloud Exchange is beginning to become a material contributor to the overall performance of the interconnection business. So, yeah, we're very pleased with that. It is a central hook in terms of being in the bag of our sales teams. When they go and say, 'Hey, are you implementing hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice? Let us talk to you about how Cloud Exchange can fit into that picture.' And so we're seeing really good momentum, both in terms of ports sold and particularly importantly, virtual circuits on those ports and traffic on the virtual circuits. So we monitor all of those things and all of those metrics continue to trend very nicely for us.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. All right. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. You line is now open.","Vincent Chao - RUBICON Technology Partners LLC","Yeah. Hey, guys. Just wanted to go back to the Verizon question for a second. It sounds like things are going quite well there. Guidance does imply a bit of a downturn in the fourth quarter, and I know there is some conservatism baked in, but just curious if there is anything specifically that's known that would cause that decline quarter-over-quarter?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, Vincent, I think very similar to what we did last quarter. As you know, we were running at a little bit higher level than what we guided to and no different this quarter. We're only two quarters into billing the customers. We're in the process of collecting those invoices. As I said on the prior question, the customers are receiving for the very first time unbundled invoices from Equinix. And as a result, as we work with the customers to make sure that we pay, we're agreeing all the terms and conditions and, if you will, the detailed line items, this is just us taking a prudent view as we look forward. And if I can then sort of analogize it to this acquisition to an acquisition we did in 2010 with Switch & Data, it took us almost 2.5 years to fully inventory all the assets. And so this is a process that we will be working with our local teams, to make sure we inventory them, yet at the same time as we invoice the customers, we want to make sure there's an appropriate reserve in-place for future potential churn but also sales reserves for things that are uncollectible. And again, this is us just being prudent with our guidance recognizing we are running a little bit faster than we've guided for Q4.","Vincent Chao - RUBICON Technology Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just maybe another question. Last quarter we spent some time talking about another wave or second wave of hyperscalers or hyperscale demand. It sounds like you did pretty well with that category this quarter. Could you potentially elaborate a little bit on how you are looking to change, how you approach that second wave, and try to capture it going forward?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, Vincent. This is Charles. So we see continued sustained demand from hyperscalers. I mean, we're having great success in selling them on various elements of their architecture. Our particular focus has always been on their network nodes and their private interconnection nodes, which we think are a central piece of building the cloud ecosystem and creating magnetism and fueling the ecosystem strategy that we have been so successful with.","We also, though, are seeing continued large footprint demand particularly from the hyperscalers. And as you know, we've been pretty selective about that business in the past, but we're hearing those hyperscalers, say 'Look, we really would like you to step up and provide some of those elements of our architecture in key locations for us as in our partner of choice, as an infrastructure partner of choice for us.' And we believe that stepping up and being more aggressive in that with a very select set of customers is the appropriate move for us. Their architectures are evolving in ways that we want to make sure that we're anticipating and staying in front of. We really feel like we need to maintain centrality in the cloud ecosystem, and these players, the ones that as you might imagine, are the ones we're focused on, are shaping that ecosystem quite aggressively. And so, what we're going to do is we're going to say, 'Look, we will work with you. We'll allocate some of our capital towards large footprint demand with those customers. We will optimize design construction, and deployment of those facilities to meet their needs. And then we'll be creative about how we finance that in terms of probably some combination over time of both on balance sheet and off balance sheet financing, which gives us the leverage that we need to serve those needs. So that's what we're up to. We're continuing to staff a team to help us do that effectively. The response from those customers has been extremely positive. And so we'll keep you updated as we continue to progress with that.","Vincent Chao - RUBICON Technology Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is now open.","Michael I. Rollins - Citi Research","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was curious if you could expand a bit more on what you were describing in terms of the interconnection products that you're looking to beta. And if you could talk a bit about the enterprise experience in your facilities of using the cloud and what you're seeing in terms of the evolving interconnection density from that? Thanks.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yes, Mike, I'll comment on that one and I think probably all of us having spent a lot of time with customers can comment on some of the enterprise applications that we're seeing really fuel the demand and particularly strengthen our new logo capture, which as you saw, we set records across all of our verticals in that regard. But starting with your question relative to the interconnection product portfolio, as you might imagine, we bring some very unique strengths to the table in terms of geographic coverage as well as cloud density. And what we've been hearing from our customers is, 'Look, we want to take full advantage of that. And so that's really what we've gone to work on and sharpened our pencil about saying, 'How do we provide ubiquity of access to the cloud destinations that our customers need from a geographic standpoint and from a cloud destination standpoint? And how do we make that as easy to use and consume as possible?' And so I'll kind of just leave it there and tell you, those are the areas of focus that we have in terms of extending the portfolio, and I would ask you to sort of keep your eyes out for more formal announcements that will be coming towards the end of this quarter.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","And, Mike, on your second question, I'll give you just a sense of some of the use cases that we're starting to see come in from the industry verticals. In the enterprise, we're seeing use cases that are around migrating to the hybrid cloud as you would expect as much as much positioning as we do with that. We've got retailers that are really pushing hard into digital commerce and creating the stores of the future. We have pharmaceutical companies that are deploying our performance hubs and looking for real-time analytics and data management capability.","In the financial industry, it's across the board. We've got connecting to multiple cloud cases, we've got investment firms that are doing that. They're deploying our performance hubs to extend their reach across multiple regions. In the cloud industry we're seeing all kinds of use cases from the cloud providers from security to storage to compute to governments that are actually using us around the world for all kinds of things, from healthcare applications to back to the security to DDoS and WAF capabilities, and they're finding that inside of our data centers with our partners and with us partnering with the providers of those services.","Network probably is \u2013 we had a very good quarter as we mentioned in finance and network, with the networks they're upgrading their backbones and they're moving to SDN and NFV, and so we're starting to see deployments towards a 100-gig and the networks are really starting to extend reach around the world with us for next-generation deployment of services, all oriented towards their capability to work with their cloud providers closer. So we're seeing all kinds of use cases. We're studying them hard, and we're really starting to dig into the top verticals that are really \u2013 that find the Equinix value proposition, a great place to drive cost out, and get higher performance.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Steve, one more I might mention is that honestly it has been a little surprising to me the strength of it has been manufacturing. We've seen incredible demand from manufacturing companies who are looking to do a variety of things ranging from supply chain management activities to data management to industrial Internet type use cases. And so that's a pretty exciting area for us.","And then one more comment, which would be I would say that we're seeing a higher propensity \u2013 a better success with what I would consider horizontal use cases. And so the good news about that is we're able to educate our sales teams on those use cases with a little bit of a vertical wrapper around it, but go send them out with something they understand well and that seems to be getting resonance across a wide variety of verticals. And so we definitely have both our sales teams and our solution architect teams who have some good vertical expertise, but horizontal use cases seem to be the wave right now.","Michael I. Rollins - Citi Research","Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much. You talked a bit about channel partners becoming more important getting up to about 19%. Where do you think that could go over time and what are the economics for you driving business through their channel versus directly. And then maybe just one, we talked a lot about the Chinese Internet providers. What's your thoughts about expanding in China? You've obviously continued to work in Shanghai, but in two other markets there. Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","I'll start with the channel. Charles, maybe you could chime in. So the channel has progressed nicely. We'll probably set a goal next year that will drive us into the 20%s, Simon. I don't think we know the upper limit of what percentage our channel can deliver. It's 19% now. We've had 14 quarters of sequential growth with our channel. So bookings grew 42% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter through the channel. We've really shifted the focus to resellers. We actually had about 143 new logos come from our resellers this quarter, and we're creeping up towards 430-odd new logos year-to-date through the resellers and through the channel partners. So it's working very well, and I would tell you that our expectations are to \u2013 it's 19% today. It's going to move into the 20%, the low 20%.We haven't set a goal out there publicly on where we want this to go, but it's increasing every quarter.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And are the economics similar from direct business?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, they are. I mean when you really look at it, you may have a particular right now where we're probably doing a bit more of sell-with activity than pure sell through. They might be a little higher in that you may be paying an end user rep to engage and co-sell with a channel partner. But when you really look at customer lifetime value and the cost of sale therefore in the context of a fairly long contract with strong margins, the incremental cost of sale is fairly small. So I would say on balance, they're similar economics. I would say that since enterprise is really over-indexing in growth and we really have a business that is \u2013 service providers continue to be very strong for us across a range of cloud service providers, networks, others. But on the enterprise side, I would say I think they could eventually be \u2013 the majority of our bookings could come through the channel on the enterprise side as offerings mature in the market and they're able to pull them through more effectively.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","And then, Simon, in China, China, we have six assets today that are in the Shanghai region in a joint venture partner that we've announced that we're working on to work with us closely to accommodate the licensing requirements we need to go deeper into the market. Our aspirations are to move up to the Beijing market over time. We have a very good joint venture partner that we're finalizing the terms. We've announced that company. It's a company called Datang and they are very well connected into the government circles and are providing us all the partnership benefits that you would expect to work with local companies.","Most of the traffic we're still seeing coming into PRC is inbound enterprise multinationals that need a safe pair of hands in China when they're setting up operations and majority of our business still is multinational traffic coming in. That will change over time as we get deeper into the partnership with Datang and we start to take on some local companies.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And is Beijing something that could happen in 2018?","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Yes, it could very well happen in '18.We're working hard on- our partner has access to land and to buildings and all the required things you need to move into a market like that. So it could very well happen in 2018.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Co. You line is now open.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Two questions, if I may. One, the Americas cross connect number was relatively low for the second quarter in a row, at least when we look back over the several quarters before that. Just trying to get if there's something structural or something that's changed there to get a sense of how we should be thinking about that going forward. And then secondly, as it relates to the two announced deals Zenium and Itconic, how many other opportunities really around the world do you see like that right now and how aggressive do you guys want to be right now in starting to roll some of those out? It seems like right now might be a good opportunity to kind of just push on that a little bit?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Colby, maybe I'll comment on the Americas cross connects and let Keith and Steve add to that and address the M&A question. But overall, I would say that we continue to be very pleased with sort of the interconnection performance. Obviously 17% year-over-year growth on interconnection is really demonstrating strong performance in this area and speaks to I think the depth of our value proposition in that.","Having said that, the cross connect counts probably three things that I would comment on: one, we are seeing some implementation of a 100 gig from our most sophisticated players who are implementing optics and would be able to aggregate traffic and groom their cross connect population and that does create some churn on the cross connect, but it increases the overall sort of traffic and throughput on the platform, which we think is a good thing over time. And so we are seeing some of that. We're also seeing the backend of I think some of the industry consolidation, which has been rampant in networks over the last several years . It takes them time to sort of integrate their core nodes and sort of groom traffic. And so we're seeing some of that. But what we really keep our eye on is gross, right, because you are going to see some churn on for some of these other reasons, but gross has been \u2013 continue to be very strong which to us says, look, the end demand for private connectivity continues to be strong. And so that's what we're seeing there.","And then finally, I would say those numbers don't reflect ports on the cloud exchange and VCs on those ports, and those are an increasingly popular way for people to gain the interconnection value that they need. So, those things all probably play into some degree. But on balance 5,700 is a number we're pretty pleased with. And again and when you really look at the revenue growth and how our customers react to our interconnection value proposition, we couldn't be happier.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","And on the M&A front, Colby, I would tell you that still the top priority for this team is reaching new markets and extending our networking and cloud platform to extend it into Equinix is the top priorities. The markets are the same. We're looking in Southeast Asia, we're looking in South Korea, India, South Africa deeper into Latin America. That's where the regional teams have activity going, corporate development activity. I would tell you there's no shortage of opportunities. We're going to qualify and be very targeted, but if it moves the needle for us on new market or moves the needle for us on network and cloud density, it'll be of interest and we'll probably have a look. I don't know Keith if you'd add anything there.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Perfect.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open.","Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. What percentage of undersea cable landings are in your own facilities and how do you think about the owned versus lease question when trying to land those deals?","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Owned versus leasing, you want to start on that, Keith?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. I think the first and foremost, let me take it to the highest level. Our view is always having fully economic control of the asset or any other asset that we'd like to wholly own. But there are certainly some of these markets where we will not have the opportunity to own the asset yet, having those subsea cables extending to that leased asset is just as valuable to us as it is into our owned assets. And I think that's most important. And I don't actually have the breakdown between the owned and leased, breakdown between the subsea cables that have already landed. But suffice it to say that is an area that we will continue to focus on to the extent that we can have more owned assets which is an objective of the company, that will bode well for what you're looking for.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","And on the wins to-date on the question, Lukas, we actually have around 28 metros that would be cable landing enabled meaning that our IBXs were close enough to the coast to be able to support a cable landing station deployment. We've announced publicly that we've won 15 today, there's eight in operation and seven are under construction, meaning they're deploying and getting ready to setup.","So per the earlier question, many of these cables have not yet even been turned on yet. These are all funded by the biggest hyperscalers in the world with their desire to have more capacity for all this traffic that's going to traverse the Earth over the coming decade. So, the turn up of these things will continue to happen. There's another 20 to 30 more projects that we are aware of that are ongoing and we're pursuing with business development teams. So, this is a high priority for us.","Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC","Great. And then, just to follow-up, with leverage at the higher end of your target range. How do you weigh either growing organically to bring that down or tapping the ATM?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Well, again, we have really strong capital structure today. We're at the high end of our range, we're previously above that high end of the range. Just through sheer scale, the cash flow attributes of our business are very, very strong. And just by growth, it will continue to bring that leverage ratio down. Having said that, we want to make sure we define what our best and best source of capital is to fund our future growth. We'll continue to use leverage where appropriate. We have $1.6 billion of cash in the balance sheet, we have an untapped line of credit. We do have an approved ATM that we previously announced. But right now, our use is really going to be the cash on the balance sheet and making sure that we can continue to scale the business in the most efficient way to drive the maximum value to our shareholders.","And just recognizing that, I like the position we are in, because as we continue to scale, we're creating more theoretical debt capacity for ourselves. And yet at the same time it's increasing the cash flow in the business that allows us to reinvest given the low payout ratio of 43%.","Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Line is now open.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. So I was interested if you can talk a little bit about your pipeline, over the next 18, 24 months for land purchases under sites where you currently lease. And then, just kind of bigger picture, as we think about the margin trajectory, obviously, when you do M&A, it can interrupt the margin expansion, what is keeping you from at some point readily surpassing the 50% threshold and heading towards say mid 50% margins or higher? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Let me take the first one and I'm looking at Steve and Charles maybe for the second one or I'm happy to jump in, but look, no surprise to you Jonathan. We are actively acquiring buildings and contiguous land in and around those buildings. If it make senses that we will continue to do that, we'll do as much of it as we can. We are highly focused on what we call the top-tier markets.","Think of that as sort of the 10, 15, you can probably even go up to 20 markets around the world where we want to make sure that we control our future destiny. We've also had a committed objective to get to more than 50% of our revenues coming from assets that are owned. So not only acquiring the land for our future growth but acquiring the land underneath the buildings in which we operate today is an objective of ours. And so over some period of time, you'll see that that number will continue to move up. But the most important thing I want you to walk away is that we are actively looking to acquire land in our core markets adjacent to or at least proximate to our existing facilities.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. I'll tackle the second one. I mean I think Amir actually asked the same question last time if memory serves, but I do think that there is natural margin expansion available to us in the business as we continue to scale. And so I think, we see some of that. As you said M&A has the occasional sort of blip in terms of interrupting that expansion trajectory. But the one thing I would say is, and we've been consistent I think in this, which is we view our own (5n6:43) as maximizing sustainable intrinsic value creation for the business. And we think there's a lot of opportunity out there right now, and we're investing behind that opportunity.","If you look for example at what we did in terms of kind of the adjustment in our organization to continue to tackle new growth areas for the business, and what my new SSI team is trying to go after, those are areas where we'll continue to invest behind to ensure that our service portfolio is responding to customer needs, and positioning us not only for near-term performance, but for long-term sustainable growth.","And so that's why we've been reluctant to put any different marker out there. I think we're continuing to progress towards margin expansion, and we'll make a balanced assessment of when we believe we should drop that through the bottom-line versus when we believe we're going to get a really significant return on that investment by putting it into future growth. So I think we're continuing on that march, but hesitant to sort of change how we view the long-term markers.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then finally on interconnect, on your website there's a product sheet that talks about your traditional Internet exchange product, and there's a number of blue dots across the globe that says coming soon around \u2013 basically putting in I would suspect kind of your peering exchange in those metros. And is that potentially going to be material driver of acceleration in your interconnect business or is that just sort of an amenity that is less important than say bilateral cross connects?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, I mean I would say that we try to think about the overall interconnection offering and make sure that it's being responsive to the broad needs of our customers. I don't know that any geographic expansion, we would do particularly on the IX is going to be \"needle mover.\" But I do think that what it does is positions us to effectively serve the full range of a customer requirement and what we have and it is quite unique is a combination of both geographic reach and product portfolio depth and interconnection which is really unmatched. And so you said look, a large complex global multinational, one, they need the geographic coverage, but two, they want to take it from the buffet, IX direct connectivity in the form of Layer 1 cross-connects, ECX at Layer 2, Layer 3 and nobody else can provide that full portfolio. So, again, I'd urge you to sort of stay tuned to how we're evolving the interconnection portfolio and you'll hear more about that through the course of the year.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is now open.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks guys. You saw a nice uptick in the cabinet adds in the quarter really across all markets. Now I know you don't guide to it and it's a fairly lumpy number, but given all the development and footprint expansion, is this sort of a good level that we could expect sort of going forward? And then if you could maybe point out one or two drivers, I mean on the call here you've mentioned probably a dozen that's driving the business, but if there's one or two that you could point out, maybe they're different in sort of each region, but is it accelerating pace of outsourcing or demand from the hyperscalers, anything you could point to that sort of drove that uptick particularly this quarter would be great? Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","For the cabinet adds.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, I think first and foremost 4,500 net cabinet adds clearly is, one, if not our highest, I think it's out highest bookings quarter ever vis-\u00e0-vis the net cabinets billing. I'd tell you that as you aptly pointed out, it does ebb and flow. One of the comments we made in our prepared remarks was the pipeline is extremely strong. And so, no surprise to you as we plan to have continued record bookings, because we're scaling the business. We'd expect that number to continue to be significant.","The other part I said is, we believe that we're going to continue to consume a lot of those cabinets. Hence the number of projects that we are building around the world as we said, we've got 22 active projects across 16 markets, and recognizing some of the comments made by Charles around hyperscaler and the opportunity that's in front of us. I think you're going to see that number continue to be relatively higher than what we've experienced before. But I want to reserve the right that it is inherently chunky. And so, we're going to see sometimes it will move upwards and other times it will step back just based on the timing of the deployments.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","And John, I would point back to what Charles talked about earlier on these horizontal use cases. So, it would be a combination of everything underneath an umbrella, most companies today are moving their businesses to a digital enablement model. So they're moving some applications to the hybrid multicloud architecture, they're optimizing their networks, they're transforming them. They're moving more data to distribute it around the world where the people and customers are, so they need more analytics out of the edge. They're moving their communications capabilities all over the world, their data centers are consolidating, so many enterprises are getting out of the data center business, moving some applications to the public cloud, moving some to the colo and keeping some on-premise. The concept that the edge computing model is underpinning a lot of these requirements we're seeing, so it's a combination of those things that we see across multiple industries.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","And, as you might have noticed, large CSPs, as you might have noticed this earnings season, are growing their business very well and they are significant customers of ours and we continue to benefit from that growth.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. So, when you mentioned large footprint deployments for hyperscalers earlier, I was just curious what scale of deployment you mean in terms of megawatts or what size of deployments or range are you talking about there? And secondly, are you able to provide a churn number that would exclude the sort of a core churn number that would exclude churn in the acquired assets?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","I'll take the first one. And then maybe, Keith, you can comment on the second one there. So large footprint, it is little bit of a terminology challenge which is \u2013 we probably still are doing \u2013 several years ago, we'd probably consider anything over 250 kilowatts sort of large footprint. That started to probably elevate in terms of what sort of average deployment sizes are for certain things, but when I'm talking about the hyperscale initiative in particular, we're talking more about sort of multi-megawatt, probably 3 megawatt to 5 megawatt or more in a single implementation, not a single phase, but in one implementation that comes over a relatively short period of time, and so when we're talking about hyperscale that's kind of the scale of what we're thinking of.","We will talk about doing large footprint within the context of our retail business that might be 300 kilowatts, 500 kilowatts, maybe even up to 1 megawatt, but we usually accommodate that within our retail footprint and within the underwriting that we've done for those assets already. So those are distinct things in our view in terms of large footprint which we're accommodating within our current assets. And then hyperscale which again I would say 2 megawatts to 3 megawatts to 5 megawatts or more over a relatively short period of time.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Robert, on the churn question the easy answer this quarter is (1:04:45) somewhat consistent with what we reported on an overall basis. So on the acquisitions are relative \u2013 or the inorganic versus the organic is roughly the same.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Great.

Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Katrina and good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. 2016 was a pivotal year for Equinix. We're capturing a shift to the cloud, expanding our global reach and scale, growing interconnection and delivering increasing shareholder returns. We are operating at the intersection of some of the greatest technology trends in our lifetime. The digital transformation driven by cloud services is shifting compute, storage and networking to the edge, which plays into our core advantages created by dense digital ecosystems and our global scale. Cloud is a major driver of our business and in 2016 we strengthened our momentum in capturing the cloud-enabled enterprise, positioning ourselves for continued success in this critical area.","We are the market share leader in the vast majority of our 41 markets and we're scaling significantly faster than our peers. We've invested over $17 billion in capital in our platforms since our founding with over $10 billion in acquisitions, including the Verizon assets, and the degree of difficulty to replicate what we've built is extremely high. Interconnection today is more important than ever. With our Telecity acquisition, we now have over 230,000 cross-connects and the leading position in the Internet exchange market, further demonstrating the strength and power of our interconnection platform.","We capped the year off by entering into a definitive agreement to purchase 29 Verizon data centers, increasing capacity in many of our key markets in North America and South America, further enhancing our interconnection density, and accelerating our scale and relationships in the government and energy sectors. Without a doubt, 2016 was a banner year and positions us to continue to deliver on the promise of Platform Equinix as the place where opportunity connects.","Our differentiated platform continues to drive our financial performance and we delivered another year of record bookings activity. As shown on slide three, we generated over $3.6 billion of revenue in 2016, up 14% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis.","We delivered over $1.65 billion of adjusted EBITDA, continuing to strengthen our margins while investing significantly in the business and expanding our addressable market. This drove AFFO growth of over 35% year-over-year on a normalized and constant-currency basis, exceeding our prior guidance.","For the fourth quarter, we had a great finish to the year, delivering our best-ever bookings with particular strength in enterprise, a key point of focus for the business. We added seven Fortune 500 customers this quarter, including a global clothing and accessories retailer and multi-national food manufacturing company and an American oil and gas operator.","We've now captured over one-third of the Fortune 500 and a quarter of the Forbes Global 2000 companies and are seeing significant land and expand behavior with these critical lighthouse customers.","We saw our highest growth coming from three region deployments as customers leverage our unparalleled geographic reach. This quarter, over 56% of our revenue came from customers deployed globally across all three regions and over 82% from customers deployed across multiple metros.","Next, I'd like to provide more detail on our interconnection services and review acquisitions and organic development. Starting with interconnection. Interconnection revenues grew 21% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis, significantly outpacing colocation revenues. The Telecity acquisition brought us a number of interconnection rich sites and we're now including in our count approximately 35,000 cross-connects from Telecity. As the Telecity business converts to our IT systems platform through 2017, we'll continue to refine this count and we expect these sites will continue to contribute additional cross-connect and interconnection revenue growth.","We also saw adoption of our cloud exchange with robust growth of ports, virtual circuits and traffic and now have over 625 customers using this platform to facilitate hybrid cloud as the architecture of choice. Our Internet exchanges also saw healthy growth in the quarter, with considerable provision capacity and traffic, fueled by strong underlying demand trends.","Turning to acquisitions, in 2016, we significantly extended our scale and reach with the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions in Europe and Japan, and we closed out the year ahead of plan with our synergy targets.","We're making great progress with our integration efforts around these assets, and are excited about the go-forward potential for 2017 growth and beyond. We continue to be active on the M&A front, including the recent purchase of an additional data center in Slough, west of London. This facility is in close proximity to Equinix's existing Slough data center campus, and will help meet growing demands for digital infrastructure connectivity in the United Kingdom and Europe, while allowing us to redeploy CapEx to other key markets.","The transformative acquisition in 2017 will be our $3.6 billion acquisition of Verizon's U.S. and Latin America data center portfolio, which we expect to close midyear. This is a unique opportunity to expand our Americas presence with network and enterprise-rich assets, and add core strategic hubs, including Miami's NAP of the Americas and the Culpeper campus in Virginia, which has significant traction with government customers.","We expect this to be a great acquisition for us, adding scale in new markets, combined with cash flow generation that will be accretive per share on day one, excluding our anticipated transaction and integration costs. With the expected completion of the Verizon asset acquisition and including our recently-owned open data centers, Platform Equinix will stand across now 179 data centers, 44 metros in 22 countries.","Turning to our development activity, we continue to invest and expand globally, putting to work over $1.1 billion in CapEx in 2016. We have 19 announced expansion projects underway, as we respond to strong supply demand conditions across all of our operating regions. This quarter, we are moving forward with five additional expansions in Amsterdam, Chicago, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, and Toronto, totaling $175 million of capital expenditures.","Through expansion on owned land and selected purchase of assets, we continue to increase our asset ownership, advancing toward our target of over 50% of revenues from owned assets. This quarter, we bought our Rio de Janeiro 2 facility in Brazil, as well as our Amsterdam 7 facility in the Netherlands.","With the Verizon asset acquisition, where the majority of the data centers are owned, revenues from owned assets will move up to 40% by midyear. Our capital investments are delivering very healthy growth and strong returns as shown on slide four.","Revenues from our 70 stabilized IBXs grew 5% year-over-year, largely driven by increasing cross-connect and power density. These stabilized assets are generating 32% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested and utilization remained at 87%. In the coming quarters, we'll expand this tracked metric to include additional stabilized data centers from Telecity and Bit-isle.","Now let me cover quarterly highlights from our industry verticals, starting with the networks. This vertical experienced substantial bookings growth led by the Asia-Pacific region, with expansions across wireline and wireless providers, including BT Global Services, Comcast, CenturyLink, China Unicom, Orange Business Services, and Verizon.","We continue to nurture and expand our network ecosystem with a focus on cable operators, satellite and wireless providers, as they invest in their infrastructure to address demand for cloud, mobile and digital services. We also are maintaining significant momentum as a strategic partner with new submarine cable projects, and are winning additional edge deployments.","The financial services vertical experienced strong bookings, led by the Americas and our diversified penetration of this vertical beyond electronic trading into banking, wealth management and insurance. The insurance sub segment continues to see strong growth, with three of the top five insurance providers expanding with Equinix this quarter. Growth with these providers is being driven by a shift to cloud-based self-service, risk analytics being distributed to multiple locations, and requirements to manage distributed data due to privacy and regulations.","Beyond insurance, key wins included AmeriHome Mortgage, a top-15 U.S. mortgage company, using interconnectivity solutions to provide low latency resiliency, Boeing Employees Credit Union, a financial cooperative, and Eton Park Capital, a global investment firm.","In the content and digital media vertical, growth was led by the advertising and CDM segments. We continue to nurture and expand the advertising exchange ecosystem globally, adding premier ad-tech companies such as Index Exchange. We are also capturing traditional media and entertainment players, making the digital transition \u2013 helping them make the digital transition, winning new disruptive entrants that provide over-the-top content and capturing key deployments with large broadcast companies and streaming media solution providers.","The cloud and IT services vertical achieved solid bookings buoyed by our performance in Europe. We are building our position as the home of the interconnected cloud by increasing cloud density with the major infrastructure-as-a-service players, such as AWS, Microsoft, IBM SoftLayer, Google Cloud Platform and Oracle, who on average have a presence across 15 markets with Equinix and continue to grow. In addition, software-as-a-service providers are now joining our cloud exchange to provide the performance and security benefits of private interconnection to their customers and this year, Salesforce.com, SAP and ServiceNow are deploying across multiple markets. Security SaaS providers are also offering their services on cloud exchange, including F5 and Incapsula as well as unified communication providers including BlueJeans, RingCentral and others.","Turning to the enterprise, this critical growth vertical achieved record bookings, led by Asia-Pacific and three-region deployments. We captured new enterprises that are embracing interconnection-oriented architectures by redesigning infrastructure to directly and securely interconnect their people, locations, clouds and data. Wins included Philips, a global 400 manufacturer connecting to AWS, Azure and SoftLayer in multiple locations, as well as expansions from Walmart, who is further investing in ecommerce by optimizing its network topology connecting to Azure via our cloud exchange.","And finally, we continue to enhance our go-to market engine through both direct and indirect channels. We are steadily adding between 150 and 200 new customers a quarter with cloud and enterprise accounting for two-thirds of these adds. We now have over 8,500 customers and expect growth in enterprise wins to significantly expand this number over the coming years. Our channel program now accounts for roughly 15% of total bookings with two-thirds of this activity from resellers.","In 2017, we will focus our channel efforts on driving greater partner productivity through program simplification, enhanced partner activation efforts and joint offer creation, targeted largely at the massive market for the cloud-enabled enterprise.","So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Keith?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. As Steve highlighted, we're very pleased with the overall performance of the business and our momentum sets us up nicely for 2017. We're tracking well against the expectations laid out at the 2016 Analyst Day, seeing healthy revenue growth, improving adjusted EBITDA margins and strong flow through to AFFO.","I'll start my prepared remarks with a review of the full-year 2016 and then offer some high-level commentary on 2017. Then I'll toggle to our acquisitions and finish with some fourth quarter highlights.","So starting with revenues, we reported revenues of over $3.6 billion for 2016, a greater than 14% year-over-year organic and constant-currency growth rate, as we benefited from our global reach and scale and our healthy interconnected ecosystems. For 2017, we expect to deliver normalizing constant-currency growth of greater than 11%, which now includes the slower growing, yet highly-accretive acquisitions in our run rate.","As I stated, we will enter 2017 in a very strong position and we expect to deliver higher levels of bookings and strong incremental revenue in the year compared to 2016, after adjusting for the LinkedIn churn.","Switching to foreign currencies. FX remains volatile and the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen against many of our operating currencies, resulting in a net $86 million headwind to our as-reported growth in 2017. Our current FX hedges have proven to be very effective during this volatile period, meaningfully offsetting an otherwise even larger headwind.","For 2017, we've already hedged over 55% of our EMEA revenues and cash flows, and we expect our hedge position to increase over the year, as we continue to integrate Telecity entities into our EMEA business.","In 2016, we improved our normalized and adjusted EBITDA margin to 47.5%, an 80 basis point improvement over the prior year, making progress towards our long-term 50% adjusted EBITDA margin target. We expect to deliver additional margin improvement in 2017, yet we continue to invest in growth initiatives, while maintaining appropriate discipline to scale the business opportunity in front of us.","For 2017, we expect our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins to be 47.6%, excluding integration costs or 46.8% on an as-reported basis, which includes $16 million of higher utilities and property taxes in the EMEA region. For 2016, our normalized AFFO, which excludes the impact of the Telecity FX loss and the integration costs was $1.196 billion, significantly higher than expected for the year.","Looking-forward on a normalized and constant-currency basis, 2017 AFFO is expected to grow 13% over the prior year, reflecting strong flow through from adjusted EBITDA to AFFO. On an AFFO per share basis for 2017, we expect to deliver $18.07 per share on a normalized basis, or $17.19 per share on an as-reported basis, which includes the negative carry from our December financing, the FX headwinds, our integration costs, but that does not yet include the benefit expected from the Verizon asset acquisition.","We have assumed a weighted average 72.7 million in common shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis. Looking at 2018, including the full-year benefit from the Verizon asset acquisition, we expect our AFFO per share to continue to show strong momentum.","Let me discuss the acquisitions. We expect the Verizon transaction to be a highly compelling acquisition that will expand our market position across the Americas region. From a financial perspective, we expect these assets to generate an estimated $450 million in revenues for the first 12 months post close, driving adjusted EBITDA margins of 60% accretive to our current operating levels. As we move to close and integrate this deal, the increased scale and reach will enable continued margin expansion, while creating significant value for our platform as well as our shareholders.","With respect to Telecity and the Bit-isle acquisitions, the integrations have gone very well, thanks in large part to our committed team and leadership. We're on track to achieve our targeted cost synergies by the end of 2017 with the majority of the cost savings already captured in the Q4 run rate.","We are more than halfway through the Telecity integration having completed the integration of the Dutch, UK, German and Irish business units, and we expect to complete the remaining countries before the end of the year.","As we enter into another busy year on the integration front, we expect to incur approximately $30 million in integration costs in 2017, which includes work to finalize the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, as well as $2 million of Verizon asset integration costs for Q1 only.","Now turning to the fourth quarter. Q4 was another strong quarter of operating performance with revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO above our expectations. As depicted on slide five, global Q4 revenues were $942.6 million, up 3% over the prior quarter and 13% over the same quarter last year. On an organic and constant-currency basis, Q4 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $6.6 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used in Q4 \u2013 last quarter and a $2.5 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rate due to the stronger U.S. dollar.","Our global platform continues to expand with Asia-Pacific and EMEA showing organic and constant-currency growth over the same quarter last year of 17% and 14% respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 10%. Our as-reported revenues include $138.4 million from our acquisitions, consistent with our expectations.","And note, on a going-forward basis, given the substantial integration of the Telecity and Bit-isle businesses, Q4 is the last quarter we will breakout this detail. Our MRR per cabinet yield continues to remain strong. We added 2,800 net billable cabinets and 5,500 net cross-connect additions in the quarter.","And starting for the fourth quarter, our metrics now include MRR per cabinet and cross-connects for both the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions. Telecity adds 38,500 cabinets to the cabinet inventory at a utilization rate of 78%, with a slightly lower MRR per cabinet, while Bit-isle adds 6,300 cabinets at a 52% utilization rate. We will continue to refine these acquisition metrics as we complete our integration efforts.","Global adjusted EBITDA was $436.5 million, up 3% over the prior quarter and 16% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis, despite the higher-than-planned commission expenses related to our record bookings this quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA includes approximately $15 million of integration costs. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46.3%, a step-up over the prior quarter, largely due to the acquisition-related entries that lowered the EMEA's adjusted EBITDA in Q3.","Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance net of our FX hedges had a $2.1 million positive benefit compared to the average FX rates used last quarter, and a $3.7 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates.","Global AFFO was $294 million, up 3% over the prior quarter, largely the result of improving adjusted EBITDA. AFFO on a normalized and constant-currency basis increased 24% over the prior year.","Moving to churn. Q4 global MRR churn was 2.4%, consistent with our targeted churn range. Looking at 2017, we continue to expect MRR churn to average 2% to 2.5% per quarter, which includes the elevated churn of approximately 3% in Q1 related to the final phase of LinkedIn's bifurcation strategy. As expected, LinkedIn churned 1,300 cabinets out of the Americas region at the beginning of the quarter, while retaining their interconnect-rich footprint at Equinix.","The team is working hard to backfill the space with line of sight to a number of ecosystem-enhancing deals and we look forward to updating you on our progress.","I'd now like to provide highlights on the regions whose full results are covered on slides six through eight. The Americas region had its second highest bookings quarter of all time, driven by our content and financial segments, with ongoing strong outbound production to the other two regions.","EMEA delivered a record bookings quarter with particular strength in our German and Dutch markets and strong interconnection growth. On the cost side, we're seeing higher utility costs in the UK, offset in part by our energy hedges. Asia-Pacific had record bookings, remained our fastest growing region with strong momentum in our Singapore and China markets, driven by our network and enterprise verticals.","Interconnection revenues continued to outpace our overall growth of the business. The Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA interconnection revenues all moved up to 24%, 12% and 8%, respectively of recurring revenues or 16% on a global basis.","As I look in the balance sheet, please refer to slide nine. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet raising \u20ac1 billion in the fourth quarter. This debt raise not only partially funded the Verizon asset acquisition, but also allowed us to place a natural euro-based hedge into our capital structure. This euro denominated debt in combination with the $2 billion bridge financing, our unused revolving line of credit and the cash on the balance sheet provide us great flexibility to fund the Verizon deal.","It remains our intention to raise both additional debt and equity to finance the Verizon transaction, while appropriately balancing our capital structure to maintain our strategic and operational flexible.","Unrestricted cash and investments increased to approximately $1.82 billion, after taking into consideration the euro-based financing funded in early January 2017. Our net debt leverage ratio net of our unrestricted cash was about 3.5 times our Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA.","Now switching to AFFO and dividends on slide 10. For 2017, we expect our as-reported FFO to be greater than $1.249 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase. On a normalized basis, AFFO would be greater than $1.313 billion, demonstrating the continued strength of our operating model.","Turning to dividends, in 2016 we returned approximately $500 million back to our shareholders. Today, we announced our Q1 dividend of $2 a share, a 14% step-up over the prior quarterly cash dividend per share. For 2017, our projected total cash dividends will increase to approximately $575 million, a 17% increase over the prior year. We continue to believe that growth in our AFFO will be the primary ingredient for steadily growing cash dividend.","Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 11. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $386 million, including recurring CapEx of $36 million, above our guidance expectations largely due to timing of payments to our contractors, as well as an acceleration of spend in the EMEA region. During the quarter, we opened three new IBXs; S\u00e3o Paulo III, adding much needed capacity to this important Brazilian market; Dubai II, a smaller build in support of a critical cloud footprint; as well as Abu Dhabi I, our first data center in the new metro, as we expand our presence in the Middle East.","And given our strong pipeline, our firm yield, and the healthy returns, we continue to invest in new capacity with expected 2017 capital expenditures to range between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion for the year. And finally, please refer to slides 12 through to 15, as these slides bridge the 2017 guidance from our normalized 2016 performance.","So with that, let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Keith. Let me now cover our 2017 strategy on slide 16. To sustain our success and future proof our position, our strategic priorities are centered on pressing our competitive advantage to drive growth, and at the same time investing to catch the next way wave of market opportunity. We're pressing our positional advantage by capturing the cloud-enabled enterprise and extending our global footprint.","Our initiatives will remain focused on building cloud density, creating and deploying innovative product solutions, and enabling the adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud. We'll continue to build out our position as a marketplace, hosting the on and off ramps to clouds and networks. We also continue to expand our market leadership globally through acquisitions. In 2017, we will focus our energy on successfully completing the integrations of Telecity and Bit-isle, and then shift our focus to Verizon mid-year.","We will create future value through both organic and inorganic investments, and remain \u2013 and we'll remain disciplined in evaluating the strategic game board with a focus on emerging markets.","Over the longer term, we are working to develop the next generation of interconnection and cultivating our existing ecosystems, while continuing to develop new ones by harnessing the technology disruption going on in the market. We are proactively conducting market-sensing activities with our business development resources in areas such as the evolving public cloud architecture, wireless and IoT edge computing, subsea cables, next generation security and storage and electronic payments.","With over 6,000 Equinix employees, we continue to scale our organization and people. We are building a high performance culture paired with operational excellence and I continue to be very optimistic about our future.","Turning to 2017, we expect another year of solid revenue growth, improving margins and strong flow through to AFFO and our guidance is summarized on slide 17. The growth, scale and the structure of our business are driving increased AFFO and ultimately cash flow and dividends. And we are well positioned for both a great 2017 and 2018 and beyond.","So, in closing, we are pleased with our performance and remain confident that we can extend and leverage our market leadership to build large scale digital ecosystems that deliver compelling value to customers and exceptional returns to investors. We look forward to a busy 2017, as we integrate our acquisitions, grow our global platform, enhance our portfolio of services and increase our reach and relevance to the cloud-enabled enterprise. Our market leadership is driving strong financial performance and allowing us to invest in the business to capture emerging market opportunities and enable the innovation and adaptability to future proof this company.","So let me stop here and we'll open it up for questions. I'll turn it over to you Kerry.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. So, I was interested in where things stand with respect to the Verizon deal approval and what are the major factors affecting the timing? Secondly, on EMEA for Keith I suppose, I was wondering about the Telecity cross-connect count and are you finished taking inventory or is that reported number likely to grow as a result of finishing the IT integration of more of the Telecity markets? Then, I've got a follow-up. Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Jonathan, I'll start. This is Steve. I'll start with the Verizon activity. So, we're on a very good pace collecting the information through the final due diligence. As Keith mentioned in his script, we're still aimed at closing mid-year and we still intend to go to the market to raise equity and debt and all the collection of the information we need on the financials is on track. So, we're exactly where we thought we'd be at this point.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","And Jonathan, let me just double back then on the second question. As it relates to the EMEA cross-connects, certainly as I said, we brought four of the larger entities into our systems, our platform, if you will, so there's a number of other entities or legal entities that we will be bringing in over time. I would tell you that this is a base we think that has the potential certainly to go up to the right. But we'll continue to update you as we layer in more entities into our platform. An example of that is France is not yet included and as you start to move across Europe, some of the small emerging markets are not included either. So we'll give you a further update as the quarters proceed.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then \u2013 and I was interested in this new logo capture, you mentioned a lot of interesting successes recently. And are there any trends that you're seeing in the legacy business or perhaps as a result of pulling in Telecity, Bit-isle or prospectively Verizon that would lead you to think the rate of growth in new logos would change at all during the coming year?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yes, Jonathan, this is Charles. I think we continue to see across the board really good strength in cloud and in enterprise, as we said in the script that that was about two-thirds of our new logo captures coming from those two segments. And I think that really represents with the state of the market in terms of hybrid cloud, multi-cloud really being embraced as sort of the architecture of choice. And I think what we're seeing is that certainly with Telecity, we have gotten a pretty significant uptick in customers, we're cross selling those to the broader global platform, and you really continue to see good strength in enterprise across all three operating regions. In fact, as we noted, we had record enterprise bookings. So, we expect that momentum to continue very \u2013 the hybrid cloud trend is very, very, strong and pronounced and we feel good about that. And then \u2013 and cloud is also continuing to be good and (32:57) we see that not only in terms of the revenue growth that's coming from cloud service providers, but also new logo capture in that area, which we're really pleased with.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Jonathan, the only thing I'd add on the new logos, we are seeing \u2013 the channel is definitely a feeder for us for new logo acquisition with that 15% of bookings coming from channel. It's generating new logos for us around the world and we expect that to continue also.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is now open.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the margins and are you seeing just the need to incrementally invest in some of these sales areas or in overhead as you continue to expand the company and is there a portion of this investment that might be one-time to 2017, beyond the integration expenses and the things that you flagged as sort of highly unusual for transactional purposes.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yes. Michael, so the \u2013 as it relates to the margins themselves, certainly there is a number of sort of things that are taking place in fiscal-year 2017. As we alluded to, so there is some modest margin improvement this year, but there is a number of investments we're making, some of it in growth initiatives and that's really about continuing to augment our sales force and that's an area of continued focus for us. Now the second area as I said, there are some anomalistic cost increases related to our European market, that's going to impact us by roughly $16 million this year.","The other thing that is certainly worthy of note is, the level of expansion drag in the business has continued to scale. We had more construction projects and openings in late 2016 and into 2017 than we've had before and so that's another area that we'll continue to enjoy the benefits from as we rollout that inventory and start selling against it.","And then the last piece is that, as I referred to the LinkedIn churn happened from day one in the quarter effectively and so there is always \u2013 there is a drag associated with that. And until we take that inventory, we said we have great line of sight into some great eco-enhancing opportunities \u2013 ecosystem-enhancing opportunities, but until we backfill that relatively significant churn event, it has a net drag effect in the business, so you could call it one-off or one-time. As we alluded to, it's a $6.8 million impact to the first quarter on a revenue basis alone and so as you can appreciate, because we haven't backfilled that yet, you're having a net impact against the margin profile.","So those are the four key areas that I want you to walk away with. I think the most important thing that I would tell you is, as you think about Q1, obviously there is a lot happening in Q1. Number one, what's happening with currency, we've sort of earmarked that in our bridges. The second piece is the LinkedIn churn, as I referred to, again is relatively one-off and I think you'll see churn abate through the latter part of the year, but the other part is that we have costs that are incurred in Q1. There is $18 million of costs as we said that are very seasonal in orientation and when you actually take those costs, you infuse it in Q1 and then you think about what's going to happen for the rest of the year, by and large you're going to see SG&A relatively remain flat through all the remaining quarters and what that will tell you is, as our revenues continue to scale and we think that the net revenue contribution will go up quarter-over-quarter on a net setup basis, the margin profile and the EBITDA impact will be quite substantial as we go through Q2 through Q4.","So again, there's some anomalies that are taking place in Q1, but we're very confident that we are in a very good position given our record booking position of Q4 that 2017 is going to be a great year for us and it'll be a nice entering into 2018 once we load in the Verizon acquisition.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Probably, Keith was just commenting on the sales force, Mike. The sales force expansion is probably in the order of magnitude \u2013 it's in the order of magnitude of 10% roughly the quota bearing head increase we're going to do this year, so we'll go from roughly 370 quota bearing heads somewhere into the 415 to 420 head count. So that \u2013 of that \u2013 one of the four things Keith talked about is that order of magnitude for the sales engine.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And just one other question, on slide 26 of the deck, you layout the same store organic performance. In particular, you focused on the stabilized assets as one category, and you show year-over-year collocation growing around 2%, interconnection growing around 15%. I was wondering if you could share just how much of that is price versus volume for those two categories?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","I don't know that I have that in front of us, Mike, but I would tell you that I think it's probably more driven by volume. I think that we continue to see unit adds into our stabilized assets as people continue to find additional interconnection and opportunities that they're going to get a lot of value out of. Pricing has been stable, and I think that we do have price increases that roll through across people's service portfolio both on space, power and interconnection. But I would expect that it is more driven by unit volume. And then we do of course have power is also a part of the increases in power utilization in those facilities, also add to that.","So we continue to guide you in the 4% to 7% range, it sort of moves around a little bit based on timing of installs or churn that happened in those, but again, really strong performance, particularly in the interconnection line on the stabilized assets.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Schildkraut of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Guggenheim Securities","Great. I'd like to dive maybe a little bit more on what's happening strategically, in light of the record bookings and the record bookings under the enterprise group. I was wondering if you might give us a little bit of color as to what's pulling those enterprises in, particularly as you talk about adding more SaaS to the cloud exchange that is, is it infrastructure, is that still the big drawer, or are you seeing more enterprises come into the data center in pursuit of some of the SAS platforms that you're setting up? And then sort of as a corollary, you mentioned that enterprise is very strong in Asia-Pac, and I'm just wondering if there is anything going on in that region in terms of cloud adoption that might be sort of instructive and helpful in terms of thinking about adoption in other regions of the world? Thanks.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Hey, Jonathan, it's Charles. I'll take first crack at it here and these guys can jump in as desired, but I think that we're really seeing this whole interconnection-oriented architecture and the thinking around that really resonate with the enterprise customer. There is a number of used cases that I think are leading the way, when we talked about in the past is WAN optimization, people simply being able to find a better way to skin the cat in terms of their wide area network in terms of both cost and performance by using our network dens facilities.","And then, really the hybrid-cloud, multi-cloud value proposition in terms of that as the architecture of choice, and that may often start as simply a cabinet or two in a number of locations to gain high bandwidth secure access to public cloud, but then over time it tends to evolve to where they place private infrastructure immediately adjacent to that to begin to implement the private area \u2013 the hybrid cloud value proposition. And then, they begin to use cloud exchange to essentially take in new clouds to really take the multi-cloud element as well.","So, we definitely see people, the number of clouds on average that they're consuming is increasing, and there is a strong evidence that we see in our bookings that are demonstrating that, and we see our \u2013 the analysts saying that they think that's going to continue to increase based on what they're seeing \u2013 hearing and seeing from CIOs. In terms of the geographic mix, honestly we're seeing pretty good strength of that across all of our geos and cloud adoption does vary a little bit. I would say in Asia, for example, you mentioned we are seeing it strong there. Australia is a bit of an outlier to the upside there. They tend to be a bit more innovative and out-front, and so we're seeing really good success there.","Bit-isle has actually allowed us a lot more momentum in the enterprise segment in Japan and more feet on the street to call on them. So, all-in-all really just a strong reinforcement of the strategy around building the cloud-enabled ecosystem, capturing key strategic control points on the supply side and translating them into really strong momentum on the demand side with enterprise.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Guggenheim Securities","All right.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Yes. I think that's absolutely right. I'd add one or two things to that, Jonathan, just I think as we've talked about in the past there is \u2013 a lot of companies we're talking to are re-architecting their IT from a centralized set up to a distributed setup and that's drawing them to Equinix because of our global platform, and so as they bring their apps and their data and their clouds and their network connections closer to users, we look very attractive to them. And now, we're even being pulled into more security and data analytics conversations, which again are crossing many, many locations closer to their users. So, I think the combination of what Charles said and some of the broader strategic implications of becoming more and more decentralized is playing into our hands.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Guggenheim Securities","Great. Thanks for taking for the question, guys.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much. I was wondering if we could unpack some of the moving pieces with respect to your guidance here. I noticed the commentary obviously in the bridge, the law of large numbers in the LinkedIn churn, but clearly when we think about Telecity and Bit-isle as contributors, when do you think they can get back to sort of core Equinix growth levels. And I'm trying to understand sort of the outlook right now as it relates to the bookings commentary that you mentioned in each of those regions and clearly there's strong activity in both of those regions, you now have an expanded footprint in both of those regions. And just trying to understand what kind of impact that's having in your near-term growth?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yes, Amir. Look it's a great question that you're asking. Certainly something we spent some energy thinking about. First and foremost, you have to appreciate that we sell against a platform. And now that you've got Bit-isle and Telecity fully integrated into our business, it's going to highest and best use of our assets. So, we're indifferent to where we actually put the inventory, is this going to be the right customer, right application, right data center, if you will.","Having said that though, I think one of things that I think is important, let's use Bit-isle as the example. We said that for all intents and purposes, they'd remain relatively flat for a period of time because they're going through some elevated churn associated with some decisions they made prior to our acquisition. And so we are very comfortable at the low rate of growth that they're going to have knowing over time as we fill up, if you will, the Equinix organic IBXs, we would then sell into their platform.","And so from our perspective, we don't have a lot of high, if you will, high expectations for Bit-isle on what they're going to \u2013 how they're going to get to our level of growth. What we know is we're going to again make sure it's highest and best use of our assets in the Japan market. But I'd be remissive if I didn't say though, when I look at whether it's Telecity or Bit-isle, the relative performance of those assets in our platform and our ability to go after not only the cost synergies, the potential for the revenue synergies, the abilities to defer CapEx, the tax line, and just overall the expansion of the platform, it's allowed us \u2013 it's put us in a position to be more accretive than we originally anticipated and a higher AFFO than we \u2013 that we originally thought we'd get to.","Now, let me just flip to Telecity. Telecity in and of itself, again is roughly 78% utilized. We have to recognize that again it's a number of assets over many different markets, and so we're going to continue to focus on putting the right sort of customer application into the right data center. And so, to say that we don't worry about whether or not they get up to, if you will, our level of growth, what we're more worried about is highest and best use of the assets to drive as much shareholder value into that acquisition decision. And so that's how I'd like to leave it.","Again I recognize, we sell a platform, a platform in and of itself is greater than 11% growth. And as I said, we're going to do more bookings this year than we did in 2016, and absent unfortunately the LinkedIn churn, we'd do more incremental revenue in 2017 and 2016 as well. And so it tells you that the platform is showing more momentum than we've seen ever in our past.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. I'd just add a little bit too in that I think that we are \u2013 one of things we've talked about is that we're ahead of our \u2013 what we saw as our cross-selling synergy targets. Again, that distinction is going to become less clear as we integrate and sell the global platform. But what I would say is that we feel a high level of confidence that our comfort level and knowledge and confidence around the assets in both directions in terms of people that were Equinix sellers now seeing comfortable selling the Telecity assets and vice versa, we're really have an increased level of confidence that that is occurring out there and starting to really figure out what the best location, best asset for particular customer workloads are. And so I think what we're reflecting in terms of our go-forward view is what we think is going to happen, and we think they're going to \u2013 but we're going to continue to gain confidence I think in selling that and continue to see strong overall performance from the platform.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's very helpful. And then if I can ask a follow-up question. Should we think about the strategy with the Verizon assets in a similar manner? I mean the numbers that you have provided, it's accretive in terms of the margin structure of those assets and as you look to utilize or fully utilize those assets, when it comes to a platform, is it sort of a similar thought process when it comes to monetizing that?","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Yes. And probably I think again a couple of things to note. Largely, the Verizon assets are in overlap markets, meaning many \u2013 there is only a couple of markets that are net new markets to us. But the \u2013 and so, I think what they allow for is additional capacity and additional assets that allow us to position in our growth markets where we already have sale force on the ground delivering. And that's a little bit different than Telecity to some degree, but I think a good reason that we would expect we'll get good momentum. And then a couple of specific big adders, which is really gaining strength with NAP of the Americas as a critical interconnection asset and as a gateway to Latin America, and we candidly, based on initial customer response, believe there is some pent-up demand there and people seeing our ability and willingness to continue to invest in that asset in Equinix hands, and we think that's going to serve us very well. And then the government opportunity that it represented in Culpeper, which I think will open up a significant incremental addressable market for us.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much for the incremental color.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Your line is now open.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to ask a question about any of one percentage dilution from the law of large numbers in your 2017 revenue guidance. And I want to maybe see if you could put that in context with kind of what you talked about at your Investor Day in terms of your growth momentum through 2020. I mean it seems like, if you look at the same store revenue growth driven by interconnections that seems to be keeping pace, your CapEx is up year-over-year. So, a lot of kind of the drivers seem to be scaling. And so, how do I think about kind of that dilution from the large numbers?","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Well, Paul, if you can appreciate, we're dealing with a larger base. And certainly as I said, we're selling more, we're booking more, we have more incremental revenues. As I said, albeit it's identified separately on the bridge for you, the LinkedIn churn happened at the beginning of the quarters, $6.8 million impact to Q1 and $27 million impact to the year. All else being equal, clearly we're going to look to backfill it.","I'm sorry, the other part is recognizing that when you think about the business in and of itself, the transition from the acquisitions of Bit-isle and Telecity into the base, obviously that had an impact. I said, this year we did organically \u2013 roughly 14.3% organic growth, when you actually look at Telecity and Bit-isle, you say you got to take that out and you look at, well I'm not going from 14% and really going from 13% to a number. But the law of large numbers also includes that in its base. And so, when you get to the scale that we're getting to and you have slower growing assets that get infused into the base, we'd be remiss if we didn't actually say, look just because of our scale, this is what's happened to the number. But I'd just go back to what's most important. Are we selling more?","The answer is yes. Are we booking more? The answer is yes. Are we better positioned than we've ever been? The answer is yes and you couple that with, I think, our position, not only from a revenue perspective, but where we think we can take our costs over a period of time and how we can scale more cash into the business. Bottom line, I'm very comfortable with what we said at the Analyst Day and where we are on that journey, recognizing that \u2013 if you will, recognizing, I said, revenues will be greater over \u2013 on a compounded basis greater than 10% over that period.","This year, we're saying it's greater than 11%. So, it is going to be greater than 11% all else being equal based on where we're sitting today. And so, we have confidence that we can continue to scale the business at the targets that we had set for the Analyst Day. And I think that puts us in a very good position by the time we get to 2020, particularly when you're throw on the Verizon acquisition and then you hear about some of the opportunities that Charles referred to where we think we can scale it at maybe a greater clip than what they were doing onto themselves.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. So, from a like \u2013 if you look at your same-store metrics that came up earlier in the call, is there any reason to think kind of where you ended the year, isn't \u2013 I know, you provide guidance to it, but a decent kind of run rate for 2017?","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","What \u2013 I just want to make sure, Paul, you're referring to what specifically? Are you talking about the...?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Stabilized assets?","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","The 5.5% increase, the 5.2% or the gross profit...?","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yes, the slide 26. For example, 12% with expansions or 5% without it.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","As you know, these numbers are going to change quite dramatically by the time we get to Q1, because the number of assets that are going to stabilize and expansion is going to change a little bit. But if you just go back, you peel it all back. There is no reason to indicate why our stabilized assets can't continue to enjoy growth of, as we said, 4% to 7%. On a currency-adjusted basis, this quarter at 5% looks more like 6%. But that said, we understand that colocation tends to be slower growing, but it's the other services that we sell that augment the value of that 87% utilized inventory base.","And so from our perspective, we think we can continue to fill up those stabilized assets. Of course, it will be at a different clip than the expansion assets or the new assets. But overall, when you look at across our portfolio, that platform that we get to sell into is second to none and again, we're always going to focus on putting that right application into the right data center, and if sometimes that means it goes into an expansion data versus \u2013 sorry, expansion data center versus a stabilized data center, then that we'll do that or vice versa.","Again, we're very confident about the insight that we have on the business, the insight that we have in our pipeline and what we think we need to do to drive continued success into that portfolio.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the interconnection. How material is the cloud exchange as a driver and just kind of generally in terms of \u2013 what you're seeing from cloud-to-cloud and enterprise-to-cloud kind of abstracting from the network component?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Well. Yeah, I think it's beginning to become material financially, but it's significantly material strategically, and I think over time, it's going to be a major driver of how people consume and architect around the hybrid-cloud multi-cloud architecture. So, we are seeing \u2013 in fact I've been out in the field quite a bit this quarter, and sitting with both enterprises and cloud service providers, both hyper-scalers and sort of non-hyper-scalers, if you will, who really see cloud exchange as a tremendous opportunity to grab the aggregated demand of enterprises on the other side of that exchange. And so, we're really gratified by seeing what's happening there, the rate of growth of both port count as well as virtual circuits coming on to the platform. And I think, if you look at the scale of that platform already in a relatively short period of time, in terms of ports and traffic growth et cetera, we feel really good about it and it is beginning to become a meaningful contributor, but is a major piece of the strategy.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Well, Paul, this is Steve, also if you recall in the prepared remarks, we talked about interconnection revenues growing 21% year-over-year. We take the combined 10 quarters, 11 quarters in a row of cross connects over 5,000 net, add that to the cloud exchange comments Charles just made, add that to the Internet exchange activity we have, it's a major driver for the type of workloads that we're pulling in to these data centers.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","Great. Thank you. Two questions. One, on the Verizon transaction, I know you keep on saying mid-2017, I assume that means early third quarter, and I guess to that point I know there is a lot of talk about an equity raise I know that you know investors are focusing on that, is it logical to assume that you'd want to time that closer to when that deal's about to close?","And then my second question, in your prepared remarks you mentioned the shift to the edge. And I'm just curious if you feel it like you have the right facilities in the right markets to take advantage of that shift or is that really a broadening of the strategy and it might take you to look at other potential acquisitions in the future? Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Do you want to start, Keith?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yes, Colby, I'll take the first one then I'll pass the other one to Steve and Charles. I think, as it relates to Verizon, again we're seeing midyear, again I don't have better color for you at this point in time of what that means. We're very working very hard to sort out all the conditions that we need to solve for. Suffice it to say, and as Steve alluded to, we're well on our way. There is nothing that causes us any concern. And so, whether you want to do a July 1 close or June 30 (57:22), it really doesn't matter to us from that perspective. I think what's most important for us, particularly in the financing area is getting the \u2013 it's a carve out, and because the carve out requires carve out financial statements, and this is a significant acquisition for us, the most important item or the gating item for us to getting to the financing markets is really getting those audited financial statements.","As soon as we get those audited financial statements, we'll consider the market conditions as it relates to the data or equity market, and we will execute. But we're not waiting for the close. We're highly confident we're going to close this transaction. And so, the next step really is focusing on when to finance and how to finance it. We have good idea on the how, it's really just about the when. And that when is highly dependent on these financials, and I would just \u2013 stay tuned to this one. Again, we're \u2013 this is one of our most important areas of focus for the finance organization this year. And we're moving fast to bring this to an end.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","And Colby, let me start on segments. Steve may have something to add here, but I would say that, when we talk about the shift to the edge, we primarily are talking about moving to the enterprise going from what was traditionally a more centralized glasshouse type architecture to something more distributed where they're having to push infrastructure out to essentially interconnect with both their customers, as well as their vendors, employees, et cetera. And for us, a one man's edge is no man's core kind of thing, but for us it's generally \u2013 we're able to meet most of those demands today with our primarily Tier-1 market edge.","Having said that, I think that we continue to look at selective expansion of that edge to continue to meet needs. We've talked about, for example, adding markets like in South Africa, a Seoul, et cetera to selectively increase the extent of that edge to meet demand. And I would say that's our near-term focus, and I think we feel very comfortable that we can capture and serve most of the needs of the enterprise in that regard, including by the way IoT aggregation, which we're seeing. Even though that's highly distributed, we're seeing our centers be a very effective sort of location for IoT edge aggregation, even though they're not all the way out towards the devices.","Over time, I think we'll continue to revisit that and to the extent architectures and customer needs demand further push out, we'll evaluate that in the context of what that means for our growth and go from there, but I would say right now, we feel reasonably comfortable that our existing Tier-1 edge and some modest expansion to that is getting us a good chunk of the demand that we're after.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","The only thing I'd add, Colby, this is Steve, is that, if you think about our top 10 customers, which we've been very transparent with you guys are the largest networks and the largest cloud providers in the world, average 40-plus IBXs around all three regions in the world, many of their deployments with us are considered edge network nodes, edge nodes, cache nodes and so we're very in tune with the largest cloud providers and the networks, and where the edge of the network is moving around the world, including what Charles has said as it heads in the next wave towards emerging markets, and we continue to stay very close to that.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","Great. Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I wonder if we could talk a little bit about the market environment and the overall competitive environment. I think, at your Analyst Day you were saying that you continue to grow \u2013 you expect to grow faster than the market. Do you have any comments about what the market trend is?","And perhaps, a little bit more color on what's going on with competition, we've talked a lot about Verizon selling their data center, Sentry is being selling their data centers, we've definitely seen more consolidation here and I guess, winnowing out of some of the telco providers in particular. So what's going on that front, who are you going up against in these major markets and how does that evolve?","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","Sure, Simon, this Steve. Why don't I start and then Charles, if you guys can add-in. From a market environment, we still tend to believe with all the triangulation of the market data we get from the industry analysts and other data points that still for our industry network neutral colocation are staring at high single-digit growth rates. And so when we put our operating plans together, we always try to build an operating plan that exceeds \u2013 that grows faster than the market growth rate.","So it varies by market, we collapse it all together and our growth rates are always intended to take market share. So our belief is, coming out of the gate with greater than 11%, we'll continue to take share on top of the fact that we're spending more capital than anybody else in our sector. And so we feel like we're going to continue down that journey that we have been for several years.","The competition on a global basis is very limited, it gets stronger as you get to the region and then it gets much stronger when you get to a country. And so our competition today varies depending on the requirement, if it's a global requirement, we're normally very, very well positioned. If it's a regional requirement, there is more competitors to step into a region like Asia, Americas or Europe. But if it gets to a country, there's even more competition for a requirement that's just in a single country. That's a high level way to think about it.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Stephen M. Smith - Equinix, Inc.","That standpoint but (1:03:06) specifically, Charles.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yes. I'm going to add a couple of things. I think when you talk about share gains, there's always a question of share of what. I think that's a really important question, because we tend to be pretty selective about what portion of the market we are targeting and what deals where we believe we have a unique value proposition, where we're going to win workloads and customers with strong and high customer lifetime values. And I think that right now, we are capturing share particularly in this sort of premium retail segment. I would also say that candidly I think we're seeing increasing level of separation between ourselves and what most would view as our competitive set in part, because I think competitors are sort of going by the way side, the carriers are largely sort of moving away from colocation as a primary offering.","And then, secondly, I would say a number of the competitors in what many would consider our direct competitive set are increasingly focused on the pursuit of wholesale footprints, which as you know, we're very selective about our pursuit of those. If there are strategic control points and we feel like we need to have them as part of the ecosystem, we'll go after them. But I actually think our competitive position is improving, because many of the folks that traditionally we brought into seem very focused on winning mega footprint from CSPs, which typically we see as very price competitive and not really particularly central part of the overall ecosystem story. So, we run into the occasional regional player, but I would say more frequently our key focus is on communicating our unique value proposition to the customer rather than winning a head-to-head battle in terms of competitive wins. And so, right now I think the competitive market is shaping up nicely for us.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Many thanks.","Operator","Thank you.

You may begin.","Katrina Rymill","Good afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that some of the statements that we'll be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 24, 2012, and Form 10-Q filed on July 27, 2012, and Form 8-K filed on September 13, 2012.","Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition, in light of Regulation Fair Disclosure, it's Equinix's policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it's done through an exclusive public disclosure.","In addition, we will provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provided a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and the list of reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix Investor Relations page at www.equinix.com. We would also like to remind you that we posted important information about Equinix on the Investor Relations page of our website. We encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information.","With us today are Steve Smith, Equinix's CEO and President; Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Meyers, President of the Americas. Following our prepared remarks, we will be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Thank you, Katrina. And good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Before we get into more specifics on the quarter, I would like to give a quick update on our operations after this week's severe weather on the East Coast.","First, I'd like to thank our site operations teams for their heroic efforts before, during and after the storm to support our customers. Secondly, as search, rescue and cleanup efforts continue, our thoughts are with the people of New York and New Jersey and other hard-hit areas, many of whom remain without power and may be facing the loss of family, friends, homes and possessions.","We are fortunate to report that, as of today, the storm has minimal impact on Equinix in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. In New York and New Jersey, we are currently running on a mix of utility and generator power. Although some sites experienced water leaks, there was no flooding inside our sites, as we have had -- and we have had access to all locations and still do today. We are monitoring the situation closely and are managing regular fuel deliveries to our generator-run facilities until utility power is restored. Throughout this difficult event, we have also been communicating regularly with our customers, as well as the external market.","So now turning to the quarter, I'm pleased to report that Equinix delivered another quarter of solid financial results. As shown on Slide 3, revenues were $488.7 million, up 7% quarter-over-quarter and 20% over the same quarter last year. Revenue was in line with guidance before excluding $8.8 million from the announced sale of 16 IBXs.","Adjusted EBITDA was $228.3 million for the quarter, up 5% quarter-over-quarter and up 22% over the same quarter last year and excludes $4.3 million of adjusted EBITDA from the divestiture. Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, we see continued strength in the business and solid underlying fundamentals, including deal size, mix and pricing. Industry trends, including cloud computing, electronic trading and the exponential growth of mobility, IP traffic and video drove strong performance in network and financial services, with key customer wins across all of our verticals.","Asia Pacific had a notably strong quarter, growing organically 28% year-over-year, as multinationals expanded our footprint in this high-growth region. We also saw strength in the platform bookings as customers leveraged our global platform to deploy highly distributed infrastructure. 60% of our revenue this quarter is from customers deployed across multiple regions, up from 58% last quarter. And revenues from those deployed in all 3 regions increased by 34% over last year.","Our growth is driven by our global interconnection platform, where businesses are connecting to their customers and partners inside the world's most networked data centers.","Now let me expand on our 2 strongest verticals for the quarter. Financial services had a record bookings quarter, driven in part by electronic trading deployments in key cities around the globe. Today, over 75 exchanges and trading platforms are part of this driving ecosystem. Wins this quarter include the New York Stock Exchange, who deployed a safety access node in our New York 5 data center; and MICEX RTS, the Russian Stock Exchange, in our London 4 data center. Largely due to strength in financial services, our Secaucus campus continues to experience strong fill rates, high utilization and healthy pre-assignments into our newly opened New York 5 facility.","The financial services ecosystem in Asia Pacific is also growing very quickly, with Q3 growth led by our team in Tokyo, along with strong growth also in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Sydney and Singapore. Our Tokyo 3 IBX is fast becoming the primary meeting place for electronic trading in Japan. As an example of this momentum of developing ecosystem, after winning 2 trading platforms in Tokyo last year, bookings year-to-date grew 121% year-over-year. And 24 new financial customers joined the Tokyo 3 trading hub to connect to these trading venues.","Current growth of financial services is driven by the firm's mitigating risk by accessing market data sources inside our IBXs to trade smarter. Our customers recognize the value gained by being adjacent to key customers and vendors and a wide choice of networks that connect them to end points around the globe. New market participants are also driving growth in this vertical, as new global regulations will require over-the-counter derivatives to move onto electronic trading platforms.","Now switching to network. This vertical performed very well as telcos expand global deployments to offer services to our growing customer base. We are also seeing growth in pairing traffic and cross-connects between mobile ecosystem members, who are deploying in our site to reduce latency and provide reliable access to popular content and services. Many of our new builds will increase network density internationally.","For example, approximately 15 networks have deployed in London 5 since it opened just 2 years ago. And several major networks are putting their main fiber routes directly into the London 4 and London 5 campus. We recently opened Amsterdam 3, one of our most advanced data centers, which uses the latest in sustainable technology. The IBXs is located in the Amsterdam Science Park, which is one of Europe's most network-dense campuses, providing Equinix customers access to hundreds of global networks, as well as the Amsterdam and Netherlands Internet Exchanges.","Turning to cloud. Software-as-a-Service continues to grow, with distributed SaaS deployments leveraging our network density to enhance application performance. And we are also seeing wins from Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service providers. Hybrid cloud enablement is a significant opportunity for Equinix and cross-connects between cloud providers and other segments, such as financial services. It showed that cloud will continue to drive for new applications inside of Equinix.","We remain focused on our ecosystem strategy, managing our customer mix and assessing new deals and customer renewals with regard to size, power density, target vertical and interconnection profile. This is delivering strong results in terms of revenue yield per cabinet and overall price stability. As a result of these efforts, churn is creating some revenue headwinds as we progress with our IBX optimization program in the Americas and implement multi-tiered architecture deployments with key customers. We believe that maintaining this level of operating discipline is critical to our long-term success and central to delivering healthy revenue growth, long-term margin expansion and returns on invested capital. We also recognize that these are volatile times from a macroeconomic perspective. And we will continue to closely monitor these trends across the regions as we enter into 2013.","Shifting to our global offering.  This quarter, we expanded our platform organically and through acquisitions in response to customer demand. We believe our disciplined acquisition strategy gives us a significant first-mover advantage in expanding to new markets to support ecosystem growth and enhance the value of our global services.","In July, we expanded the platform by acquiring ancotel and Asia Tone. ancotel, located in Frankfurt, added over 200 new networks and 6,000 cross-connects, increasing interconnection revenue from 4% to 7% of monthly recurring revenue in Europe. ancotel is now tethered back to our Frankfurt campus, bolstering network density for our customers in that market and enhancing the overall value of Platform Equinix.","Our second acquisition, Asia Tone, has strengthened our position in Mainland China and across Asia. In addition, this quarter, we opened a new data center in Shanghai, where we have already won several mobile and network customers. ancotel and Asia Tone performed on target, contributing $16.1 million of revenues to the quarter. And we are excited by our customers' positive response to these new sites.","We're also exploring opportunities to drive CapEx-efficient expansions of Platform Equinix into other growth markets. Last month, we announced a partnership with DCI, a prominent local data center operator in Indonesia, to build and operate a new data center in Jakarta. Indonesia has the world's fourth largest population and the largest economy in Southeast Asia, which is experiencing significant growth in data and network traffic. In addition, recent financial regulations in this market will require the on-shoring of financial data storage. This partnership will leverage the strength of our Singapore operations, using our brand, sales channel and operational expertise, combined with DCI's capital and local knowledge, to offer leading data center services in the Indonesian market.","Equinix also continues to explore expanding Platform Equinix into other key markets. As an example, we believe the Middle East is an underserved connection point between Europe and Asia and has the potential to develop into an attractive transit and cloud hub for that region.","As a reminder, on Slide 4, as we sharpen our focus on developing business ecosystems, we are prioritizing our investment in markets required by our customers to optimize application performance. As a result of this strategy, today we closed the sale of 16 of our U.S. IBXs to 365 Main for approximately $75 million. The divestiture of these assets will allow us to focus our capital and management's intention on accelerating ecosystems in our most productive markets.","And finally, as announced last month, we plan to pursue conversion to a real estate investment trust to enhance shareholder value and create opportunities for profitable strategic growth. As a REIT, we will continue to pursue our growth strategy and do not anticipate any meaningful impact on the delivery of services to our customers. This tax-efficient structure will deliver significant economic benefit and allow us to provide shareholders regular distributions from earnings. We have already formed a project management office to support this conversion effort and expect to file a request for a private letter ruling with the IRS by year end 2012. After receiving an IRS response, which we believe could take up to 12 months, we will provide further clarity on operating structure as a REIT, including the expected division of our assets between qualified REIT subsidiaries and taxable REIT subsidiaries. If successful in this conversion process, we plan to elect REIT status beginning January 1, 2015.","So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to review some of the financials for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor","Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone on the call. So I'm pleased to provide you with additional detail on the third quarter. With the exception of our consolidated financial results, the majority of our other key non-financial metrics exclude the impact of ALOG, ancotel and Asia Tone. Where appropriate, we'll put pro forma key results to reflect the impact of our discontinued operation, thereby allowing you to compare prior results to your prior Q3 guidance.","So starting with Slide 5 from our presentation posted today.  Mobile [ph] Q2 revenues for continuing operations were $488.7 million, a 7% quarter-over-quarter increase and up 20% over the same quarter last year. Our performance reflects a $1.4 million negative currency headwind when compared to the average rates used in Q2, although a $3.4 million benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates. These results exclude $8.8 million of revenue attributed to the 16 IBX assets held for sale. The result is better reflected as a single line item below our operating results as discontinued operations.","On an FX-neutral basis and normalized for our acquisitions and the divestiture, our Q3 revenues increased 4% for the prior quarter and up 19% over the same quarter last year. Pricing per cabinet equivalent remains firm across each of our regions.","Global cash gross profit for the quarter was $330.7 million, a 5% increase over the prior quarter and up 23% over the same quarter last year. Cash gross margins were 68%, a 1% decrease over the prior quarter, primarily due to seasonality of utility rates.","Global cash SG&A expenses were $102.4 million for the quarter, below our expectations due to slower-than-anticipated hiring and discretionary spend. Next quarter, we expect our cash SG&A expenses to increase, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits and the increase in our advertising and promotion and the increase in our professional fees related to both REIT and non-REIT related projects, including our global tax-funding initiatives.","Global adjusted EBITDA was $228.3 million for the quarter, a 5% increase over the prior quarter and a 22% increase over the same quarter last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%. On a normalized and constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 2% over the prior quarter and 19% over the same quarter last year.","Global net income was $28.8 million for the quarter, a 21% decrease compared to prior quarter, largely due to $12.2 million increases in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense attributed to all of the IBX expansions and openings, a $5.2 million debt extinguishment loss related to our Asia Pacific refinancing and a $2.9 million increase in acquisition costs.","Our fully diluted earnings per share was $0.58, including $0.01 per share attributed to discontinued operations.","Now let me turn to global MRR churn. Our MRR churn was 2.9% this quarter, a decrease over the prior quarter and reflects our ongoing IBX optimization efforts, situations where customers transition to a multi-tier architecture and selective macroeconomic conditions, including some unanticipated bankruptcies. We expect our MRR churn to remain at or near these levels for the next few quarters. But our Q4 and 2013 guidance fully contemplates this level of MRR churn. Although MRR churn faced some revenue headwinds, we believe the end result of our proactive efforts will allow us to deliver stronger operating results in the form of higher pricing per cabinet, better operating margins and better utilization of our IBX asset base, thereby enhancing our return on invested capital. Equally, we expect our MRR churn risk to decrease over time.","Looking forward at exchange rates, the U.S. dollar exchange rate used for Q4 and the 2013 guidance have been updated to $1.30 to the euro, $1.60 to the pound and SGD 1.23 to the U.S. dollar. Our updated global revenue breakdown by currency for the euro and pound is 14% and 8%, respectively. And the Singapore dollar represents 6% of our global revenues.","Now I'd like to spend a few moments outlining the additional details in REIT conversion costs, and I'll highlight any expected impact on 2013. So turning to Slide 6. As previously noted, we expect that tax affected recapture related to depreciation and amortization expenses to increase our U.S. cash tax liabilities by $340 million to $420 million, due ratably over 4 years.","Our current NOL balance will offset the 2012 portion of this recapture. Yet, given the sizable book and tax gain attributed to the sale of our 16 IBXs and the higher taxable income related to our operating performance partly due to the change in our tax depreciation, we expect to fully utilize our remaining NOL balances by the end of 2012, leaving us with that expected cash tax liability of approximately $45 million for 2012. Looking forward to 2013, we estimate our cash tax liability to range between $200 million and $300 million, largely due to our decision to convert to a REIT.","We also expect to issue special distribution to our shareholders of undistributed accumulated earnings and profits, also known as the E&P purge. The E&P distributions will approximate $700 million to $1.1 billion to be paid out in a combination of up to 20% in cash and 80% in Equinix common stock. The E&P distributions are expected to be paid over a period of time, pending a favorable response from the IRS on our private letter ruling but before the end of 2015.","Also, we expect to incur approximately $50 million to $80 million in costs to support the REIT conversion process over the next 2 years, which includes operating our global financial systems and processes to reflect the conversion to a REIT. For 2012, we expect to incur $4 million of REIT-related costs. For 2013, we estimate we'll incur $20 million in incremental SG&A cost and $5 million of additional capital expenditures for the REIT conversion process. These costs are reflected in our 2013 guidance. If the conversion is ultimately successful, we expect to incur an additional annual compliance cost of approximately $5 million to $10 million starting in 2015.","Turning to Slide 7. I'd like to start reviewing our regional results. So let's begin with the Americas. Americas revenues were $293.9 million, a 2% increase over the prior quarter and up 13% over the same quarter last year. Our revenue increase absorbs a larger-than-expected revenue backlog and the IBX optimization effort currently under way in the region. Cap gross margins decreased slightly to 71%, primarily due to higher seasonal utility rates and higher operating costs related to the IBX openings. The Americas region continues to see strength in its platform booking, exporting deals to both Asia and Europe.","Adjusted EBITDA was $141.4 million, flat quarter-over-quarter and up 15% over the same quarter last year. Americas adjusted EBITDA margin was 48% for the quarter. As a reminder, the Americas region absorbs the majority of our corporate overhead cost, including our business system initiatives. Despite one of our strongest gross booking quarters, the Americas net billing cabinets decreased by approximately 200 at quarter end, reflecting the timing of our booking activity load for the quarter, the impact of an increasing cabinet billing backlog and cabinet churn occurring at the end of the quarter. The Americas region pricing per cabinet remains strong and reflects the impact of our ongoing strategy. Americas interconnection revenue continues to represent approximately 20% of the region's recurring revenues. In Q3, we added almost 1,500 cross-connects.","Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 8. EMEA had a solid quarter against a negative economic backdrop across most of Europe. Revenues were $112 million, up 9% sequentially and 5% on a normalized and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $46.5 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 42%, primarily driven by increased operating costs related to our IBX openings and expansions and lower margin attributed to the ancotel acquisition.","Normalized and on a constant currency basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 1% over the prior quarter and up 31% compared to the same quarter last year. EMEA interconnection revenues increased to 7% in the quarter, largely due to the acquisition of ancotel. Also, the region organically added 900 cross-connects in the quarter. Our EMEA region's net cabinets billing increased by 100 at the end of the quarter, largely due to timing of bookings and churn cabinet at the end of the quarter.","And now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to Slide 9. Asia Pacific had strong sales momentum with record bookings this quarter, driven by wins across our cloud, digital media and content and financial verticals. Asia Pacific revenues were $82.9 million, up 25% sequentially and 9% on a normalized and constant currency basis. Overall pricing remains firm across our entire Asia Pacific footprint.","Adjusted EBITDA was $40.4 million, up 29% quarter-over-quarter or 9% on a normalized and constant currency basis. We added 61 new regional customers this quarter, a 31% increase over a rolling 4-quarter average. Billing cabinets increased by almost 800 over the prior quarter. Interconnection revenues decreased 11% of the region's recurring revenues due to the acquisition of Asia Tone. Over the quarter, we organically added 800 cross-connects, another strong quarter of interconnection activity in the region.","And now looking at the balance sheet data, please refer to Slide 10. From a balance sheet perspective, at the end of Q3 and looking into Q4, we have a healthy liquidity position. Our quarter end unrestricted cash balance was $520 million, and we have full access to our $550 million line of credit. Our cash balance decreased in the quarter, primarily due to the net funding of $273 million for the acquisitions of ancotel and Asia Tone. Also, given the sale of our 16 IBXs today, our cash balance will increase by approximately $75 million.","Looking at the liability side of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with gross debt of $3 billion or net debt of $2.4 billion, about 2.7x our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. In the short term, we'll continue to review our balance sheet and debt structure to assess opportunity to refinance, with the objective of lowering our cost of borrowing while maintaining structural flexibility to operate as a REIT. We'll also consider the issuance of debt and equity to support projected REIT conversion-related cash requirements.","Now looking at Slide 11. Our Q3 operating cash flow decreased $102.2 million. However, on a pro forma basis, after adjusting for a $53.2 million GAAP charge indirectly caused by the REIT conversion, our operating cash flow would have been $156.6 million, a 20% decrease over the prior quarter and up 9% over the prior year. This decrease was largely due to the Q3 cash interest paid on our high-yield debt and the payment of acquisition-related costs.","Our adjusted discretionary free cash flow was $119 million in Q3, and we expect our 2012 adjusted discretionary free cash flow to range between $520 million and $540 million. Directionally, for 2013, we expect our adjusted discretionary free cash flow, excluding any REIT-related cash costs or taxes, to range between $600 million and $620 million.","Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to Slide 12. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $212.1 million, lower than expected and largely due to the timing of cash payments to our contractors. Ongoing capital expenditures were $37.6 million, which included $14 million related to maintenance, efficiency enhancement and single points of failure capital.","This quarter, we opened several flagship data centers in phases, including Amsterdam 3, Miami 3, New York 5 and Paris 4, providing sufficient inventory in our key markets to support the growth of the business and ecosystems. We'll continue to monitor our inventory capacity on adjusting time basis while carefully managing our existing customer mix and assessing future deals in terms of size, vertical focus and interconnection profile.","So with that, let me turn the call back to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Okay. Thanks, Keith. Now if we turn to Slide 14, I'd like to provide an update on 2012 and initial 2013 guidance. For the full year of 2012, we expect total revenues to range between $1.890 billion and $1.895 billion. This reflects a $36 million decrease in revenues due to the 16 U.S. IBXs held for sale, reported separately as discontinued operations, and includes a $10 million foreign currency benefit when compared to our prior FX guidance rates, but also absorbs $28 million of currency headwinds from our initial 2012 guidance.","Our refined 2012 revenue guidance incorporates the impact of a larger-than-expected bookings backlog and the revenue headwinds attributed to our MRR churn. Total year cash gross margins are expected to range between 68% and 69%, which reflects the cost related to the IBX openings in the second half of 2012.","Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between $410 million and $415 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to range between $880 million and $885 million as we continue to manage our discretionary and incremental spending programs. This reflects an $18 million decrease in adjusted EBITDA through the 16 IBXs held for sale and includes a $4.5 million foreign currency benefit, when compared to our prior FX guidance range. We're refining our total CapEx guidance for 2012 to range between $770 million and $790 million, which includes approximately $145 million of ongoing capital expenditures.","Shifting to 2013, we want to provide you with a directional view of our financial expectations. This takes into consideration the broader economic environment while using the FX exchange rates provided by Keith.","We expect 2013 revenues to be greater than $2.2 billion, an anticipated 16% increase over the midpoint of current year guidance, which effectively gives a revenue floor for 2013 at current exchange rates.","Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be greater than $1.010 billion, which includes $20 million in REIT-conversion costs as Keith outlined, effectively an adjusted EBITDA margin of 47% before REIT costs. We expect our 2013 capital expenditures to range between $550 million and $650 million, including about $165 million of ongoing capital expenditures.  Our expansion capital expenditures include approximately $115 million for expansion projects already announced in 2012.","Given these guidance expectations, we believe that our growing adjusted discretionary free cash flow should be sufficient to fund our growth capital expenditures and generate approximately $175 million of adjusted free cash flow, excluding REIT-related cash costs and tax liabilities. This is a significant inflection point for the company of generating a meaningful level of adjusted free cash flow, while funding our growth, as a result of the scale of the business and disciplined execution.","So in closing, as we approach the end of 2012, we are very pleased by yet another year of strong growth and business performance resulting from our focused strategy of global reach and ecosystems of high-value customers. Our disciplined execution of striking a balance between revenue growth, margin expansion and our targeted returns on our invested capital is driving us to make good long-term decisions for the business. With barely a visibility into 2013, we continue to see strong opportunity to build on our differentiated customer proposition and remain in a growth path towards our target of $3 billion in revenue for 2015.","At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. So I'll turn it back over to you, Jerry.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Chris Larsen, Piper Jaffray.","Christopher M. Larsen - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So I guess, first, I'll start with the wobbly news we're having here in the Northeast. Any sense, Keith, that you can give us in terms of early cost -- extra cost we might see going in the fourth quarter from having to run on diesel? Any SOAs that may have been tripped? Any other sort of things that we should think about from that? And are you having difficulties getting any of that diesel in? Because apparently, there's some fuel issues. And then, I guess, the second question I'll just ask you right upfront is, are you getting any sense from other people that, \"Hey, wow, we need to hurry up and get into an Equinix data center,\" because you are performing so well?","Keith D. Taylor","Chris, that's a great question. So what I'll do is I'll tag team this one with Charles. And so let me deal with the first question. Clearly, as we -- in this quarter, when you think about the amount of fuel that we're consuming, it's going to be much larger than we originally anticipated from our planning perspective, but that's contemplated within our guidance. Offsetting that, of course, is utility part. We won't be paying for the utility part while we're on generator. So from that perspective, it's probably going to be somewhat awash. Clearly, to the extent that we're running on full generation for a period of time, there are going to be some wearable components that we will have to replace. So we expect that we would have an increase in our R&M this quarter. That's sort of contemplated already in our guidance. So at the highest level, I feel comfortable that the guidance that we have in front of you today, absent something sort of catastrophic, we've fully contemplated the costs associated with any increases due to the storm.","Charles Meyers","And yes, Chris, I'll pick up on some of the other elements of your question. Relative to the fuel situation, obviously, that's something we're watching very closely. We have been able to access all the facilities and get timely fuel delivery thus far. And we're actively monitoring fuel supply, and we're tracking multiple sources of supplies, including access from outside the metro, if and when needed. So we're on top of that in ensuring that we have ready access to fuel to keep generator running as long as we need to until utility power is restored, which we believe could be several days still. So again, that is a key issue and one we are tracking very closely. Also, I think I want to reassure our customers that we remain on high alert, maintaining increased staffing levels as required to monitor and troubleshoot the facilities until return to a fully normal condition across the footprint. In terms of your last comment, I would say, again, we are watching it closely. And we'll continue to be very diligent until we are fully back to normal. But I think we are very pleased with how our facilities, and more importantly, our people, have performed. And we're going to continue to use this incident as a way to learn and get better. But I will say that we have had some challenges in older multi-tenant facilities in Manhattan, where we do not fully control, manage and maintain the building infrastructure. But in our Equinix campus facilities, where we have our main control and have our own processes for maintenance, et cetera, we have performed very well. And so, I do think it's a testament to the Equinix track record of operational reliability. And we do expect that that will be something attractive for both customers and prospects alike, as we come at the back end of this.","Christopher M. Larsen - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And no triggers on the SLAs, I take it, then.","Charles Meyers","Yes. We are looking at that. I don't believe that will be anything material. And like I said, both from a cost perspective on the incremental operating costs as well as SLAs, we don't believe there'll be anything outside of the range of what we contemplated.","Christopher M. Larsen - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Terrific. And is it too early to imagine anyone coming in, knocking on your door, looking for a safe place to stay? I'm talking about new customers, sorry, just to be -- yes, new customers coming to you saying, \"Hey, why, you did so well. We need to get in here.\"","Charles Meyers","It is not only not too early, it has already begun to occur. So absolutely not. And like I said, I do think that I'm sure my operational teams would mock me knocking on wood as I speak, but we continue to perform very well. Very pleased with the level of resiliency and the people and the processes operating the facilities. And people are -- I think, for example, the Secaucus facility continues to be a great option for people that is a fully maintained Equinix facility that, again, delivers superior results. So yes, it's definitely not too early. And my phone is ready to ring for anybody else who would like to come in.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Steve, I was wondering if you could offer some perspective, or maybe Charles as well, in terms of the difference in performance between yourselves, the interconnection-focused business and maybe some of the other businesses we see, whether it's large footprint retail or the wholesale names out there. You probably have a little bit more of a perspective, given that you do operate the DC 10 facility. In that regard, maybe you could also give us an update on how that facility is doing and if there are any plans to maybe take that to other markets. And then separately for Keith, I'm just wondering if there's a different way to think about D&A going forward, given that you've captured back a whole bunch of D&A, and you've extended the useful lives of your assets.","Stephen M. Smith","Yes. I'll start, Jonathan. This is Stephen. And we'll walk around that one. Because I think those are all good questions. But I guess the highest level, the way we think about it from a supply demand standpoint is that we operate on a different supply curve than the wholesale providers do. And so, if you -- let's just take our market as Charles has talked about, the Secaucus, the New York metro market, for example. So in our New York core asset, we're 90% plus built in that asset, which obviously triggered our decision for, just in time, New York 5 facility to come onboard. So the pipeline in New York 5, the fill rates are very strong, as you heard us voiced over in the script. So that's the market where you're probably hearing from the wholesale players that there's saturation in that market from a wholesale standpoint, not affecting us in terms of the ecosystem interconnected, electronic trading focus that we have in that market. So 2 different supply curves when you think about a market. And that obviously helps us, where we're focused on our type of customer deployment. I don't know if you would add there, Charles.","Charles Meyers","Well, yes, I mean, fundamentally, it is a very, very different business model. Very highly differentiated in terms of value we offer to customers for certain elements of their application architecture. And so, again, we target business where network density, application performance, global reach, mission-critical reliability are all critical factors in the decision-making for a customer. And interestingly, purchase decision for our customers is often a revenue-facing decision. And so, as a result, I think we've been able to sustain favorable pricing in the market that remains firm. I think our fill rates remain strong. We do see a movement towards these multi-tiered architectures where people are tiering their architectures to take full value -- advantage of the full value of Platform Equinix in terms of these -- some of these performance-sensitive applications, but then looking to incorporate larger footprint to handle perhaps less performance-sensitive or less latency-sensitive applications. In many cases, our customers would prefer to do business with us across that range, which is one of the reasons why we opened the DC 10 asset. That has performed very well for us thus far. We see a very strong pipeline there. And we are actively evaluating the extension of that product to other markets, so that we can meet at least selectively for strategic customers a more robust multi-tiered architecture requirement. In some cases, they need to go to even larger facilities. They do so in a very aggressive wholesale market today in terms of price competition out there for that. And they can often get great values for those larger footprint deals. But we tend to operate at the lower end in a very differentiated set of their applications.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","If I can just ask a follow-up question to that, you guys are also a purchaser of wholesale space. And as you start to walk down the path to REIT conversion, your ability to secure your assets over long periods of time, obviously, it would be pretty compelling to the investor base. Are you trying to take advantage of the current marketplace? And is there any update on your ability or your recent kind of renewals of some of the wholesale space that you occupy?","Chris Sharp","Well, I mean, I think there's a couple of things. Obviously, in every deal that we look at in terms of extending our footprint, we're going to look at the opportunities in front of us. And we've signaled before on calls and said explicitly that ownership of assets is something we're interested in, where that makes sense. And so we will look at that. And if opportunity presents itself for us to get a good deal on an asset, we certainly will do that. And if we need to lease space under very stable, very long-term favorable conditions, we certainly will do that as well. And there are deals out there for us to extend our footprint to meet fill rates or meet demand. And we'll look at that as we always do. But perhaps Keith can comment a little bit more on the ownership situation as well.","Keith D. Taylor","And Jonathan, what I would say is, generally speaking, when we think about leasing facilities, part of it is based on, as Charles said, where we want to extend our footprints. We're really sort of still a little down. It really is just another form of financing to us. So we have to look at sort of the implied cost of borrowing under a leasing scenario versus basically a do-it-yourself scenario. And we just take that into consideration. And as you know, our ability to borrow debt today, if we so choose, is at a relatively low rate, and certainly if the tax effect is even more. And so from that perspective, we take that into consideration. But it's exactly what Charles said, to the extent that we have the opportunity to own some of our assets, we'll -- and then makes sense for us, we'll certainly do that. To the extent that it's generally  a multi-tenanted facility, that's not something, of course, that we're going to own. It's going to be owned typically by real estate concern [ph].","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes. I was thinking more along the lines of, you're already in an asset. The opportunity came up to maybe renew or extend the term at a favorable rate. But I absolutely understand what you're saying. In terms of the D&A, Keith, is there any way to think about this differently, given the extension of useful lives?","Keith D. Taylor","Yes. There's really not because -- the challenge that we have here, Jonathan, is when we talk about recapture -- what we're really talking about is tax recapture, which is very different than book. And so the recapture is effectively recapturing -- if you will, the IRS recapturing basically the depreciation that we took as a C-Corp and there -- and we re-characterize it as basically real estate -- that was real estate oriented, it could be amortized for tax purposes up to 40 years. And so effectively, that recapture through 2011, any adjustment to our taxable income for 2012, is really all about tax. It has nothing really to do with book. So -- but as a general comment, when we think about the economic life of our assets, I still maintain it's roughly 20 years or greater. And we've always had somewhere between 20 and 30 years as the economic life of many of our assets. And as long as we have strong maintenance or preventive and predictive maintenance programs, which we do, we should enjoy the full economic life of that asset. And so I think we're -- I think what we're going to get then is a little bit of a mix match between what the tax authorities look at versus what the U.S. GAAP sort of reporting is for our depreciation. And I think that was the -- that's the issue here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike McCormack, Nomura Securities.","Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just a quick one, Keith. You mentioned that there's some increased cabinet churn at the end of the quarter. Can you just sort of walk through -- and maybe Charles can help on this as well -- just walk through the process of optimization, sort of how far along we are, whether that was the cause of late-quarter churn on the U.S. cabinets? And then secondly, on EMEA, obviously, very strong interconnect from ancotel. Is there a read-through from that, which you can then sort of process that interconnect revenue and dive more penetration into that market as well?","Charles Meyers","Yes, let me -- Mike, let me tackle the first one in terms of the Americas cabinets and the activity there and how it interfaces with our -- the churn issue. So again, I think that the churn is really -- it's really primarily an artifact of us continuing to execute on our strategy in a very disciplined fashion. We talked over the last several quarters about this IBX optimization program. And we essentially -- where we -- we're looking at each location, identifying business that either is low priced, low power density, low interconnection, some combination of those things, and very explicitly evaluate if, when and how we would intend to replace that business with deals of higher commercial quality. And as we signaled, those efforts are driving the higher churn levels. But it's critical to note that virtually none of that churn is associated with the loss of what we consider targeted business to our competitors. So undoubtedly, it does recreate some revenue headwinds. And you see that in the net cabs billing number. That's exacerbated a bit by the timing of our bookings in the quarter, which tend to be a bit back-end loaded. And again, obviously, there's revenue headwinds because the churn -- the revenue disappears immediately and then takes a bit of time to backfill. But we see -- already see the program continuing to have significant positive impacts on our business. As I mentioned in our last call, some of the specific churn actions we've already taken will drive millions of dollars in incremental EBITDA with 0 capital investments. Our site margins are going up. MRR per cab is going up. The power utilization is going up. Cross-connect density is going up. And those are all metrics that are highly correlated with long-term operating margin in the customer retention. So I'm confident that our actions are not only expanding operating margins but reducing the overall capital intensity of business; increasing our cash flow performance, which is becoming evident; and really -- and materially improving our ROIC over time. So that is the dynamic that you see there in that metric. But the continuation of that program is fully contemplated in the 2013 guidance we provided. And we think that, over time, that offers upside as we fully align our businesses' mix with that strategy.","Stephen M. Smith","And Mike, this is Steve. On the interconnection question in Europe, one of the primary factors on the acquisition of ancotel was that that asset sat in one of the busiest nodes in Frankfurt and actually has the DE-CIX, which is probably the busiest DE-CIX node in Europe. But as we've mentioned several times, we picked up a couple of hundred new networks worldwide from about 63 or 64 countries, many of them to Eastern and Central European network players, over 6,000 physical cross-connects, as well as a -- basically a virtual Meet Me Room product that we're still understanding how we're going to leverage possibly elsewhere in the world but works very effectively in that part of the world. So that has definitely helped the interconnection focus in Europe and that was a prime driver for that acquisition. As I mentioned today, it took us from 4% of revenue to 7% of revenue for interconnection. That team had very healthy quarter on cross-connects with over 1,000. So we're -- yes, we are very focused on making that more interconnection dense in Europe. Eric is driving that business. Eric Schwartz is focused on doing that. So that -- and half of ancotel's business comes from cross-connects. Half the revenue is associated with cross-connect. So it's a very cross-connect dense product -- company. And it's now tethered into the Frankfurt campus. So we'll leverage in that as we grow the business.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Rollins of Citi.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more on the sales side broadly, what's happening with the growth of the sales force, the productivity of the sales force and where you're seeing the pipeline and backlog.  You made a couple of comments about some increases in backlog, I think. But I wasn't sure if that was coming into the third quarter or exiting the third quarter. And so if you can give us a little bit more color on those factors, that would be fantastic.","Stephen M. Smith","Sure, Mike, this is Steve. I'll start and I think Charles probably has some insight in Americas that might be helpful here. So big picture around the world, we are approaching as we come to the year end, call it a couple of hundred quota-bearing reps around Equinix in the 3 regions. As we have taken on these new headcount over the past 14, 16 months, we've obviously started to manage our underperformers. And we're getting them all aligned to our industry verticals. Heavy, heavy focus on networks, financial and cloud providers. All of them are selling Platform Equinix. So we are incenting the entire sales force to sell all -- now we've exited, 69. I think it's roughly 92, 93 IBXs around the world. So they're all incented to sell the entire platform. From a new rep productivity standpoint, it's still a very positive story. And internally here, we kind of talked about -- we're very optimistic about their sophomore year as they enter into their second-year of performance here. But the performance does vary from vertical to vertical. And we're probably strongest in the 3 I just mentioned: network, financial and cloud. That varies a little bit by region. But generally speaking, our value proposition is very strong in those 3. It's a little tougher to open an enterprise customer, whether it's a manufacturer or a retailer or an energy and oil and gas company. But generally speaking, new reps are really starting to continue to go up into the right from a performance standpoint. Overall, pipeline is good. Our coverage ratios are in line with our plan. And price realization, as you mentioned -- as we mentioned in the script today, our MRR per cabinet, particularly on new deal pricing, still remains firm. So generally speaking, we are very happy with the growth of the sales productivity. But I want to be clear that sales productivity just doesn't go away at any one time here. This is a top priority for this company. It will continue be a top priority. We'll continue to bring more heads down. We'll continue to get more productive. We're going to continue to get deeper in our verticals and talk about selling solutions to our customers. We're providing the collaboration tools so they can speak like one Equinix. And we're quite, frankly, bringing a lot of thought leadership to these industry vertical conversations as we get deeper into these relationships. So I like where we stand today in terms of total productivity of our sales engine. Charles, would you add anything?","Charles Meyers","Yes. And I think you hit most of the key points there. Just from a -- specifically, from the Americas perspective, again, we had our second largest regional bookings quarter ever in Q3, continuing to deliver strong exports in terms of global needs, platform booking needs that go out into the other regions. Records, actually, from a bookings perspective in both financial services and network. As Steve indicated, we're a little less mature in our value prop in some verticals and -- but productivity levels continue to be up and to the right. I talked a lot about this cohort analysis we do. And I did indicate there should be continued upside left for us in terms of bookings growth. So with regard to the backlog question, it's interesting because what's happening, we are seeing record levels of backlog. Although our book-to-bill interval continues to be generally across most of our implementation is very strong, we're seeing some extension of it because, particularly in our business suite offerings, it's simply a larger -- tends to be a larger footprint-type implementation, which takes a bit longer to ramp into. And then secondly, we've modified our approach to selling power. And that's really materially improved our power utilization. But it requires us to make a -- just offer ramp [ph] to customers because the take-or-pay nature of the pricing. And so those things have added a bit to the revenue backlog, which, again, provides a little bit of tailwind in the face of the revenue headwind that we talked about on the churn side. So a little bit of a countervailing force there. But again, overall, I think productivity continues to trend in the right direction. As Steve said, we are very focused on it, continuing to work on it every day, improving the quality of our value propositions in the other verticals. And it feels -- like I said, I feel good about what's Steve referenced there that are sophomore-year performance for the new reps.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Louthan, Raymond James.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just given some of the dislocation in the business recently, can you give us an update on what your current customer concentration is, large customers, the percentage of revenue and what sort of the larger -- your largest vertical? And what sort of utilization trends are you seeing across your different segments? Where would you expect your -- the overall utilization of your data centers to be 12 months from now?","Stephen M. Smith","A couple of questions there, Frank. Let me start off and maybe Keith and Charles can chime in here. Let me give you a color in the quarter where the bookings fell. And I'll just give you a worldwide numbers just to give you context. Our largest vertical in the quarter, as I mentioned in my script, 25% of our bookings were in network and 25% of our bookings fell into the financial services. So we had very, very strong growth in those 2 verticals. That was followed by -- 22% of our bookings fell into the cloud and IT, which is the third one that's really been high growth for us. 18% was in the content digital media companies and then 9% were in our enterprise, which is pretty consistent with where our revenue -- our monthly recurring revenue is by vertical. Pretty consistent in the network. We were up a little bit in the financial. Enterprise is 9% of revenue, and it was 9% of bookings this quarter. Content digital media pretty flat, cloud pretty flat. So we tend to fall into those 5 industry verticals in that form, pretty much every quarter. So I guess the takeaway there is network, financial and cloud continue to drive our bookings and obviously, feed our monthly recurring revenue numbers. Second part of your question, I don't...","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Utilization trends.","Stephen M. Smith","And utilization -- in terms of vertical, Frank, is that where you're coming -- were you coming from utilization of our assets?","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Utilization of the assets, just kind of -- in each one of the 3 areas.","Stephen M. Smith","Yes. Utilization has shifted a little bit this quarter, obviously, as you heard Keith talked about the amount of capacity that we've brought on this quarter. But utilization now is roughly 80% in the Americas. And it dropped down to 68% in Europe because of all the capacity we brought on in Paris and Frankfurt and London and Amsterdam. And we're around 71% in Asia. But worldwide, we're about 74% utilized. That's the current figures on build capacity.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","As you expected to be 12 months from now.","Stephen M. Smith","Well, it will obviously go up. You can see our CapEx guidance is down, and we've got capacity in critical markets and goals to increase bookings every -- year-on-year. So our expectation that we'll continue to raise the utilization levels to historical levels.","Charles Meyers","Yes. The only thing I would add, Frank, is if you think that -- we track utilization, both space and power utilization, at a very granular level. So you see the sort of big background number, which is heavily influenced by the addition of capacity into the system. But we track it at a much more granular level. And our optimization program are looking not only at cabinet utilization but at power utilization and our ability to continue to monetize power and drive higher levels of cabinet utilization through various techniques. And our optimization program is really a lever for us on margin expansion. So I expect not only are we going to just simply grow into the capacity that we put out there, but we're going to continue to drive very -- higher and higher levels of utilization on our existing assets. So I don't know the exact number that will trend to in the Americas over the next 12 months, but we're going to add some more capacity coming up here. But at a granular level, we are very focused on continuing to drive utilization, given the impact it has on ROIC.","Operator","Our next question is from David Barden, Bank of America.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If I could just -- Keith, just following up a little bit on the guidance, trying to do the math, subtracting the first 3 quarters of the adjusted EBITDA for the switching data reductions from the midpoint of the guidance. It seems to give us a number of around $2 million to $6 million, which is actually down sequentially. And then if I take that and multiply it by 4, then I look at your guidance and then see growth that's actually going to be closer to $10 million or $11 million sequentially, quarter-over-quarter. So if you could flip back for us, kind of help us understand the -- what's moving those numbers, would be great. And then, if I could, just a second question. Obviously, coming into this quarter, we heard a lot of noise about the challenges that Digital Realty and DuPont Fabros are having in the wholesale side of the market. And obviously, we're seeing that those 2 things -- those 2 businesses of yours, I know those are not really linked in terms of performance. But does their challenges in terms of supply versus demand present an opportunity for you guys to have lower cost inputs to your facilities next year?","Keith D. Taylor","Great questions, Dave, and I think we'll probably tag team this a little bit. But let me start just with -- let me start with 2012, sort of our -- where we're going to guide for the rest of the year and how that translates into the 2013. But I also sort of have to take you back to sort of 2011, just so you can get a sense of how we performed and how we're applying that offering guidance here. Though at the highest level, and as you're aware last year, when we came out with our guidance roughly at this time, we were -- we guided to -- that we do roughly 1.87 from a revenue perspective. If you actually take  -- if you pro forma everything, and there's a couple numbers that I think you have, but I just want to make sure that we knock this one down, that if you actually pro forma that -- your loss in asset of $36 million in revenue, between Asia Tone and ancotel, you're going to have roughly $34 million of revenue pickup this year. And if you look at the FX impact, from when we originally offered guidance to where we are today, there's a $28 million headwind. On an adjusted basis, you get to roughly a 19 23 number. Now the guidance that we offered at midpoint is 18 93. Again, that reflects the Apple transaction and the like. So said differently, when you think about where we offered guidance last year versus where we'll all be coming in, we had a lot of confidence that it was going to be a greater than and no different as I look into next year, being 2013, we're offering you a floor of $2.2 billion. And so unless you look at it from a number of different perspectives, I looked at Q4 exit rate this year and I look at Q4 exit rate last year, I annualize, and then I look at the certain net impact based on the numbers that we're actually showing greater acceleration this year than we did last year, number one. And that being a key takeaway. But number two, just off the pure floor, the base. We thought -- we grew, again, on an adjusted basis 2012 over 2011, we're growing at roughly $316 million of that pro forma number. Out of the gate, we're offering you a $307 million uplift. And so from my perspective, we looked at all of this. We then took that into consideration. We talked more a bit about the headwinds related to churn, the delay in the backlog. We felt that this was a good first-choice entree into the market at this point, given the macroeconomic environment. It's a 16% growth over a midpoint of guidance for 2012. And we think that was a good sort of first step in delivering guidance for 2013. And again, no different than we've done in the -- over the last couple of years. We're going to continue to update you on a quarter-over-quarter basis, as we get more clarity on how the year is going to perform. But certainly, we're all sitting here. We think it's a robust guidance. There's very few that are out there delivering 5 quarter ahead guidance. And our point of view is that this is a good guidance to come out of the gate after the Q3 call. A lot of the numbers.","Charles Meyers","And relative to the second question, in terms of -- I think your question is primarily oriented around -- given competitive intensity in the wholesales, does that gives us an opportunity to reduce our sort of factored cost -- unit cost going in. Again, I think we look at every deal. We have a very competent and very focused corporate real estate team that looks at -- as we give them our roadmap, if you will, of where and how we want to expand our platform, we go out and look at what is available to us and whether that is in the form of existing facilities that we would lease or other options. I think we evaluate those on a yield-by-yield basis and continue to get the best possible deals we can get. And so if that -- if that allows us an opportunity to reduce those costs, we will certainly capture it. And -- but I think your initial observation is spot on, which is these are very different businesses. And I think people are beginning to realize that.","Operator","Our final question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wonder if we could talk about 2013 CapEx for a minute. I think, if I got it right, there's $150 million announced CapEx, that -- which works at to a buffer of almost $300 million. It doesn't look like you announced any new projects in the last quarter or so. And you did talk about having plenty of capacity there. So how should we think about that $300 million? Is there -- are we going to get more clarity on that in the next sort of 3 to 6 months? Or is that really something you'll sort of take a look at early next year and see how demand is developing?","Keith D. Taylor","Great question, Simon. I think first and foremost, you're absolutely right when you think about amount of capacity that were brought on in Q3. And we'll bring on some more capacity in Q4. And we'll continue to manage that inventory, as we said, on a just-in-time basis. And we've got -- as Charles said, we have a very good focus today on -- and managing not only the physical space but also the infrastructure throughout the portfolio. That all said, as you're aware, there's some markets that, for all intents and purposes, were sold out [ph] when we haven't announced anything. An example of that could be like at Toronto; we're eager to get into the Toronto market. You know that we're eager to get into other markets that we've talked about around the globe. And then there's other assets at or near capacity where we're already starting to think about the next expansion phase or the next build. And so -- but with all of that, I think, as we go through each quarter, we'll give you clarity on how we're go to spend the money. But I don't think it's going to be a surprise to you that there's going to be markets that we really haven't announced any sizable bill as of late. And because of that, we're going to have to come back and put more capacity into the ground. And again, we're going to manage it very, very tightly and focus on a just-in-time basis and make sure we can phase or stretch out our capital as far as we can to hit as many markets as we can. As you know, today we're in 30 markets post the announcement today. And so we got to make sure that we have sufficient cap to meet all the needs. But I feel very comfortable. We've got a very disciplined process that not only identify the next opportunity but also manage the filling of that opportunity.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Was that fairly linear through the year? You obviously had a big back-end loading this year.","Keith D. Taylor","It's very episodic as you know. It tends not to be linear. You can see it in the lumpiness of our CapEx this year. And I'll tell you, going forward into 2013, I would expect it to be somewhat lumpy again, and it will just depend on the timing of when we turn up some of these construction projects and then how we settle the obligation to our contractors. Because our -- the CapEx numbers we delivered to you guys is really a cash number, right? We're taking into consideration the movement of funds to our contractors. But my sense is it will not be a linear chart next year.","Katrina Rymill","That concludes our Q3 call. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that some of the statements I'll be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2013.

Following our prepared remarks, we will be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report Equinix delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues were $519.5 million, up 3%  quarter-over-quarter and 17% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $243.5 million for the quarter, up 2% quarter-over-quarter and up 16% over the same quarter last year. Our MRR per cabinet remains firm, and we continue to experience positive sales momentum in bookings. Our vertical go-to-market strategy and continued IBX optimization efforts are allowing us to win and maintain the right mix of applications and balance healthy top line growth with outstanding margin performance.","Over the last year, we have taken a highly disciplined approach to evaluating new deals and customer renewals. And this proactive effort has resulted in solid pricing dynamics, better customer mix and significant CapEx efficiency but has also resulted in elevated churn. We believe we have reached a turning point in these efforts and expect churn to trend down as we move through the remainder of 2013.","This quarter, we saw accelerated growth in new customer wins, as well as healthy expansion from our existing customer base. We continue to see customers deploy across multiple IBXs and see very strong correlation of this trend with key metrics such as win\/loss, price per kilowatt and renewal rate. Whether it's across multiple metros, multiple countries or multiple regions, our ability to address our customers' footprint needs with our unique global platform continues to drive customer value and sets Equinix apart from the competition. Demand for our highly networked and distributed data center services is being driven by technology trends, including the explosion of video, emerging cloud-based IT services, the proliferation of mobility, growth in IP traffic, electronic trading, as well as e-commerce.","Each of our industry verticals performed well this quarter, with clear indication that customers are using Platform Equinix to support global expansion and to connect with partners and customers to accelerate their business performance. I'd like to provide you with a quick overview of the trends we're seeing across each vertical, including a deep dive into cloud, our highest growth segment this quarter. At the heart of our business are the networks. The company was founded by providing a neutral location where networks meet and trade traffic. 14 years later, this strategy is still paying off. This quarter, we saw double-digit revenue growth year-over-year across all 3 regions for the network vertical, with particular strength in Asia Pacific. Further, as IP traffic continues to grow, we see the beginning of a refresh cycle for subsea cable systems. Equinix's strength as a market leader and our ability to concentrate demand is a key priority for subsea cable operators looking to quickly monetize new projects. An important customer win this quarter was Seaborn Networks, which will establish its first Brazil gateway in Equinix's S\u00e3o Paulo 2 IBX. By offering direct connectivity to Seaborn's low latency route between S\u00e3o Paulo and New York, we can support the needs of our global customers in these 2 key markets, reaffirming the importance of our ALOG asset.","In wireless, we experienced more that 30% year-over-year growth, which includes 450 service providers and enablers in this developing ecosystem. Mobile network operators such as U.S. Cellular, MetroPCS and China Mobile are leveraging Equinix facilities to efficiently deliver applications and content to their users. With increased traffic across mobile networks supported by 4G and LTE, mobile backhaul continues to be a major benefit of locating within our IBXs. In addition to the operators, ecosystem players operating inside our IBXs include content and application providers, service enablers, cloud service nodes, advertising platforms and traditional voice and messaging services.","If I move now to the financial services, we see trading platforms and participants expanding globally as they seek to access new markets and provide enhanced services for clients. For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will deploy in London to provide the fastest access back to their Chicago services hub and to establish a [indiscernible] for their new European derivatives market alongside other key financial companies. Financial services continues to demonstrate an incredible ecosystem power, as financial to financial cross connects grew over -- more than 30% year-over-year, and we gained traction in new areas such as foreign exchange and over-the-counter trading.","In content and digital media industry vertical, we continue to see significant demand, as latency-sensitive, high-performance applications like video and online content continue to grow. In addition to serving the multi-tiered architecture needs of top content providers, we are attracting emerging technology players such as digital advertising exchanges. Last week, we announced a partnership with BrightRoll to enable the fastest real-time bidding in the video advertising marketplace. Similar to the dynamics in electronic trading, real-time bidders must analyze ad impression information from exchanges and submit bids within milliseconds. Reducing latency helps buyers by increasing their ability to successfully respond to more bid requests within the required time limit, which translates into better performance for advertisers and increased revenues for companies in this rapidly evolving ecosystem.","Moving to the enterprise industry vertical. Our vision for this market is to provide Platform Equinix-enabled solutions that help enterprises optimize and scale their data, their networks and applications around the world. Improved application performance and IT utility are necessary to achieve key business objectives, and progressive enterprises are rethinking how to deploy applications, innovate around their data and improve the connectedness of their business. Challenge to deliver more business solutions faster with less resource and at a lower cost is increasingly more difficult. Many enterprises are responding to these challenges by evolving to hybrid cloud architectures, often facilitated by the move from in-house into co-location facilities. By leveraging Platform Equinix, enterprise companies gain access to network density and to a host of cloud services that optimize performance and reliability. Key customers in this vertical are Walmart.com, L'Or\u00e9al, Sanofi-Aventis, with new wins coming from the Fortune 500 and from subsegments, including legal, oil and gas, retail and healthcare.","Finally, I'd like to highlight the drivers behind the acceleration of cloud-related demand across all of our verticals. Turning to Slide 4, our cloud vertical delivered record bookings this quarter and was a substantial driver of new logos. With over 1,100 cloud and IT service provider customers who deliver 24% of our revenue, Platform Equinix represents a significant advantage for CIOs looking to leverage the economies of the cloud without sacrificing security or performance. At the heart of our cloud ecosystem are both cloud service providers who naturally resonate with the Equinix value proposition and the buyers of cloud services or what we refer to as cloud-enabled enterprises. Cloud service providers are deploying at Equinix to achieve network reach, support mission-critical workloads and gain access to our more than 4,000 customers and their customers around the world. These providers are tapping into the global breadth and network density only available in Equinix data centers, allowing them to overcome the limitations of the Internet and offer services closer to end users to meet performance requirements.","Present in Equinix data centers are 4 types of cloud service providers. First, at the foundation are cloud compute and processing services provided by the Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers, such as Amazon Web Services, GoGrid, Rackspace and others that are deploying critical cloud nodes at Equinix to provide lower latency and improve security to their end customers while reducing their network cost. Second, Platform-as-a-Service providers such as Windows Azure and Zynga are leveraging Platform Equinix to build their computing platform and solution stack to simplify the delivery of these complex offerings to businesses through a direct connection. Third, the Software-as-a-Service market, which today is twice the size of the Infrastructure-as-a-Service market, is one of our largest opportunities with hundreds of customers that are evolving to deliver applications on a cloud platform. In the cloud segment, Software-as-a-Service wins are driving the majority of new logo count and bookings, and Equinix customers include Box, Salesforce.com, ServiceNow and Workday that are leveraging our network density and global platform to enhance application performance. And fourth, beyond these more established industry classifications, we are seeing traction among cloud service enablement companies like Citrix, NetApp, RightScale and others that offer complementary services and capabilities that help with the effective use of management of cloud deployments.","As we grow our base of these service providers and enablers, buyers of cloud services are drawn to this cloud ecosystem to interconnect and optimize their infrastructure by moving a portion of their data and applications to the cloud. Increasingly, customers like Autodesk, XO [ph], McGraw-Hill come to Equinix to realize the benefits of hybrid cloud deployments which allow for optimal efficiencies, security and control in managing their IT workloads.","Now let me shift to an update on our expansion activity. As demand across the verticals continues, we are investing and building out our global platform to meet customer needs. This quarter, we opened up our first IBX in Jakarta in partnership with a company called PT DCI. Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world and the fastest-growing economy in Southeast Asia. Equinix has the opportunity to provide high-quality data center services to support that growth. We are also making investments in Tokyo and Singapore to build out data centers in the heart of their financial districts. Singapore 3 is a significant build, with expansion potential of up to 5,000 cabinets. In the Americas, we are building a new data center in Rio de Janeiro to support a robust Brazilian economy and customer demand associated with the upcoming World Cup and Olympics in Brazil. We also expect to complete the critical phase 2 expansion of Silicon Valley-5 to support growth in a technology-focused Silicon Valley market. Additionally, we are already seeing strong early demand in our newest data centers in Seattle and Miami. In Europe, we will open our fifth IBX in Zurich, a standalone data center that is tethered back to our network-dense downtown location. We also plan to expand London 5, which has far exceeded our expectations with a fourth and final phase of this project. Our new expansions remain on time and on budget, but as a reminder, reported capital expenditures can vary depending on the time of actual payments. As always, we continue to expand with a disciplined approach as we evaluate new markets and opportunities.","And finally, sales productivity continues to be a top priority for us as we mature our go-to-market strategy. Our sales and marketing organizations around the globe are aligned by industry vertical in order to gain a much deeper understanding of our customers' requirements, which allows us to help them deploy the right applications in the right IBXs across the right markets, leveraging Platform Equinix to meet the needs of an increasingly global customer base. Our sales teams are doing a good job maintaining deal discipline, presuming the right mix of deals in terms of size, power density and application type to enhance price realization and keep new deal pricing steady. As a result, our pipeline and quarter coverage ratios remain healthy and in line with our annual operating plan.","So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to review the financials for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor","Great. Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'm pleased to provide you with additional detail on the first quarter of 2013. With the exception of our consolidated financial results, the majority of our other key non-financial metrics exclude the impact of ALOG, ancotel and Asia Tone.","So starting with Slide 5 from the presentation posted today. Global Q1 revenues were $519.5 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter increase and up 17% over the same quarter last year. Our Q1 revenue performance reflects a $2.3 million negative currency headwind when compared to the average rates used in Q4 and a $2.5 million negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. When adjusted for these changing FX rates, revenues were at the top end of our guidance range.","Turning to Slide 6. We wanted to highlight the diversification of our revenues across our regions, our verticals and our product categories. Interconnection services represent 15% of our revenues, a key metric that we remain focused on as we develop new ecosystems. The operating performance of the business remained strong as we invest across a number of fronts. Specifically, our gross margin -- our cash gross margin and our operating profits are all trending positively after taking into account the significant investments in our global sales and marketing functions and our corporate functions.","Global cash gross profit for the quarter was $356.7 million, a 3% increase over the prior quarter and up 16% over the same quarter last year. Cash gross margins were a healthy 69%, consistent with the prior quarter and the same quarter last year, although better than planned due to lower payroll costs and utility expenses.","Global cash SG&A expenses were $113.2 million for the quarter, a 5% increase over the prior quarter and slightly below our expectations due to lower professional and consulting fees and a smaller-than-expected advertising and promotion spend. Cash SG&A expense increased by 18% over the same quarter last year.","Global adjusted EBITDA was $243.5 million for the quarter, a 2% increase over the prior quarter and a 16% increase over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA growth reflects increased revenue performance, lower-than-expected utility costs and lower-than-planned SG&A spending. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance reflects a negative $900,000 currency effect when compared to the average rates used in Q4 and $1 million negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates.","Global net income attributed to Equinix was $35.9 million, down quarter-over-quarter primarily due to the $11.9 million after tax gain from the sale of our 16 IBXs in Q4 and up 4% on a year-over-year basis. Our fully diluted earnings per share was $0.71.","I'd now like to spend a minute on currencies. As you know, we're operating in a more volatile currency environment, and significant shifts in our operating currencies are having an impact on our quarterly results. Also, the recent fluctuations in exchange rate have created a currency headwind for us against the full year guidance. In addition to fluctuations in our major currencies, we've also seen large currency movements in other markets. For example, the Japanese yen, which represent 3% of our global revenues, devalued 14% against our budget rates in the quarter. Recognizing the change in currency landscape, we'll continue to provide through the FX rates used for the forward guidance, consistent with the details provided in our press release today.","Now let me turn to global MRR churn. As we had discussed last quarter, we expected elevated MRR churn over the next few quarters and anticipated it to moderate downwards over the second half of the year. As reported this quarter, MRR churn was 3.7%, higher than our expectations for the quarter, solely due to 1 large churn event that we knew would hit during the first half of the year, although it landed on the last day of Q1. This churn represents 0.7% of the Q1 metric. Absent this Asia Pacific churn, our MRR churn would have been 3%, consistent with our expectations. With this behind us, we believe we're past the high watermark and expect MRR churn to step down to approximately 2.5% per quarter for the remainder of the year. In this specific case, a large digital media and content customer will be transitioning to a multi-tier architecture in Asia Pacific, moving at server farms to their own data center while the core network nodes remain at Equinix. 20% of the space is already being rebooked, with the remainder expected to be sold by the end of Q3 of this year. Additionally, we expect to replace the MRR churn at better average price points.","Moving on to comments on REIT. With regards to the REIT, we continue to progress towards our goal of converting to a REIT beginning January 1, 2015, but at this stage, we have no additional details to share with you. On Slide 7, we summarize the various expected REIT cash costs and tax liabilities, similar to our discussion last quarter. In the second quarter, we expect to incur approximately $4 million in incremental cash costs related to the REIT program, which is reflected in our Q2 guidance. Separately, we've modified downwards our 2013 estimated cash tax liability now to a range between $150 million and $225 million.","Turning to Slide 8. I'd like to start reviewing the regional results, beginning with the Americas. Overall health of the Americas business remains strong. Average -- Americas revenues were $308.6 million, a 3% increase over the prior quarter and up 11% over the same quarter last year. Cash gross margins decreased slightly to 71%, largely due to the expansion drag from the newly opened IBXs. Cross-border bookings across all of our regions continue to be strong and validate our global platform strategy. Adjusted EBITDA was $146.5 million, although -- as a reminder, the Americas region absorbed the headquarter costs and the majority of the corporate overhead spend. The Americas region, excluding these costs, increased 1% over the prior quarter after absorbing higher costs related to the expansion drag from the new IBXs opened in the second half of 2012 and the annual FICA reset and up 13% over the same quarter last year. Corporate spending increased 13% over the prior quarter and 21% on a year-over-year basis. Americas adjusted EBITDA margin was 47% for the quarter. Americas net cabinets billing increased by 1,300 in the quarter, and MRR per cabinet remains steady within our targeted range, although down slightly over the prior quarter due to the timing of customer installations. Americas new logos increased 17% above the rolling fourth quarter average. Interconnection revenues remained at 20% of the region's recurring revenue, while net cross-connect adds rebounded to 1,300 for the quarter.","Now looking at EMEA. Please turn to Slide 9. Despite the macroeconomic uncertainty across this region, EMEA had record bookings this quarter and maintains a very healthy pipeline. The U.K. had a positive start to the year, with strength in the financial services, content and cloud verticals. Our Netherlands and France teams are progressing well against their operating targets with the newly opened Amsterdam 3 and Paris 4 IBX assets. EMEA revenues were $120.3 million, up 2% sequentially and 16% on a year-over-year basis normalized with constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $49.1 million or an adjusted EBITDA margin of 41%. Normalized and on a constant currency basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 7% compared to the same quarter last year. EMEA interconnection revenues remained at 7%, adding approximately 700 net cross-connects in the quarter. Net cabinets billing increased by approximately 400.","And now looking at Asia Pacific. Please refer to Slide 10. Asia Pacific had solid sales momentum this quarter, driven by wins in the cloud, digital media content and financial verticals. Asia Pacific revenues were $90.6 million, up 1% sequentially or 4% on a constant currency basis and up 24% on a normalized and constant currency basis over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $47.9 million, up 10% quarter-over-quarter or 33% on a normalized and constant currency basis over the same quarter last year. MRR per cabinet remained strong, with a 2% sequential increase on an FX neutral basis. Cabinets billing decreased by approximately 400 compared to the prior quarter, solely due to the timing of a large cabinet churn. Interconnection revenues were 11% of the region's recurring revenues. Through the quarter, we added approximately 400 net cross-connects, with a positive shift from copper to fiber as customers migrate to higher bandwidth-consuming business practices.","And now looking at the balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 11. In March, we raised $1.5 billion of high-yield notes at a blended interest rate of 5.2%. In Q2, part of the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem our $750 million 2018 senior notes, while $81 million was used to settle the make-whole payment to the bondholders, which was effectively the interest that would have been earned for the March 1, 2014 call date, plus an applicable premium. This net present value positive financing accomplished a number of objectives for the company, including improving our financial flexibility specifically related to restricted payments; placing long-dated debt on our books at a preferential interest rate; and providing the company with sufficient capital to continue to scale the business while meeting discrete funding requirements as we progress towards REIT conversion. In Q2, we'll record a onetime charge to the income statement of approximately $90 million as a loss on debt extinguishment, which is effectively the make-whole payment, plus the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash and investments. Looking at the liability side of the balance sheet, pro forma for the redemption of the senior notes, we ended the quarter with net debt of $2.6 billion, about 2.6x our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Going forward, we'll continue to review and optimize our balance sheet and capital structure.","Now looking at Slide 12. Our Q1 operating cash flow decreased to $84.2 million due to shifts in our working capital balances, including an increase in our DSOs to 33 days, the timing of cash interest payments on our outstanding debt and the payout of our corporate bonus program. For 2013, we expect our adjusted discretionary free cash flow, excluding any REIT-related cash costs or taxes, to range between $620 million and $640 million. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding $836 million of cash placed into an escrow account to fund the redemption of our senior notes, was a positive $30 million for the quarter.","Now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 13. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $75.7 million, well below our expectation, solely due to the timing of cash payment to our contractors. Ongoing capital expenditures were $34 million, which included less than $10 million in maintenance, efficiency enhancement and single points of failure capital.","Finally, turning to Slide 14. The operating performance of our 24 North American IBX and expansion projects that have been open for more than 1 year continue to perform well. Currently, these projects are 82% utilized, in January have 35% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested. Our 8 oldest U.S. IBXs grew 5% year-over-year, as customers continue to purchase additional power and cross-connects.","So at this point, let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Thanks, Keith. Let me now shift gears and cover our outlook for 2013 on Slide 15. For the second quarter of 2013, we expect revenues to be in the range of $530 million to $534 million. Cash gross margins are expected to range between 68% and 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between $120 million and $124 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $240 million and $244 million. Capital expenditures are expected to range between $170 million and $180 million, including approximately $45 million of ongoing capital expenditures. The increased CapEx guidance for Q2 reflects an increase in payments related to the shortfall that Keith just discussed in Q1.","For the full year of 2013, we are maintaining total revenue expectation at greater than $2.2 billion or greater than 16% growth on a year-over-year basis, which absorbs roughly $21 million of currency headwinds relative to guidance rates provided on our last call. Total year cash gross margins are expected to be between 68% and 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between $490 million and $510 million. We are maintaining expected adjusted EBITDA for the year to be greater than $1.01 billion, which absorbs roughly $9 million of currency headwinds relative to prior guidance rates and also includes $20 million in REIT conversion costs. We are maintaining our total CapEx guidance for 2013 at a range of $550 million to $650 million, which includes $165 million of ongoing capital expenditures. We are investing in our business at a very attractive risk return profile, and we continue to achieve our targeted returns.","So in closing, we're off to another good start in 2013. The external secular trends driving vertical demand, combined with the maturation of our sales force and the moderation of churn, point to another year of strong and predictable growth. Our focus on building global interconnected ecosystems, along with a disciplined balance of top and bottom line growth, is providing us continued differentiation from our competitors. As a result, we are well-positioned to help our customers and new prospects accelerate their business performance and drive operational efficiencies in the most important markets in the world.","So let me stop here and open it up for questions. And, Fred, I'll turn it back over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Colby Synesael from Cowen.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I guess just to get a little bit of clarity on the churn. So you mentioned that going to 2.5%, I think, for the remainder of the year, which has obviously puts you at the high end of your long-term target range of 1.5% to 2.5%. Is that an indication that, really, on a go-forward basis, it's your view that we'll be back in that range? And then the second question, I just -- I saw in the press release last week when you were announcing the Singapore expansion, you talked about providing business suites in that facility, which is obviously an extension from what you're already doing with DC 10. Is this now some type of confirmation that you guys do believe having some type of wholesale blend does make sense in other markets and we should expect to see that in other press releases, I guess, as we move through the year?","Keith D. Taylor","Great. Good question. So Colby, I'll take the first question, and then I'll let the team sort of answer the second question here. As it relates to churn, clearly, the 0.7% increase in churn this quarter was something that we didn't originally anticipate. We knew it was going to, as I said, occur in the second -- or, sorry, the first half of the year, we thought it would be frankly in Q2, bump up forward [ph] to Q1. That left us at 3%. Had it stayed in the sort of the Q2 time frame, ideally, we would have been in the range that we've guided to, and that was sort of the 2.5% to 3.2% that we said that we'd experience over the next few quarters. All that said, with the acceleration of that forward and now it put us in a position we think we're over the hump. And we're comfortable at approximating what we think churn will be for the foreseeable future through the remainder of this year anyway at 2.5% per quarter, and that is an approximation. And again, as you probably know and as many of the listeners know in the call here, churn tends to be lumpy. Sometimes when a customer indicates to us that they're going to churn, it sometimes gets pushed out. In other cases, it gets accelerated. In this particular case in Singapore, this is a churn that we've been anticipating for over 2 years, and had just not -- had not happened. And then the team forecasted and budgeted it in their 2013 plan. And so we recognized that we thought it was going to happen this year, it just happened a little bit faster. And so there's no net revenue impact to us. It just affects -- affecting this 1 churn metric. But as a go-forward basis, recognizing that I said the churn will be lumpy, I think it's important to know that as a company, we recognize that churn is something that we want to pay close attention to. Yet at the same time, with the actions that we're taking and recognizing some of our customers will bifurcate their infrastructure, what it really does for us and what you've seen over the last few quarters is it's giving us great price stability. You see our margins have been accelerating. We're managing our CapEx differently. And so from our perspective, recognizing it is one metric and not necessarily all the metrics that we need to look at. It's something that we take into consideration. And as we go forward, we'll continue to give you a perspective on what we think will happen, but overall, I think we've got a pretty good track record of, one, telling you what's going to happen, when it's going to happen; and two, delivering on our financial expectations. And so as I said here, we've now taken that into consideration, and we believe on approximate 2.5% per quarter is what you should see through the remainder of this year.","Stephen M. Smith","And now to the second part of your question, Colby, in Singapore, you are accurate in that we are including a business suite hybrid model in Singapore, which is a little different than what Charles and his team has done in the Americas. But what we have learned off the back of what we did in DC, we've applied that learning elsewhere in the world, and we are considering other markets where it might make sense to have that product mix. Singapore is very unique, as Keith just described. The multiple tiers of the architecture do end up getting deployed in Singapore for companies that generally run their infrastructure for all their Asia Pacific business out of that market. So we see a little bit more dynamics in the Singapore market to support companies that want to deploy multiple tiers of their architecture into that market to support their Asia Pacific business. So we will follow that product line in a little different model, built in with the retail business in our next builds in Singapore. Charles, do you want to add?","Charles Meyers","Well, the only I would say is that adjusted statement is -- in terms of comparing that, making that a wholesale substitute. It's not really a wholesale substitute. I think it is an extension of our products that we believe is necessary to serve the full requirements of our customer set when they implement multi-tier architectures and need a larger footprint option. So it's not a direct substitute for the wholesale space, it's really for customers that really want to do these multi-tiered architectures with us, have a requirement for a service level that we deliver, a level of quality and service and reliability that we're known for. And so I wouldn't characterize it as a wholesale substitute, but I would say that we do believe it is an appropriate extension of our product continuum to continue to feed the sort of premium retail business that really drive the economics of the business.","Operator","Next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.","Unknown Analyst","This is Lisa [ph] for Simon. Can you elaborate a little bit more on your guidance for Q2 and maybe how that plays out for demand over the remainder of the year?","Keith D. Taylor","Just so we're clear, I just want to make sure, are you specifically talking about guidance as a whole? Are you referring to the quarter? I just want to make sure we knock the right point here.","Unknown Analyst","Yes, maybe color on both. So basically for next quarter and also kind of how you see growth coming on for the remainder of the year.","Keith D. Taylor","Okay. So let me just start. If you actually step back and look at our Q1 -- because I think -- obviously, you have to ground yourself first. How did we do in Q1 relative to what we said we'd do? And so as you know, if I take you back -- I'm going to take you back 2 steps here, first, coming out of 2012 Q4, we did $506.5 million. And so that was sort of the base, if you thought, the -- if you will, the entry point into 2013. As you might recall, there's a one-off benefit in there of $2.4 million. So normalized Q4 was $504 million. So the guidance that we give this quarter, we're looking really at a midpoint of $520-odd million, with a top line of $522 million. So we came in at $519.5 million. That absorbed $2.3 million of currency headwind. And so you're basically at the top end of the range, although this quarter, there is a $1 million one-off benefit that we -- with some complex accounting that we probably won't see in the forward quarters. So on an adjusted basis, this quarter, we sort of came in at $520.8 million. And so that sort of set the stage. We grew 3.3% quarter-over-quarter or roughly $16.7 million quarter-over-quarter. When I fast forward then, look at the guidance that we give of $530 million to $534 million for Q2 here, again, recognizing there's $3.7 million of currency headwind in that guidance but said differently, if we use the Q1 exchange rates for Q2, the guidance number would have been $3.7 million higher. So when you look at that on an adjusted basis and relative against the midpoint of what we're guiding to, we think we'll deliver roughly 3.3% incremental revenue growth. So having said that, the first 2 quarters -- so the first 2 quarters, we recognize that, clearly, we're growing below what we think the average is -- the average would be for the year, recognizing we'd give you a floor of 16%. And, again, I'm talking about the top line here. So what's happening for the second half of the year? Well, clearly, we've been very upfront by the fact that we've absorbed more churn. You can see that in our elevated churn metrics over the last few quarters. So number one, we think that's going to abate. Number two, we think the production out of the team and the gross volume is going to increase. And it's planned for us, how we set our plan up for 2013 and I think, what got approved by our board. So it's in anticipation that we see better gross production on the top line, less churn as we moderate it downwards through the remaining part of the year. And that would deliver greater than 5% growth for the next 2 quarters to take us through, say, greater than 5% growth for the next few quarters in Q3 and Q4 to get us at our -- what I'd call our floor of $2.2 billion or greater. And so that's basically how we sort of constructed our model. It's how we constructed it back in October when we first delivered it to you. And it's relatively consistent with what we've executed again thus far this year. So let me leave it there and just make sure I've answered your question.","Operator","Next is Brett Feldman from Deutsche Bank.","Jiorden Sanchez - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Jiorden Sanchez calling in for Brett. Just have a similar, I guess, line of questioning on the EBITDA line. I guess, obviously, it's benefiting from some of the back half trends in revenue, but we're seeing a sequential decline in revenue, it seems, into 2Q on EBITDA. Is there anything that's particularly driving that? And then I have 1 quick follow-up question.","Keith D. Taylor","Again, there's a couple of things that are going on in EBITDA. And so look, without getting into too much detail of sort of trying to take it to a different level, when you look at the midpoint of our Q2 guidance, we're at roughly the same level. And I say that because this quarter, we did 2 -- Q1, we did $243.5 million. If you take out that one-off revenue benefit I referred to, you're basically $242 million. The midpoint of our guidance for this quarter is $242 million. So what's happening? Number one, utilities, we're going to increase our utilities by approximately $7 million this quarter, Q2 over Q1. That's one thing. Second thing is professional fees, a lot of it related to the work we're doing on REIT and the implementation of our other tax strategies. That's going to be $4 million increase over the prior quarter. So those two alone, that's an $11 million increase. And then you take into consideration the salaries and benefits. As I said in my prepared comments, the FICA reset that we experienced in Americas in Q1, the net benefit we get is we get actually a net decrease in salaries and benefits in Q2 by $1 million. So those 3 items alone is a net cash increase of $10 million. And so when you look at that relative to what we think we can do for the rest of the year, we -- similar to revenues, we think we can accelerate through this, through the spend program that we have and deliver EBITDA margins at the level that we suggested. And then to ground everybody, again, we said we could do $1,010 billion, so $1,010,000,000 of EBITDA in 2013. When you take into consideration the $9 million hit related to currency, that's effectively almost a $1,020 billion number relative to what we previously provided. As we go through the year and continue to manage our spend, we'll update you on every single quarter. But we feel relatively comfortable in the guidance that we've delivered from an EBITDA perspective. Recognizing the timing of expenses is something that we're going to pay a lot of attention to. But overall, we think we can deliver on or about that 46%, 47% EBITDA margin level.","Charles Meyers","I think it may be worth noting is that the -- Keith mentioned in the script, the expansion drag, particularly in the Americas where we put, in the last 7 months about 6,000 cabinets capacity online, including 4 net new locations. And so we felt that in Q1. We'll continue to feel that into Q2, but then we'll see that ease as we ramp into those locations in the latter half of the year.","Operator","Next is Gray Powell from Wells Fargo.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. Maybe just a bigger picture question. One of the main themes we've heard this year is that cloud computing is impacting managed hosting and other parts of the traditional data center. Can you give us a sense as to the applications that need to be on physical servers in low latency environments versus those that can reside in the cloud? And then just kind of help us convince people why Equinix is somewhat immune from the trend.","Stephen M. Smith","Start on the Americas, Charles, and I'll chime in.","Charles Meyers","Yes. I mean, I think that there's -- I mean, there's a number of things that I think that -- areas where people really require a level of flexibility, security and latency performance. That's when I think a colocation-type strategy versus a traditional cloud or virtual machine strategy tend to resonate. We see that in customers all the time. And so I think that it's -- it really depends on the complexity and the level of change that is part of it. So if it's raw compute, raw storage, those kind of things tend to lend themselves well to a public cloud type of environment. But even that, again, benefits us in terms of the relationships that we have with some of those providers and the Direct Connect kind of connectivity that we can provide to customers there. So I think that right now, we're seeing that cloud computing overall is a net add in terms of people being more creative about how they are deploying applications. And, again, certainly, a portion of those are going into hybrid cloud architectures because of either security, latency or manageability kind of reasons.","Stephen M. Smith","Gray, this is Steve. The only thing I'd add to that -- and a lot of this, it does emanate in the Americas initially and then we end up on the same trends in Europe and Asia. But some of these big secular trends that we talk about are really underpinning a lot of this, as Charles just alluded to. So as I talked about in my prepared comments, SaaS, Software-as-a-Service is probably 70% to 80% of the activity we're seeing today of the cloud workloads coming into Equinix. And so that is a big driver. The Infrastructure- and Platform-as-a-Service players are starting to come in, as I also indicated. But historically, we've gone from very low single-digit percent of our business being cloud-related to 24% today over the last 3 or 4 years. It is clear to us, as you look at all the industry verticals, that all CIOs around the planet are putting some workloads -- some type of test and development at least into cloud environments. And so it streams across many application fronts. Big Data is a good example. So all the Big Data players today use Equinix in many forms and fashions around the world. And so they're moving big cloud or Big Data workload in and out of the cloud. They like us because we've got public cloud nodes in here. We've got the private cloud nodes, and we're creating this hybrid environment for them. So they can move all kinds of workloads, but as Charles said, it's mostly mission-critical, real-time, high-performance-type applications that are finding their way into our IBXs.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And then just one more, if I may. I think you may have touched on this already, but can you talk about the pricing environment in the U.S.? And then just generally speaking, what percentage of deals or bookings, are customers taking something like 40 or 50 cabinets in 1 location?","Charles Meyers","Yes, I'm happy to take that. So overall, again, as Steve indicated, pricing remains pretty steady in the Americas. We really -- we look at 2 primary revenue or pricing-related metrics, the revenue yield or MRR per cab, which, again, we saw slightly down in the Americas this quarter in the metrics that we send out to you guys driven by 3 factors. One, our Q4 number is a little bit inflated due to some accounting adjustments and increase to revenue but weren't recurring in nature. And we're starting to see some impact of product mix as we introduce business suites into the mix. But the largest impact is really just due to, as Keith said, to customer installs and terminations and the timing of those. And so we expect to continue to stay in a very positive range from a revenue yield standpoint. In terms of new deals on an MRR per kilowatt basis, which is typically what we assess those on, again, it depends -- it varies across our assets but continues to be pretty firm on an apples-to-apples basis. And in terms of the percentage that is in larger deals, we have a sort of a more ideal mix in our minds of what we want to see, and our business mix continues to reflect that. This was a quarter where we had, actually, our third-largest bookings quarter ever in the Americas and did that without really large deals. Our other large bookings quarters that were larger than this one typically had the benefit of some sort of very large deals in those quarters, whereas this quarter, we did it with a series of more midsize deals, as well as continued strength in the smaller deals in our sweet spot. So we're seeing -- and those tend to be firmer in terms of pricing. So like, for example, in our network vertical, we were actually up in terms of price per kilowatt, and then we realized we were a little down in cloud because of a few larger deals with some key customers. But overall, we're seeing it as pretty firm in the market.","Operator","Next is Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore Partners.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","A couple of detailed questions, if I may. First, can you, Keith, break out the revenue from -- that's not associated with cabinets, the ancotel, Asia Tone, ALOG revenues?","Keith D. Taylor","I certainly can. Let me look up each of those specific things for you, Jonathan. Do you have a follow-on question?","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes. No, no. Absolutely. You talked about the higher churn or the big churn event in the Asia Pac region. As we look at the cabinets, I think the cabinets came down in that region in the quarter. So are we going to see further cabinet declines as a result of that piece of churn? Or is that now reflected in the cabinet count as of the end of the period?","Keith D. Taylor","Yes, great question. So the cabinet count is fully reflected in those, over 500 cabinets, 519 cabinets to be very specific, that occurred in the Singapore market. I think there's 2 things I'd like to leave with you. One is the customer chose to build in that environment. Many years ago, when it was -- without getting into all the specifics, I think a lot of it was driven through the EDB, which is basically the development arm, if you will, of the Singaporean government. And so there's a lot of tax incentives for what they did. That is atypical for what we see with our large customers in that market. Most of them like to reside in a facility like Equinix or potentially one of our competitors. So from a cabinet perspective, that's done. What we're now going to absorb unfortunately and what is reflected in our guidance, of course, is the cabinets stopped billing on the last day, if you will, of the quarter. So as a result, that $1 million churn or thereabout is going to -- we're going to feel the full impact of that in Asia Pacific through the next quarter. And so when you look next quarter, when we give you, if you will, the final results for Asia Pacific, it's going to be very much muted because of that large churn event.  And let me just answer your other question, Jonathan, if I may. And so from a revenue perspective, again, it's something that we probably don't want to keep on doing because we're -- if you will, the ancotels and the Asia Tones are getting fully integrated into our businesses. But let me at least just give it to you for this quarter. ancotel did -- just over $6.3 million for the quarter. Asia Tone did $11.4 million. And then ALOG did just under $21 million. Again, a little bit -- they were a little bit aided by some positive currency with the Brazilian real. But overall, that's the numbers that we had for those 3 assets.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Understood. It just makes it easier for forecasting to have the Ps and Qs. And so this helps us back it out. But I understand that you're not going to want to break it out indefinitely. I do have just a couple other things here. We did see a pretty big margin move in both Asia Pac and Europe in the quarter, more dramatic in the Asia Pac region. And I was wondering if you might comment on that. And then finally, if you could tell us where we are in kind of the sales force ramp and the productivity and the success, that would be really helpful.","Keith D. Taylor","Yes. Asia Pacific, yes, they actually had a pretty healthy increase in margins quarter-over-quarter. Part of it was due to this one-off benefit I alluded to. There was a, in fact, $1 million one-off benefit that they hadn't planned for in the revenue line. We're now hedging -- it's very much a very complex accounting issue that we have on that revenue line in Singapore. We're now hedging against that effectively on a go-forward basis. So you shouldn't see that again. So part of it, if you take out $1 million of effective pure profit, that will give you a better perspective. In addition, there was just some timing of their spend. And so I would think they'll get back to their traditional levels in the range between 48% and 50% for the remaining part of the year.","Charles Meyers","Yes. And then relative to the -- to sales force evolution, I'll speak to the Americas, we're probably the furthest along in terms of the evolution and adjustment. So the sales teams that we've making and overall, I continue to be very pleased with that progress. The key metric that I watch carefully is median rep productivity. Averages jump around a little bit if you're closing large deals, but the median gives you a good sense for baseline performance. And we continue to see tenured rep median performance actually trending back towards historic norms despite the fact that we've pared down territories and redistributed customer patches to the new reps and seeing nice, healthy up and to the right median performance from the new rep population, indicating that the baseline performance is improving and that we should have continued upside potential in our gross bookings performance. So very pleased overall. I think we're realizing pretty significant benefits from the vertical alignment and get strong performance in our mature verticals and, as you said, record quarter in cloud this quarter and really seeing some of the emerging verticals really begin to perform. So overall, I think very solid and we'll continue to press on it.","Stephen M. Smith","The only color I would add, Jonathan, on top of that from an Asia and a European standpoint is that, actually, I don't think we mentioned on this call yet, but actually, Europe had its highest production of bookings this past quarter. So even with the macroeconomic situation in Europe, that team is performing very, very well, primarily driven by the fact we're concentrated in these more robust, stronger markets. But generally, what Charles just described is happening across all 3 regions. Funnel and coverage ratios are in good shape, the deal discipline is taking hold across all the countries and all the regions. So we're globally doing deal reviews, and we're making good long-term decisions. And the vertical orientation of the sales force in the marketing organization is really helping us have just better conversations with customers. So we really understand the mix of applications coming into these IBXs. So generally speaking, everything is moving in the direction that Charles described on a global basis.","Operator","Next is David Barden from Bank of America.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Obviously, my usual guidance question kind of got hit early, so I do have 2 though. First would be, Keith, during the quarter you mentioned you did a redemption. You took out one of your most restrictive high-yield securities. You've opened up roughly $1 billion of RP basket that you could be deploying to any number of options. Your leverage is half a term below your target and improving as EBITDA grows and cash flow grows over the course of the year. Yes, you've got some taxes. Yes, there might be an E&P distribution 1 year and change down the road. But what would be the best reason that you can give that you shouldn't be buying back stock with the new freedom you have and the cash flow you have and the leverage capabilities you have? Because it seems like it would be the right thing to be doing at this stage of the game to lower the future dividend burden on the business. And then, I guess, second would just be big picture. It sounds like a softball, but when people saw the churn number, there was a lot of hyperventilation in the aftermarket. Obviously, the stock has recovered pretty strongly as the course this call is going on. But the reason why I think people are hyperventilating is because you see Rackspace getting crushed when they lower cloud pricing or you see companies that sell into data centers, talk about how they can't sell anymore because businesses aren't making decisions. And yet you guys are able to come up and deliver kind of quarter-after-quarter. What makes this sale so much better, so much easier to make than all these other guys who seem to be struggling in the \"data center market?\"","Keith D. Taylor","Why don't I take the first one? I think Charles will take the second one. I think the highest level and part of my comment around, we have $1.2 billion of cash, we raised the money at the time partly because we wanted to make sure we could do that, do what I call positive trading, knowing that we had to eventually take out these 2018 bonds to give us that financial flexibility to either purge pre-REIT conversion or to disburse dividends on a post-REIT converted basis. And so probably the largest one thing I'd tell you, David, and to the listeners on the phone, plus all the investors that I've spoken to over the last few quarters, is recognizing we're going to have some pretty big cash payments over the foreseeable future. Without fully understanding yet exactly how the funds are going to flow through the organization and what the optimal capital structure is, which very much is going to depend on what we hear back from the IRS vis-\u00e0-vis our request for a private letter ruling, it's just premature. In the end, we want to make sure we maintain all the flexibility in the organization so that we can get the funds in the right locations because the complexity of our model is vastly different than many others who are converting to REIT because a large piece of our business is offshore. And as I said, by 2015, roughly 50% of our revenues are going to be outside of the Americas. So for that very reason, you're going to see us refinance at the right time, recognizing that there's a lot of noise in the global market. We thought it was the right thing to do at the right time, but it also gives us the flexibility to now make some decisions on how we deploy that capital. We recognize we want to continue to grow, we got to take care of the shareholders, we got to get to the REIT conversion, we got to fund this organic expansion. And as I said previously, I think there's a scenario, if we deliver on the plan that we have set ourselves on this year, the fact of the matter is, CapEx is going to -- we're going to spend more in 2014 than we're going to spend in 2013. And as a result, you got to make sure you have the capital to fund that growth. So there's a lot of things going on. And all I'd ask of you and then the rest of the listeners is we recognize that there's a lot of cash on the balance sheet. We're half a turn under. But I think all it takes is a payment to the IRS, and basically, you're right at the low end of our range. And then a couple other things that we could do and all of a sudden, you've got a much better cash position vis-\u00e0-vis what our debt load is. So why don't I turn it over to Charles.","Charles Meyers","Yes, happy to answer that question, David, relative to -- I think what you're hearing from us, and again, maybe Steve can pile on here on the back-end, but I think a solid strategy that we have communicated to you over the past couple of years and I think the courage to execute on that strategy in a disciplined fashion. And I think that even in the face of making some decisions around the churn and living through those headwinds and making good long-term decisions that will generate the kind of returns that we believe are there for us in the business. And I think the reason that -- directly to your question of why it is easier for us to deliver than perhaps others who might claim, would want to have a similar value proposition is because I think we are selling based on value to deliver to our customers. A significant portion of our customer set is service providers that have a significant revenue off of the back end of the services that they deploy into our centers. And they value what we deliver, which is high-performance, low latency, mission-critical reliability, global reach that simply others just don't have the ability to compete on a head-to-head basis. And so we, whereas others, I think, in a more broadly defined data center space, which people seem to want to throw all into 1 bucket, often find themselves with the only lever they have in their hand to win a deal being price. And they end up in a very uncomfortable situation in terms of margin performance and the subsequent capital intensity of their business because they can't sustain price points and really deliver value. And so I think that's why we are having good success in the market. I think we're seeing a set of secular trends around the emergence of cloud into all of our verticals around mobility, around various other trends that I think keep the wind at our back. And I think as long as we remain disciplined about selling into targeted application sets, that meet the Platform Equinix profile, I think, we'll continue to see solid results.","Stephen M. Smith","The only thing I'd add -- David, I thought you asked at the tail end of your question that -- how are we having record bookings in our cloud business when it seems like other companies that are in that space are fighting and lowering price and battling it out? Remember, our whole strategy is to be the home of as much cloud as we possibly can, private, public hybrid, all flavors of it. And so we're enabling these companies. Some are going to win, some are going to lose, but we're not caught in the middle of that price war. We're enabling these companies to come in and get access to our 4,000 customers and set up shop so they can deliver cloud services out to the world. So we're in this neutral position and the fact that cloud is bleeding into every industry vertical and our entire sales force is selling in each vertical, cloud is not just an industry vertical, even though that's how we report it, it's happening in each of the industries. And so it's proliferating at a pretty good rate.","Operator","Our last question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Can you give us an idea of any other sort of server farm exposure that we might need to be aware of that could churn? I mean, you talked about kind of coming off the tail end of that. Is that more the tail end for this year or the tail end kind of ever? Or should we look for any more of this churn? And then at some point, is it appropriate for you guys to move to reporting on more of a megawatts under roof, when we talk to other colocation providers and private folks and they tend to think and talk in the industry in that term? And at what point would you move to that sort of reporting versus the cabinets?","Charles Meyers","Frank, this is Charles. I'll let Keith handle the second part of that. But as to the first question around \"server farm exposure,\" et cetera, I will say that as we have indicated, we feel a comfort level of level that we've turned the corner on churn, in part just because we have very good visibility to our book of business to contract expirations to how our customers are viewing their architectural evolutions, et cetera. And in previous calls, people have asked me to say how far along are we in IBX optimization, et cetera. I would say we're well-advanced in terms of saying that we have worked through much of the exposure that was there, and that was causing the elevated churn, which is why we came onto the call today and indicated a turning point. However, I would also say that evolution of architectures by customers as they grow is something that's natural and inherent to our business. And so it's not going to go away. We're not going to work it all out and assess them then never see it again. That's simply not the way it works. But by having good discipline on the front-end, by having solution architects engage with our customers to talk through how they evolve their architectures and by virtue of the fact that we simply do not have a concentrated business, neither in terms of revenue, customer exposure, vertical exposure, et cetera, we can handle a customer who we believe, working with them, ought to move to a multi-tiered architecture. We can handle that within the scale of the business. So it's not something that is -- it isn't going to go away. I do think we work through some nonrecurring exposure, if you will, that was just cleaned up on many years of trying to get after that. And I think we've done that now. We feel comfortable with our ability to turn the corner. But it won't completely go away. But we feel comfortable with what we've articulated to you in terms of what that implies for go-forward churn.","Stephen M. Smith","And Frank, said another way -- and then Keith can have the megawatt question. But said another way, we've made a business decision here to catch -- and we do very frequently very high-growth companies that will continue to scale with us around the world, and at some point, they're going to get big enough where they're going to consider building their own data center or doing, as Charles just described, this bifurcation or multi-tiered architecture. And they're going to naturally churn out. But for that time period, while they're growing and they're young, they're going to grow inside of Equinix, and we'll help them do that. And that will be the business model. And so we're going to continue to find companies that are high-growth companies, that will get to a certain stage in their evolution and they're going to bifurcate it or they're going to get more sophisticated on their multi-tiered architecture. And as Charles just described, you'll have that phenomenon. So the churn is going to -- we're going to have some amount of churn for those types of customers.","Keith D. Taylor","Frankly, it really is about the discipline and then just being able to make sure that we forecast and understand what's happening with the customer. And Charles alluded to the fact that he gets a very good understanding of his business on what -- where the contracts are, where the expiration dates are and what the risk exposure is to our customer renewing. So all that said, I think at this stage, we feel pretty comfortable with what we have. And to the extent it happens different than that, we're going to update you and give you a sense of what's going on. But right now, we're very comfortable with where we are. So dealing -- last point was dealing with the question on reporting. I think it's important to recognize that -- you said, like many others report megawatts, you have to recognize, we don't think we're on the same supply and demand curve as many of our theoretical competitors. I think we have a different customer set that we look at. And not just that you asked, as we move towards REIT conversion that an alteration of our market metrics is not appropriate. I think we're going to look at that to make sure we can effectively communicate to the market, what's going on in the business, recognizing we could have a different investor set or at least a mix of our investor set. And so we have to recognize that, that metric might change. But suffice it to say, I also think it's important to recognize we have 4,500 customers. The average size of our deals are a lot smaller, and I'm not so sure stelling [ph] on megawatt is the right metric to give you a sense of where the market is moving. So right now, we're going to keep it at MRR per cab. We might occasionally talk about it, revenue per kilowatt, because that's a very good metric. It boils it all down to, if you will, the base, if you will, which is really our consumption. And then we'll also consider other metrics. And so give us some time in that. As we evolve to REIT conversion, we'll certainly be thinking about what alternate key metrics we might want to share with the market through that process.","Katrina Rymill","Thank you.

Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Smith","Okay. Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This marks our 50th quarter of consecutive revenue growth. We deliver both revenue and adjusted EBITDA significantly above the top end of our guidance ranges, while global demand for interconnected data centers drove record net bookings and our second best gross bookings.","This momentum reflects our strategic position in the digital economy and the value of our global platform in addressing customer needs. Additionally, we are extremely well positioned to capture a sizable share of enterprise demand, driven by a variety of factors, including a rapid adoption of hybrid cloud as the architecture of choice.","As depicted on slide 3, revenues were $665.6 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 10% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $311.3 million for the quarter, up 2% over the prior quarter and up 13% year-over-year, delivering a 47% margin. AFFO grew 18% year-over-year to $221.4 million. The benefits of operational discipline and a strategic approach to meeting customer demand, continued to manifest and stable pricing, firm yields, and one of the lowest churn quarters on record.","We now have 6,300 customers around the globe, including more than 100 of the Fortune 500. Over 4,000 Equinix employees support our operations, product development and the execution of our go-to-market strategy, to offer the only global interconnection platform in the largest retail data center footprint worldwide. With over 161,000 cross connects and vibrant use of our internet and cloud exchange offers, we sit at the crossroads of the internet, where customers locate inside Equinix to innovate and accelerate their businesses.","Interconnection is 17% of our recurring revenue, making it a $400 million annual business, $400 million. The scope, scale, reach and diversity of our platform remain without parallel. We are continuing to invest in systems, processes and people, to ensure consistent service delivery on a global basis and manage the complexities associated with a massively scaled retail business, rapidly approaching 20,000 customer deployments and generating over 0.5 million customer interactions each quarter.","We are now live across all regions with Equinix Customer One; our initiative to streamline our 'Quote to Cash' process and standardize our products and services worldwide. This is a major milestone in our drive for global consistency and a critical capability to scale our sales engine and provide a high quality experience for customers.","The importance of global selling is reflected in the business we are winning. Today, over 50% of our revenue comes from customers deployed globally across all three regions and over 80% is from customers deployed across multiple metros, showcasing how customers leverage platform Equinix to support their businesses.","Turning to the Telecity acquisition, we continue to expect this compelling combination to deliver solid value to shareholders of both companies. Telecity announced solid quarterly results this morning, which were consistent with our expectations. Regarding the regulatory status of the deal, Equinix has received approval of our request to work through the EU Commission to secure clearance for the acquisition and the efficient process that will use a single regulatory authority to evaluate this transaction.","In anticipation of the expected close in the first half of 2016, we have multiple teams working together to map out an immigration plan and determine the optimal organizational structures. We continue to believe the deal offers the opportunity to increase networking cloud density to better serve customers and will enhance our existing European portfolio.","As it relates to the broader M&A landscape, we have our eye on the consolidation activity happening in our industry, and will continue to be both proactive and highly selective in pursuit of opportunities that we believe complement our strategy and create significant shareholder value.","Interconnection is a critical source of sustaining value for Equinix and we continue to invest here, in order to maintain market leadership and execute on our highly differentiated strategy which is centered on creating and curating digital ecosystems. Revenue from interconnection grew 15% year-over-year and we added over 6,100 cross connects this quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter delivering at this level.","Connection to cloud providers from buyers across all vertical markets is a strong driver of interconnection; and we also see growth in connectivity among content in network companies, as the exponential growth in data drives the need for more pairing.","Our digital exchange has experienced a sizable increase in both traffic and ports, with a step up of 158 ports added on our internet exchange.","Fiber and ecosystems where multiple customers are interconnected within a datacenter, generate attractive returns. Our portfolio of stabilized assets continues to grow at 4% and is tracking to over 32% yields on our gross PP&E investments. The majority of our development pipeline is allocated to current campus expansions to meet demands of existing customers and achieve operational scale that maximizes returns, while mitigating risk.","Now let me shift to cover the quarterly highlights from our vertical industries. Inside our datacenters, networks, clouds IT service companies and enterprises are interconnecting to offer businesses, improve service delivery and performance by putting systems, applications and data closer to end users.","In the network vertical, we delivered solid growth this quarter, with network expansions across all regions to support traffic growth and deliver new cloud services. Network-to-cloud-cross connects doubled year-over-year, as providers deploy new routes to connect traffic and services. There are a variety of catalysts generating growth in the network segment, including mobile computing, which is changing how service providers and enterprises interact. Equinix is benefiting from the proliferation of mobile applications and content, with increased demand driving new interconnection activity.","Mobile operators and major content companies are using Equinix data centers to peer mobile content, aggregate networks, facilitate mobile payments, and deploy roaming exchanges.","For the content and digital media vertical, growth was driven by global expansions from players including Criteo, a global French technology company specializing in performance marketing; and Tencent, a Chinese media and entertainment and internet firm. We are also seeing an emerging opportunity to support media and entertainment companies that are moving workloads to the cloud, leveraging Equinix and the cloud services inside our facilities to collaborate on production and editing.","Turning to the financial services vertical, we see continued diversification in this segment, with a series of lighthouse wins in insurance, electronic payments and asset management. New customers this quarter include AIA, a top Asian insurance firm. Currenex, a top 10 foreign exchange, that is deploying performance hub, as well as its matching engine in our Secaucus campus; and a top five global asset management firm that is deploying across Asia.","Turning now to cloud and IT services, we are experiencing continued momentum across the cloud ecosystem, which drove strong bookings this quarter, as major cloud players such as AWS, Datapipe, Oracle and ServiceNow continue to expand. Last quarter, we were a major partner of both Microsoft's worldwide partner conference, and a Google Cloud Platform Global Roadshow, where developers and partners were educated on how to leverage our industry leading cloud exchange capabilities.","Software based provisioning and control capabilities offered by the Equinix Cloud Exchange are a critical innovation in allowing customers to dynamically create and manage private, secure virtual connections to multiple cloud services over a single port. We continue to see momentum on the exchange, which is live in 21 markets globally, and has over 180 customers provisioned. In the second quarter, this solution was awarded the most innovative carrier cloud service by Light Reading, a powerful recognition of our progress and our commitment to delivering steady innovation.","To-date, our effort to build cloud density inside Equinix has primarily been focused on private connectivity. Particularly for leading infrastructure-as-service platforms, including AWS, Microsoft Azure and the Google Cloud platform. As customers expand their use of hybrid cloud, we are responding to offer cloud connectivity options, that significantly improve the end user experience for a wide range of software-as-a-service applications. Software-as-a-service is the largest segment in the cloud market, and is experiencing rapid adoption on [indiscernible] enterprises.","We have expanded our relationship with Microsoft, and later this year, we will begin offering direct access to Microsoft Office 365, breaking new ground with secure private connectivity, to one of the most widely used enterprise SaaS applications. We are building features and functionality on the cloud exchange to support this application, which paves the way for additional SaaS providers to deliver similar services.","We also continue to expand the diversity of service providers leveraging the cloud exchange, to deliver services to their customers. This quarter we announced an agreement with Aliyun, Alibaba's cloud computing arm, to provide dedicated and secured direct access to Aliyun's full suite of cloud services.","Turning now to the enterprise vertical; the enterprise vertical delivered record bookings, and we are seeing traction in penetrating these verticals, as customers seek to rearchitect their IT, to connect people, locations, clouds and data. We added a record number of new customers, including multiple Fortune 50 firms and secured performance hub wins with Carestream, a healthcare medical device company, and Harman, a premium audio equipment maker.","Our performance absolution is now the primary entry point for enterprise clients. Over 190 customers have deployed performance hub to optimize network architectures, distribute applications closer to end users, enable critical big data use cases and provide efficient secure private access to cloud services.","By deploying these solutions, customers are reducing operating expenses and improving application performance, as well as end user experience. For example, a global engineering and construction customer that deploy their performance hub solution at Equinix, increased bandwidth per employee by 2.5 times. They have reduced their operating expenses by 25% and improved application latency by 38%, which was critical for global workforce collaboration.","A Fortune 50 industrial conglomerate customer that migrated to a hybrid cloud architecture at Equinix, achieved a 30% cost reduction in cloud connectivity per acquisition, and over $8 million in annual operating savings.","Turning to our go to market strategy, we are expanding our routes to market through our global channel program, which now has over 200 partners, including referral partners, agents, resellers and cloud and technology partners, who are all implementing sell-through and sell-with models. The initial focus is on building the framework, programs and tools necessary to allow partners to effectively embed Equinix as a foundation for their enterprise solutions. Particularly with our resellers, who today are driving the majority of channel bookings.","For example, Telefonica, a leading global telecommunications provider and an Equinix certified reseller, is helping a key mobile company move to a cloud based business model. This customer required a large infrastructure enabler to help with their transition to cloud, and Equinix delivered a compelling global solution sold through Telefonica. So as we continue to see broad adoption of the hybrid cloud, we expect an increase in proportion of new growth to come through the channel.","So let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith, to cover some of the details and results for the quarter.","Keith Taylor","Great. Thanks Steve and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I am pleased to have this opportunity yet again to provide you an update on our quarterly performance. Q2 was another very strong quarter, with all three regions delivering better than expected results.","On a normalizing constant currency basis, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions delivered very healthy year-over-year revenue growth at 23% and 26% respectively, while our larger Americas region produced another double digit growth, 9.75% over the same quarter last year.","Our key operating and performance metrics continue to reflect the strength of the value proposition we deliver to our customers. We added 3,800 net billable cabinets in the quarter, our highest level of cabinet installs ever. This is effectively selling an entire capacity of two large data centers in one single quarter.","MRR per cabinet on an FX neutral basis was up slightly to $2,015 per cabinet or 1.2% quarter-over-quarter improvement, largely due to increased interconnection activity. Over the past three quarters, the business has shown signs of accelerated growth. Given our success over the first half of the year, particularly the strength of the gross and net bookings, we are meaningfully raising our guidance for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.","Updated revenue guidance now implies a normalizing constant currency growth rate of over 15% compared to the prior year, eclipsing last year's growth rate of 14%. Also we are very pleased to have completed the first six months of the year operating and reporting as a REIT, including paying our first two quarterly dividends, and announcing our third dividend earlier today.","We also received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS in May, which for all intents and purposes, matches the specifics of our desired REIT structure. The PLR ruled favorably on how we classify our revenues and assets. Basically, interconnection revenues are qualified REIT income and our data centers are qualified REIT-able assets.","Now moving to the slides; so as depicted on slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $665.6 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and up 16% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our revenue's overperformance was due to many factors, including strong bookings activity, higher than expected custom sales order activity, net positive pricing actions and lower than planned churn. Q2 revenues net of our FX hedges absorbed a $5.2 million negative currency headwind when compared to the average FX rates of last quarter.","Although currencies remain volatile throughout this quarter, across all of our operating currencies, there was no meaningful FX impact when compared to our guidance rates, as the EMEA net cash flow hedges continue to offset a good portion of the negative impact attributed to a stronger U.S. dollar.","Our global cash gross profit increased 2% over the prior profit, although our cash gross margin decreased margin decreased slightly due to higher seasonal utility rates. Global cash SG&A expenses increased $149.6 million due to increased sales compensation expense in the strong booking activity, and lower than planned capitalized IT costs, given the rollout in all three regions of our Equinix Customer One initiative.","Global adjusted EBITDA was $311.3 million, above the top end of our guidance range and up 3% over the prior quarter, and 18% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis; largely due to strong revenue flow-through.","Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $3.3 million currency impact when compared to the average rates used last quarter, and a $1.4 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates.","Global AFFO was $221.4 million or up 26% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our Q2 AFFO includes approximately $1.3 million in commitment fees related to the Telecity bridge loan. Global net income was $59.5 million or diluted earnings per share of $1.03, including the acquisition cost of $9.9 million.","Now over the next few quarters, we expect our net income to fluctuate due to acquisition and financing costs related to Telecity acquisition. Also, we will start to hedge out our Pound-Sterling net investment exposure for the acquisition.","As a heads-up, when we mark-to-market the hedges, whether realized or unrealized, the fluctuations will flow into the income statement on the other income and expense line, and therefore, may cause our go forward as reported GAAP earnings to fluctuate.","Global MRR churn for Q2 was better than expected at 1.8%, our fourth quarter in a low, this low a level. As previously stated, MRR churn is inherently lumpy, based on the timing of customer decisions, and therefore, as we look forward, we expect our quarterly MRR churn for each of the last two quarters of the year, to range between 2% and 2.5%, which includes some of the MRR churn originally expected to occur in Q2.","Now turning to slide 5, I'd like to start reviewing the regional results beginning with the Americas. The Americas region had a strong booking this quarter, lower than planned MRR churn and improved pricing metrics. On a normalized and constant currency basis, the Americas revenues was up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 10% year-over-year. Americas adjusted EBITDA was flat over the prior quarter, largely due to higher seasonal utility costs over the summer season and at 11% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Americas interconnection revenues represents 22% of the region's recurring revenues and we added 2,600 cross-connects and 102 exchange ports in the quarter. Americas net cabinets billing increased by 1,100 in the quarter.","For new builds, we are proceeding with our Dallas 7 project. This build strengthens our value proposition in the Dallas market, while taking advantage of our interconnection density and our other Dallas IBXs.","Now looking at EMEA, please turn to slide 6; EMEA delivered another strong quarter with record bookings. We continue to see strength in our Dutch and U.K. businesses, as cloud service providers continue to deploy across these markets. On a normalized and constant currency basis, revenues were up 7% quarter-over-quarter and 23% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin was up 7% over the prior quarter and 31% over the same quarter last year. We had another solid quarter of increased interconnection activity, adding 1,300 net cross-connects. EMEA interconnection revenues now represent 8% of the regions recurring revenues. EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant currency basis to $1,472 per cabinet, and net cabinet's billing increased by 1,500.","Over the quarter, we opened additional phases in our key data centers in Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris, and intend to proceed with a next phase of our Frankfurt 4 IBX to support the underlying demand in this robust and improving market for us.","And now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to slide 7; Asia-Pacific remains our fastest growing region, with revenues up 7% over the prior quarter and up 26% over the same quarter last year, on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by strong sales momentum across all our verticals. Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 10% over the prior quarter, and 33% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up over 50%, with strong improvement coming from our Japanese business.","MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis, was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, despite a number of large cloud-based deployments installed over the quarter. Net cabinets billings increased by 1,200 over the prior quarter and we added a healthy 2,200 net cross connects. Interconnection revenues remain at 12% of the region's recurring revenues.","For builds, we opened a new phase in Hong Kong this quarter and had seven expansions, and we have seven expansions currently underway across six metros, as we continue to scale our business across this region.","Now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to slide 8. At the end of the quarter, we added $436 million of unrestricted cash and investments, a large decrease over the prior quarter, principally due to the funds we escrowed for the Telecity acquisition and the increase in capital expenditures. Our net debt leverage ratio increased to 3.4 times of Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA, the result of reduced cash levels, and an increase in capital lease obligations.","As we look forward, we expect a pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA to temporarily creep above our stated target of three to four times to 4.5 times due to the Telecity acquisition. Although, given the cash flow attributes of our model, we should return to our target range over a reasonably short period of time.","Now switching to AFFO and dividends on slide 9; for 2015, we are rating our expected AFFO guidance to now range between $850 million and $860 million, an effective dollar increase of $25 million over prior guidance or a 90% increase year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, the result of strong operating performance.","Our AFFO guidance now includes approximately $6.8 million in costs related to the bridge loan. Also today, we announced our Q3 dividend of $1.69 a share, consistent with our prior quarterly dividends. Our AFFO pay out ratio equates to 45%. ","As we look beyond 2015, our retransitional year, we continue to believe that both organic and inorganic growth will be the primary ingredient for the steadily growing cash dividend, as well as moving more assets from the taxable REIT structure to the qualified REIT structure.","Now looking at capital expenditures, refer to slide 10 please; second quarter capital expenditures are $221.3 million, including recurring CapEx of $27 million. Given our strong and above expected performance year-to-date, we are closely assessing our inventory and build rates across our Tier-1 markets. It is our expectation, that our capital expenditures will now remain at the Q2 levels for the remainder of the year, and therefore we are raising our non-recurring or expansion CapEx for the full year to now range between $685 million to $735 million. Recurring CapEx is expected to remain consistent with our prior expectations at $115 million.","As presented on the expansion tracking slide, we currently have 15 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 14 are campus built or incremental phase builds. We are currently building across 11 metros worldwide, focusing on investments where we can deliver a differentiated offer and generate attractive returns. Prioritizing in those markets that support our key ecosystem objectives.","And finally turning to slide 11; operating performance of a stabilized 67 global IBX expansion projects have been open for more than one year, deliver steady as reported revenue growth of 4%, a decrease over the prior quarter, primarily due to stronger U.S. dollar. Currently, these projects generate a 32% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested, reflecting the premium value these mature campuses deliver, particularly where ecosystems are especially vibrant.","I will turn the call back to Steve now.","Steve Smith","Okay, thanks Keith. Let me now shift gears and cover the 2015 outlook on slide 15. For the third quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to range between $681 million and $685 million and normalizing constant currency growth rate of 3% quarter-over-quarter, which includes negligible foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rate sin Q2 2015.","Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $150 million to $154 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $313 million and $317 million, which includes a $1 million negative foreign currency impact, when compared to the average FX rates in Q2 2015. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $222 million and $242 million, which includes approximately $32 million of recurring capital expenditures.","For the full year of 2015, we are raising revenues to a range between $2.685 billion and $2.695 billion, a 15% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis, which includes negligible foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates. The revised revenues are a $55 million increase compared to our prior guidance.","Total year cash gross margins are expected to approximate 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $595 million to $605 million. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to range between $1.25 billion and $1.26 billion or at 46.7% adjusted EBITDA margin. This guidance includes $2 million of positive foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates, or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 18%. Excluding this positive currency impact, the revised adjusted EBITDA is a $23 million increase compared to prior guidance.","We expect adjusted funds from operations to range between $850 million and $860 million, or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of 19%. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $800 million and $850 million, which includes $150 million of recurring capital expenditures.","So in closing, we delivered a strong first half and are delighted to see momentum across all our industry verticals and geographies, as customers continue to select platform Equinix as the key enabler of IT transformation. We are pleased with our team's discipline and execution and the strength of our ecosystems is translating into solid revenue growth, firm pricing and expanding margins, all of which combine to give us the financial firepower to continue to invest in our global service delivery model and develop innovative solutions.","Our operating performance reflects the significant role we play in a rapidly evolving digital economy, and we will continue to focus on creating sustainable for our customers and our shareholders.","So let me stop here and open it up for questions, so I will turn it back over to you Kate.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question speaker is coming from Mr. David Barden from Bank of America. Sir, you may begin with your question.","David Barden","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Good quarter. I wanted to ask, maybe three if I could; just first Keith, I think you talked a little bit about North America, or maybe this was global on pricing, net positive pricing activity, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about, whether that's more geographic or contract specific? Second, I think the commentary, Keith, around the churn, around 2% to 2.5% is a bit higher than we would normally expect, if you could address if there are some specific expectations that you have for that, or is that just kind of a general conservative estimate? And then my last question maybe Steve, strategically I think we understand what Equinix is trying to do, become -- really kind of create these platforms, connect businesses to the cloud and be that glue. I think it's harder to see qualitatively in the business in terms of whether it's working and how it's contributing to revenue growth? If you could kind of put some meat on the bones quantitatively around watching this strategy unfold, it will be super helpful. Thanks.","Keith Taylor","Good questions David. First and foremost, as it relates to net positive pricing actions; we as a company, we continue to monitor how we perform as we renew our contracts with our customers. And clearly there are times, there are negative pricing actions, and of course, there is positive pricing actions.","Over the last few quarters, the message that we have been delivering, globally, we are seeing net positive pricing actions, which means the price increases are outweighing the [indiscernible] price decreases. So it\u2019s a global phenomenon, you can see it across affecting the price points. The MRR per cabinet yields [ph] across all three regions.","Second question to that I will take is on churn; when we looked at the year, certainly, we are very-very pleased with how we performed in Q1 at 2%. We were delighted with what we saw in Q2, 1.8%. But we really were trying to guide for the total year, somewhere between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, and we said the price is likely to the lower end. With our overperformance in Q2, we recognized that some of that is timing based, and therefore we are going to forecast it in Q3.","Equally, there is a churn that's going to take place in Europe that we are fully aware of and had planned for, where a customer had taken down a sizable piece of space in one of our important data centers, and it was going to get relocated this year, and this is -- something was planned for from the outset, and so we are going to absorb that churn in our Q3, and therefore Q4 results.","And so there is nothing fundamental going wrong with the business and nothing fundamentally causing us concern around the churn area. In fact, it\u2019s the exact opposite. We see great momentum but recognizing that churn is -- it is lumpy and it is sometimes based on how customers decide to notify why the churn, sometimes causes it to get a bit more allocated to one specific quarter or period. But nothing to be concerned about.","Steve Smith","And David, on the third component of your question; couple thoughts here, first of all in the quarter, this quarter, a little over 30% of our bookings this quarter came from cloud and IT services and almost 17% of the bookings came from the enterprise vertical. So in terms of creating this cloud environment to attract enterprise, as that is unfolding as we expected, and some of the steps that I spouted out to you, you have heard that we have had good success with both enterprises in the cloud vertical.","The other industry verticals continue to still underpin good growth, so we have got solid growth across content digital media, financial services and the networks suppliers, all actually also pursuing cloud with their end customers. So we are seeing the same trends as we think about the cloud, how it's affecting everybody.","So we have record net bookings this quarter. You heard me talk about key wins with the Fortune 50, so we are getting used cases and success stories built with big profile companies in several of the industry's segments that make up the enterprise. We are starting to crack into the Fortune 500 as I mentioned. We have got performance hub wins being deployed across multiple industry verticals.","So the overall strategy to become the enabler of this transformation to the cloud computing paradigm shift is working. The indirect channel is starting to show up for us. We are seeing these enterprises take advantage of the hybrid cloud at Equinix. Actually our acquisition that Charles and his team oversighted with this company called Nimbo, we are starting to see the professional service, traction take place to help companies bridge and find the hybrid cloud.","So there is good progress across lots of fronts here, lots of new logos. Charles, I don't know if there's anything you'd add to that?","Charles Meyers","No, I think you hit most of them. It is a little hard to see the impact at the sort of macro level of the publicly reported metrics. But I think as we dig down into the operating metrics that we are tracking on a week-to-week, month-to-month basis, I think we are definitely seeing the momentum in the numbers, that we feel, sort of more intuitively. And I think that includes, as Steve said, enterprise bookings over indexing relative to the revenue proportion, so that is a growing area. Enterprise and cloud combined, actually combining for the majority of our new logo capture, and so we are having success on both the supply side of cloud ecosystem, and now increasingly on the demand side, good traction in the channel with getting additional reach into the enterprise, and again, seeing overall, very solid results in interconnection, including what we track, which is interconnection between subsegments. Meaning for example, enterprise to cloud, cloud to network, etcetera, with really cloud being a primary driver point there.","So the underlying metrics are definitely indicating some good solid momentum.","David Barden","Got it. All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","Next one is coming from Mr. Michael Rollins from Citi Investment Research. Sir, you may begin with your question.","Michael Rollins","Thanks. I had one follow-up and one question. The follow-up is just the FX impact sequentially in the quarter, can you break that out between the gross FX impact and the hedge? And then you [indiscernible] more broadly, as you look at the performance in the second quarter and you look at the guidance for the year, how much of the improvement was from non-recurring revenue, which from my understanding, you were looking to decline over the next few quarters, after some strength in that metric in 2014, and how much is from the recurring revenue? Thanks.","Keith Taylor","So Mike, as it relates to the non-recurring activity, we saw a slightly elevated NRR activity this quarter, its roughly up $5 million over what we saw in the prior quarter. And so, again recognized when we had our guidance, we knew how we felt we are going to perform, and so it was generally -- most of that was embedded in our forward guidance. But we certainly are more elevated than we originally anticipated at the beginning part of the year.","And if you recall when we talked, again two quarters ago off the Q4 earnings call, at that time we were saying, that we were roughly $5 million below on a quarterly basis. And so all that being said a lot of the growth that you're seeing and the raise in the revenue line, it's attributed a long part to the non-recurring activity. So that's up, you know, again $15 million higher than we thought. The rest is coming from the fact that we are booking more. We are booking faster in the quarter. We are getting the price points, and we didn't experience a churn that we anticipated. And that has been the real driver of our success. It's more coming from the MRR, less coming from the NRR.","As it relates to the question on FX, as I said in my prepared remarks, there were our net exposure on the revenue line, relative to Q1 activity was a headwind of $5.2 million on the revenue line, $3.3 million on the EBITDA line. When we look at the net hedge impact quarter-over-quarter, it's basically a negative $700,000 on the revenue line, and basically a negative $400,000 on the EBITDA line. Again, that's taking the hedge that we had in place in Q1, or the benefit of the hedge that we had in Q1, and then offsetting it by the benefiting we had in Q2.","Michael Rollins","Okay. Thanks very much.","Keith Taylor","Yup.","Operator","Next one is coming from Mr. Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Sir, you may begin.","Jonathan Atkin","Thanks. So on the Telecity transaction and the regulatory scrutiny that's currently taking place at the EC level, I wondered if you can go into a little bit more detail? Although looking at this combination, surely, on a regional level or also at a national level? And is there antitrust review by country level governments, that goes on concurrently, should the review occur to the easy level of you [ph]?","And then on a related topic, just M&A, given the situation with Digital Realty and Telx, you're top customers of each of those companies. Just wondered, how to think about potential strategic or even commercial impacts on your business from that combination?","Steve Smith","Sure, why don't I start, and then Keith and Charles, why don't you guys kind of chime in. So let's start with the Telecity question Jonathan. As I mentioned in my comments, we are moving forward at the EU level with EU Commission, which we think is going to be a more efficient process, because we are dealing with a single authority. So that's the approach versus going country by country. So it will be a little bit more efficient we believe, and we got the approval to move forward with the antitrust review at that level. So I think that was the nature of your question; and we are well into that process. So we are full speed ahead with those interactions as we speak.","That doesn't change any of the timing for this, we are still anticipating a first half 2016 close and all the other commitments we made around value creation sources, etcetera, nothing has changed on any of that. The work that we are able to do now, because of the rules around the U.K. takeover panel, is that there is integration planning going on as I mentioned, Jonathan, and we have actually put retention and incentive programs in place. And as you heard on the results this morning, Telecity is moving forward in a good format and a good fashion. So I think we are very happy with what we see here, and all the planning is on a good path.","Do you guys have to add anything to that?","Charles Meyers","Well specifically to your question, there is no parallel review at a national level. The countries were provided an opportunity to object an EU review, forewent that objection and have now yielded to essentially the European Commission to do the review.","Steve Smith","Does that answer your question Jonathan?","Jonathan Atkin","Yes it does.","Steve Smith","On the first part. So on the M&A stuff; obviously, we have our eye on the M&A or on the consolidation activity going on in the industry. And as a team, I would tell you, that we are continuing to be very thoughtful about where we focus and how we create shareholder value and how we continue to expand our global leadership position. So we are going to remain, as I mentioned in my comments, very proactive, but highly selective on where we focus our attention. We are obviously well aware of the Telx transaction that was taking place. I won't make really any comments about that, other than to tell you that, our interest remain the same. We are going to try to scale this platform globally. We are going to try to deepen our interconnection and network density, as we look at M&A activity, and we are going to continue to try to capture the cloud and enterprise marketplace that we talk so much about.","So we will continue to -- we compete with both those entities around the edges, as you know. We will continue to compete on the basis of our own merits, and the value creation that we deliver to our customers. So I think we feel good about the platform we have in place. I would tell you that our belief internally is that the platform we have around the globe is very difficult to replicate. The degree of difficulty to replicate -- globally at an app scale level, consistent with the service delivery that we deliver around the world, with the services that we have, is extremely high. So we feel confident that we are well positioned to continue to compete, even with this combination.","Charles Meyers","Jonathan, I guess I'd add, you mentioned specifically to the fact that we are indeed a significant customer to both of those companies. And we would expect that to continue to be the case; because in fact, that represents the continued momentum of our business. In the case of DLR as a landlord, we have secured very long term contracts to allow us to maintain strategic control of the assets that are critical to our future and to us, executing on our strategy, and in the case of Telx, in order for us to prosecute our interconnection business, in some instances, we are using them to provide some of the services in terms of the interconnection going through certain meeting rooms. And because of the momentum in our business, we are actually contributing to their interconnection because of that momentum.","And so, may that continue. We certainly like that. But in terms of the competitive threat of that and what the combination looks like, again I'd go back to Steve's comments, which is -- our customers are really continuing to respond to our value proposition, looking for global access to rich network connectivity which we believe we provide best in industry basis, diverse, secure, high performance, private connectivity to cloud service providers around the world, which we also provide. And then consistent scalable operations that that could respond to their rapidly changing requirements, something we have invested a boatload of money in, and that we have a lot of people around the world, ensuring that they can deal with excellence, day-after-day. So we feel good about our ability to compete effectively with the combination of any set of players in the industry.","Jonathan Atkin","Thank you. And then just a quick question on sales, you mentioned channel, and I wondered what portion of bookings this quarter compared to prior quarters came from indirect partners? And then on the direct side, can you give us an update on the sales headcount versus the prior quarter?","Charles Meyers","So we haven't really typically broken out the specific percentage of indirect channel bookings. But I will say that it is on the rise. And in particular, our reseller community, with whom we are engaging in sort of sell-with motions. The market is still somewhat immature, I mean that's the realty. The enterprise market are still looking for solutions to their adoption of hybrid cloud, and that means, they typically engage with us and with partners to deliver a more complete solution, and we are seeing really good success with our key resale partners. So that's where the real momentum is in our channel efforts.","As it relates to the direct side, about 220 quota-bearing heads worldwide, we will look to probably increase that on the margin where we are seeing success in certain markets, and that is true in all three regions. So in fact, I just recently reviewed with each of our regional Presidents, their plans as it relates to adding sales headcount, in response to market conditions. And all of them, in a quite disciplined fashion are looking to do that, where we believe we have sort of latent demand that we can capture in the market.","So that won't be a huge number. But we think that given the momentum we have in the market, we would continue to add. But we are at 220, and I would expect another -- maybe perhaps 20 or 30 heads to come in over the next several quarters, based on continued momentum.","Jonathan Atkin","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is coming from Mr. Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore ISI. Sir, you may begin with your question.","Jonathan Schildkraut","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question guys. So listen, I guess I have one question about the guidance and then just one question about sort of where the stock is. So on the AFFO side, you guys have done about $440 million, a little north of that through the first half of the year, and the guide for the full year, implies obviously, a deceleration in the back part of the year. Just looking at sort of where your EBITDA guidance is, it shows sort of steady progression as we go through the course of the year. So I'd just like to get a sense as to what's happening from the EBITDA down the AFFO line from a translation perspective, that wouldn't have sort of the same similar growth pattern?","And then, I will come back for a second. Thanks.","Keith Taylor","Jonathan, I think it pertains to the biggest change. If I give you a bridge of the operational performance -- if I look at AFFO and give you a bridge of the operational performance, we'd say look, we are improving and yes this will continue through the remaining part of the year. But offsetting that are two things, number one, and the biggest thing is really interest expense, and part of that interest expense is attached to basically the $7 million for the commitment fee that we are paying on the bridge fee for the Telecity acquisition.","Part of it is, when we actually -- when we put in more capital and capital leases that we are taking from operating to capital, we have some impact there. When we take large projects, liked we had -- we had the big five projects in Q1 that went live, and that was, as you recall, Singapore 3, Melbourne 1, Toronto 2, and New York 6 and London 6. Interest that was otherwise capitalized in those transactions now also moves into, if you will, the operating line and that affects AFFO. But principally speaking, we continue to see continued momentum in our ability to drive up the EBITDA, and generally speaking, AFFO will translate with that or a period of time. But there are some anomalies that are taking place over the latter half of the year, primarily because of our construction activity and the acquisition.","Jonathan Schildkraut","Okay, great. So look, since the last time we got on a call, you guys have gotten a PLR, which I think everybody was pretty excited about. And earlier in the year, there was a lot of progress on index inclusion. The RMZ is still out there. I think the last time we spoke, you guys were still looking for your GICS code to get changed. Maybe could you take us up to date as to where that process is and how we might think about new index inclusion through year end, that'd be helpful? Thanks.","Steve Smith","Sure Jonathan, this is Steve. I will give you just a quick update. As you know, we were added to the FTSE NAREIT index which happened pretty quickly, I think it was March timeframe. The GICS code did change in June of 2015. We are now in the specialized REIT sector, and they do quarterly reviews, and I think the selection timeframe, Katrina and Paul are working hard on that, but I am not sure when we are clear on when -- which quarterly review will be considered. And then also, the team is staring at the iShares Dow Jones REIT index. We have made initial contact, but have somewhat limited visibility in terms of how that's going to proceed.","So those are the three activities we have had going on. They do, do quarterly reviews, and we have been tracking that and we will track that pretty closely.","Jonathan Schildkraut","All right. Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Next question is coming from Mr. Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Sir your line is open.","Simon Flannery","Thank you very much. Steve, you talked about the industry M&A going on and that you would be selective. So perhaps you can just expand on that comments? I think most of your expansions, have been, as you have said, campus builds in existing metros. Obviously Telecity gets you some new markets in Europe. But are you looking -- give us some color? Are you looking to perhaps get into new markets in Asia or other locations? And then, it's nice to see the acceleration up to that 15% level. I think in the past you have talked about a TAM that's sort of growing high single, low double digits. Is your share gain accelerating, or do you think the growth rate of the TAM has also picked up? Thanks.","Steve Smith","Sure. Let me start Simon, and then Keith and Charles can chime in here. But on the M&A color, as I mentioned to the previous question earlier here, I think from David; our focus on M&A activity is active. We have an active gain board. We have three heavy filters that we tend to put any regional input through, which is scale to platform. And we enhance our interconnection and network density secondly. And then thirdly, can we do something that will accelerate our capture of cloud and enterprises that come in and connect to the cloud.","We put most of the deal flow through those three lenses, and if you go back and look at our 2010 or 2011 acquisitions, we can point to some combination of those three things.","We are, I would tell you most of the activity is outside of North America. Latin America, as I have mentioned to you guys in the past, is of interest, to continue to expand the platform beyond Brazil, when and if the opportunities exist. In Asia, we are continuing to look at going deeper into China. We are working very hard in that market, to try to expand beyond our footprint in Shanghai, and that's of high importance to us.","India, will remain on the radar scale for us, but India, to find the right partner and the right partner has proved challenging. But across other parts of Asia, there are opportunities. And then in Europe, I think the Telecity activity is going to consumers, as you might imagine. It would put is six-seven new markets and strengthen our footprint in existing markets. So that's kind of where our focus is today. And I think someday you are going to see us show up and probably to start in South Africa, as we head to that part of the world, and there will be opportunities there that might broaden our reach in that part of the world.","As far as the TAM is considered, Charles, do you want to talk about the TAM?","Charles Meyers","Yeah. I think obviously, we are encouraged and delighted with the acceleration in the business and sort of achieving that 15% growth rate is something we feel very good about. We do think that that reflects a combination of factors, that include us continuing to gain share. But obviously when you think about TAM, its always a matter of how you're defining it. And I think what we would say is that, the TAM for a portion of the market, we believe is particularly relevant to us, where our value proposition is strongest, is indeed accelerating. And we think that's accelerating, due to the fact that enterprises are in fact adopting hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. And so as we look at offers of network -- of our performance sub-solution, cloud exchange, being able to really enable and empower companies to do these hybrid cloud kind of architectures and implement them, inclusive about the professional services required to get them there. We believe that market is indeed the total addressable market there is indeed accelerating, but we also think we are capturing additional shares.","So its probably a combination of those things. I would say that, when we said that the macro market was sort of low -- high single low double digits, I think that we are seeing -- I think, above that in terms of targeted markets around this enterprise IT transformation and cloud adoption. But we also I think are getting more than our fair share of that. So I think we continue to overperform, relative to the market and expect that that will continue in the future.","Simon Flannery","Correct. Thank you.","Operator","Next one is coming from Mr. Colby Synesael from Cowen & Co. Sir, you may begin.","Colby Synesael","Great, thank you. Two questions if I may; one is, I was hoping if you could update on your Business Suites strategy, how many markets you are in with that product now, perhaps the percentage of revenue that's being driven off of that? What customer has been? And then the second question is, I guess more housekeeping and tied to the model, can you just tell us what share count we should be using for 2015 AFFO per share, when we are putting that into our model? Thanks.","Charles Meyers","Why don't I take the first one and then obviously kick the second one back to Keith. Colby, as you know, Business Suites are something that we responded to an evolving market demand in terms of people looking to implement multi-tiered architectures. And as they --that continues to be a phenomenon that we see. As you know, we have continued to have a very strong discipline around right customer, right application and the right assets. And frankly, it is that discipline that's driving the pricing behavior that Keith talked about earlier, and driving the churn dynamics that we are seeing, which is improvements in both of those areas.","But as it relates to business suites, we have seen some success in that. It's really in a small number of markets. We have really implemented our product like that essentially in Ashburn and in New York. And even in those markets, we are evolving it based on our updated understanding of the customer's requirements. And so, what we are finding is, is that we are now implementing a more complete hybrid cloud solution, that often looks like a performance hub implementation, which is a smaller implementation, more network dense, more rich in connectivity to other clouds. But often paired with, a slightly larger implementation that maybe an adjacent site or in a different metro, that allows them to put certain applications there, that allow them to really fully implement hybrid cloud.","So we are evolving it a bit. We continue to build out sites that we think can support that sort of multi-tiered architecture. You will see upcoming announcements from us, relative to how our product set is evolving to meet that demand. And we feel very good about what we are doing, to really support the complete need of the enterprise customer.","Keith Taylor","Colby on your second question, I am going to refer you to two slides. On slide 14, we give an appropriate bridge of our AFFO and consistent with my comments that I made to Jonathan earlier, you can see how AFFO plays itself out for fiscal year 2015. Technically, FFO is going to run at the same rate, with increased AFFO at effectively the same rate as increased EBITDA for the remaining part of the year.","As it relates to share count, I refer you to page 33, which gives you a fully dilutive weighted average share forecast. And we give it to you in all sort of shapes and sizes, so that you can look at it, based on what your needs are from an actual number to a weighted average number to a fully diluted number. So I think that will be a good representation for you to use, and [indiscernible] there is any follow-up questions, happy to take that, or Katrina and Paul will be happy to talk to you about it as well. But page 33 is a pretty detailed analysis of our diluted share position.","Colby Synesael","So it looks like then, I should be using the 59 and I guess what, in change for the full year?","Keith Taylor","Yeah, 59 if you are going to -- when you look at a fully dilutive basis with the convertible notes. If you want to look at it differently, those notes will convert in 2016, but you want to think a little bit about what might happen with the special distribution, which is theoretically -- probably a Q4 event for us. You are in the 59 million to 60 million shares zip code.","Colby Synesael","Okay. Thank you.","Keith Taylor","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our last question is coming from Mr. Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Sir, you may begin with your question.","Mike McCormack","Hey guys, thanks. Maybe just a quick comment on the Asia-Pac MRR per cabinet. I know Keith, I think you said you had some pretty large cloud deployments. How should we think about that as it goes through the back half of the year? Do you expect more big clouds coming in there, that would continue to weight on that? And then maybe, just a broader question on REIT investors and sort of your recent conversations, their appetite and interest in the company?","Keith Taylor","Well I think Mike, just to address the first question, again the Asia-Pac region, we can see by the level of growth that they have experienced, both on a as-reported and on an FX neutral basis, has been quite substantial. And as a result, you have also seen the amount of activity that they are actually selling into, into the IBXes. So any time you have that type of growth with that type of volume going through the system, it takes time if you will, for the interconnection and the other services to catch up. So that's one aspect of it.","The second aspect of course, we do -- we have been very-very successful in Singapore with our cloud deployment, and because of that, you tend to -- it comes in size, and when it comes in size, it generally comes at a different price point. And so that also was a little bit dilutive for the overall method, and then of course currency is equally causing some fluctuation.","So overall, we are pleased with what we see in Asia-Pacific. We are not surprised by the price points we are at. And going forward, depending on the momentum, I would tell you that we would expect firmness across the board, whether it's Asia or the other regions on average yield per cabinet.","And I am sorry, I have lost track of the second question, on the REIT investors?","Mike McCormack","Yeah just sort of the upside and the recent feedback you have been getting?","Keith Taylor","Overall, look its no surprise to you that we are meeting with a number of investors. Katrina and Paul do a good job of looking out for those type of investors who have taken a broad interest in basically our story. We think it\u2019s a very compelling story, as we have said before. We are going to mix yield, with basically a faster growing company, and that's evidenced by our results posted today and our forecast for the rest of the year. We could think we can deliver a total shareholder return to all our investors, but particularly those reinvestors who like our story in a very meaningful way.","So from our perspective, we will continue to focus on them. We are gaining momentum. We certainly have interest in our story, and we spend a lot of energy talking with those investors.","Mike McCormack","Great. Thanks guys.","Keith Taylor","Great.

If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Katrina Rymill, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Katrina Rymill","Good afternoon. Welcome to today's conference call. Before I get started, I'd like to remind everyone that some of the statements I'll be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2013 and our most recent 10-Q filed on November 12, 2013.","Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition, in light of Regulation Fair Disclosure, it is Equinix's policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","In addition, we will provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call.

Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call to an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-up questions to just one.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Before we walk through the results of the quarter, we'd like to take a minute to reflect on the milestones we've achieved in 2013. For the first time, we delivered over 2 billion of revenue and over 1 billion of adjusted EBITDA demonstrating the strength of our business model.","Second, the scale of platform Equinix with 100 data centers and 32 metros around the world now supports approximately 4,500 customers who are connecting to their customers and partners to accelerate business performance. As part of growing the global platform, we completed 18 IBX expansions including moving into new markets in Osaka, Dubai and Jakarta.","Third, we delivered 175 million of adjusted free cash flow after full funding our growth capital expenditures. This provides us flexibility with our balance sheet and allows for shareholder friendly actions such as the share repurchase program announced last quarter.","We also continued to progress with our plans to convert to a REIT on January 1, 2015 and are making investments in our systems and people and preparation for this conversion.","Finally, interconnection revenue outpaced overall revenue growing 18% due to the vibrancy of the business ecosystems operating inside our data centers. We added 14,000 cross connects in 2013 finishing the year with over 128,000 connections among our customers and partners.","We continue to benefit from bandwidth demand as evidenced by over 20% growth and traffic in our exchanges which we operate in 19 markets across the globe. As we enter 2014 we see continued strength in the business and are well positioned to execute on emerging growth opportunities.","While we continue to manage through selective headwinds related to movement of certain applications to multitiered architectures, targeted price concessions on key renewals to move customers to longer term contracts and some uncertainty about the timing and pace of enterprises migrating to hybrid cloud solutions, we remain committed to balancing growth and profitability by putting the right customers with the right applications into the right locations.","We believe our strategy will meaningfully differentiate the performance of Equinix versus the broader market and the success of this strategy is clearly reflected in our quarterly business results, which includes solid growth, healthy operating margins and firm yield per cabinet.","We continue to put in place the building blocks to position Equinix as the interconnection platform for the world's leading businesses. Foundationally, we are increasing our network density as a central source of value for our customers across all verticals. In 2013 we added over 75 new carriers globally including new connectivity options in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, driven by our ancotel acquisition and Dubai investment.","Platform Equinix now provides access to more than 975 network service providers making us the clear choice for exchanging traffic cost effectively, securely and with superior performance. This breadth of choice in networks allows us to attract magnet customers that turns all their customers to create dynamic ecosystems which generate increasing returns for both Equinix and our customers.","This ecosystem effect allows us to deliver solid results even through times of volatility and uncertainty. For example, despite a challenging year for the global financial services sector in 2013, our business in this protocol grew steadily. Today, we announced that BATS, one of the world's most advanced trading platforms and one of the largest operators of U.S. equity markets has elected to consolidate its U.S. markets to better serve its customers and has chosen Equinix as the primary data center provider for all existing BATS exchanges.","With the completion of the BATS merger with Direct Edge, BATS selected Equinix based on a variety of factors including the quality of our facilities and the strength of our financial ecosystem. This is a critical addition to their over 150 exchange and execution platform deployments that currently reside within Equinix and as the only data center provider with a presence across top global financial markets, we expect to realize outside benefits as these markets return to growth.","Similarly, in our content digital media business, despite large content providers moving to multitiered architectures, we remain confident about our market position and we are optimistic about the potential in untapped market segments in this protocol. For example, there is growth in a number of customers implementing do-it-yourself CDMs and then digital advertising, both of which are sweet spot applications characterized by small to midsized footprints with high power density, rich interconnection and correspondently high yield per cabinet.","Our recent successes include global deployment with RadiumOne, MediaMath, Casale Media and are indicative of our continued momentum in this segment and growth of the Ad-IX ecosystem. For 2014, a significant part of our strategy and the primary emphasis of our innovation investment is aimed at capturing the longer term opportunity associated with cloud computing. Cloud is creating massive disruptions in the IT supply chain and will continue to do so in an accelerated pace, bearing opportunities across all of our verticals.","CIOs and leading influencers like Gartner continue to point to hybrid cloud as the long-term architecture of choice and highlight carrier neutral data center selection as critical to unlocking the potential of the cloud. We have achieved significant momentum with cloud service providers who see our network density, global reach and mission critical reliability as fundamental to their success.","Cloud and IT services grew 16% year-over-year and led all segments in multi-region deployments. We ended 2013 with over 1,200 cloud and IT service customers with 42% of this revenue from the infrastructure as a service and software as a service segment. Often the early adopters of hybrid cloud solutions are cloud-related businesses themselves. For example, a social networking company Foursquare has built a private and hybrid cloud deployment inside Equinix to reduce costs and improve performance for its big data analytics platform.","As Slide 4 shows, by moving from public to hybrid cloud, Foursquare has been able to double the number of transactions processed while keeping its cost flat. By leveraging direct connection to AWS inside Equinix, Foursquare also substantially increased performance transferring data five times faster than public network connections could support.","Networks are also expanding their ability to connect their customers privately to cloud services inside Equinix. Recently, Verizon extended its private IT service with Equinix and AT&T deployed its NetBond cloud access product across select Equinix data centers to adjust the security and performance challenges faced by enterprisers.","Private access to cloud services will emerge as a business priority for enterprise CIOs and represents a major revenue opportunity for carriers. In addition to service providers, we are seeing the front edge of enterprise deployments where companies such as McGraw-Hill come to Equinix to deploy hybrid cloud in order to leverage the ability to directly connect to key cloud service providers such as AWS, Microsoft, Azure and software which is now part of IBM.","The enterprise market continued to represent a significant opportunity for Equinix and while growth in this segment fell short of our aspirations in 2013, we won important deployments from leading enterprises and these case studies will equip our sales team to a broader penetration going forward. Indicative of our momentum, 18 of the top 25 information technology outsourcing firms and 4 of the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies are now deploying with Equinix.","To ensure continued growth, we are targeting specific industries which we feel are a match with the value of our global interconnected platform including business and professional services, health care and energy oil and gas and these efforts are resulting in early traction.","We are also developing enterprise-ready solutions to leverage our core products and services. For example, our performance hub solution which is an enterprise private network node deployed at Equinix in order to flexibly extend the enterprise win to optimize network costs, securely access to cloud and improve the performance of key applications.","Through partners we offer consulting services, hardware procurement and carrier selection to help an enterprise design and implement a network architecture that includes performance hubs. Wins for this solution include Chevron, eBay and Nvidia and also a large information technology outsourcer who has elected to deploy performance hubs across three markets and two regions initially to plan for significant global expansion. We are confident that 2014 will represent another year of solid growth and attractive profitability and will position us to exploit key opportunities.","Now, let me turn the call over the Keith to cover some of the results for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor","Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. So for this call what I'd like to do first is provide you some highlights for the full year of 2013 and then I'll provide you some additional detail on the fourth quarter.","So starting with 2013, we delivered 2.153 billion of revenue representing a 14% year-over-year growth and up 13% when normalized for acquisitions and constant currency. On a regional basis, both our EMEA and Asia Pacific regions delivered strong year-over-year growth at 21% and 20%, respectively, while the Americas region produced solid growth of 10% on this meaningfully larger base.","Our operating margins continued to improve particularly after adjusting for weak-related cash costs. We see a clear path to targeted adjusted EBITDA margin of 50% which will be achieved through increasing cash flow margins, operational efficiencies derived from our systems work and our underlying expectation that we'll leverage our investments in the SG&A base.","Also, similar to the comment made by Steve, I want to highlight the fact that we have eclipsed the $1 billion adjusted EBITDA mark for 2013, a great accomplishment for our company. Our key metrics across the board remain healthy this year including new customer additions, attractive average yield sizes, multi-metro deployments, yield per cabinet and a number of interconnections both on the cross connect and the port level. In fact, interconnection revenues increased by 18% over the prior year primarily due to growth in each of our regions with particular strength in the Americas and EMEA region.","Turning to Slide 5, I'd like to highlight how we invested in the business in 2013. We generated approximately 632 million in cash from operations for the year and reinvested 572 million with consistently high levels of return. We also acquired two strategic assets, Kleyer 90 in Frankfurt where our ancotel business resides and our New York 2 IBX which is a critical part of our financial services ecosystem. We now have over 10 million gross square feet of space which is the largest retail data center footprint in the world.","Ongoing CapEx was higher than expected at 183 million for the year, which included success-based installations, maintenance and value enhancing initiatives such as the global IT initiative. Finally, we repurchased 49 million of Equinix stock in 2013 and through the date of this call, we've increased this investment to greater than 92 million.","Now turning to Slide 6, I'll review our fourth quarter results. We delivered a very solid fourth quarter against our revenue and adjusted EBITDA objectives. Global Q4 revenues increased to 564.7 million, a 4% increase over the prior quarter and up 12% over the same quarter last year both on a normalized and constant currency basis.","Our Q4 revenue performance reflects a $5.4 million positive currency benefit when compared to the average rates used in Q3 and a $500,000 negative headwind when compared to our guidance rates. Total cash gross profit to the quarter was 390.4 million, up 6% over the prior quarter and up 12% over the same quarter last year, largely due to lower than expected rent and utilities expense. Cash gross margins were 69% of revenues.","Total cash SG&A expenses increased to 126.9 million for the quarter including approximately $7 million of REIT-related cash costs. Global adjusted EBITDA increased to 263.5 million above the top end of our guidance range and 11% increase over the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%.","Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance reflects a positive $2.3 million currency benefit when compared to the average rates used in Q3 at a $200,000 negative impact when compared to our FX guidance range. ","Global net income attributable to Equinix was 45.2 million, up 6% quarter-over-quarter. Our fully diluted earnings per share was $0.88. For the year our reported net income attributable to Equinix was 94.7 million or $1.87 per diluted share.","Absent the loss in the debt extinguishment primarily attributed to the early prepayment of our 2018 high yield notes, our pro forma net income would have been 159.2 million or $3.10 per diluted share, effectively a 20% increase over the prior year.","MRR churn was consistent with our expectations at 2.3%. For the full year of 2014, we expect MRR churn to average approximately 2.5% per quarter with the exception of Q2 whereby we expect to experience slightly elevated churn related to LinkedIn as they bifurcate a portion of their infrastructure. This MRR churn is being fully contemplated in our 2014 guidance.","We continue to expect steady MRR for cabinet deals across each of our regions this year, foreign currency aside. As a reminder, MRR for cabinet metric is a constant calculation of our space, our power, interconnection and other return revenues divided by the average billing cabinets in the quarter.","We remain focused on increasing the level of interconnection activity densing up the amount of prior consumers by our customers and realizing price escalators in our contracts as this gives us the flexibility to absorb price adjustments with certain of our customers as we respond to market conditions and as we seek to extend the term of their contracts. We've accomplished this value creating objective while increasing the overall profitability of our business, which we believe is good for our shareholders.","Now moving on to comments on REIT. We continue to move forward with our plans to convert to a REIT starting on January 1, 2015. And while we're still awaiting the response from the IRS on our PLR request, we currently do not expect delays in this timeframe.","On Slide 7 we summarize the various expected REIT-related cash cost and taxes similar to our discussion last quarter. Of note, as we continue to progress with our REIT conversion effort we are updating our one-time implementation costs to now range between $75 million and $85 million through 2014.","For the full year of 2014 we expect to incur approximately $37 million of cash costs and $16 million of capital expenditures for the REIT conversion. In the first quarter, we expect to incur approximately 11 million in REIT-related cash costs.","With respect to income taxes, we have paid approximately 124 in cash taxes, lower than our prior range primarily due to some incremental tax planning efforts over the past few quarters. Looking at 2014 our estimated cash tax liability is expected to range to between 145 million and 180 million, including approximately 35 million in non-REIT related cash tax costs.","Our U.S. tax liability related to D&A recaptured continue to range between 360 million and 380 million, of which 193 million has either been settled through the use of our prior NOLs or cash taxes paid to-date.","Turning to Slide 8, I'd like to start reviewing the regional results beginning with the Americas. The Americas region delivered a strong quarter on both the revenue and adjusted EBITDA lines, meeting or beating expectations across many of their key metrics as well as exporting a significant amount of activity to the other two regions.","Americas revenues was 326.1 million, a 2% increase over the prior quarter and up 10% over the same quarter last year. Cash gross margins increased nicely to 73%, the result of lower rent, utility and salaries and benefits expense. Adjusted EBITDA was 159.6 million, up 6% over the prior quarter. Americas adjusted EBITDA margin was 49% for the quarter which includes the absorption of corporate functions.","Americas net billing cabinets increased by approximately 800 in the quarter while MRR per cabinet remains steady at very attractive levels. Americas added 1,500 net cross connects in the quarter and interconnection revenues as a percent of the region's recurring revenues remained at 20%.","Finally, we'll commence work on the second phase of our Philadelphia-1 IBX and carrier against asset with over 50 networks at a strong yield for cabinets in order to support the supply constrained market.","Now looking at EMEA, please turn to Slide 9. EMEA revenues were 144.8 million, up 9% sequentially and reflects strong performance across a number of the numbers with particular emphasis on the UK and Netherlands. Additionally, the ability for the global organization to sell platform Equinix into the key EMEA market continues to be a vector of above market growth in this region.","Revenues on a normalized and cost and currency basis were up 4% quarter-over-quarter and up 18% year-over-year, making Equinix Europe the market leader in the region. Adjusted EBITDA was 59.6 million, up 4% over the prior quarter and up 31% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 41% largely due to higher rent, salaries and benefits and bad debt expenses. Normalized and on a cost and currency basis, EMEA adjusted EBITDA increased by 1% over the prior quarter and 26% compared to the same quarter last year.","EMEA interconnection revenues increased 13% over the prior quarter and up 31% over the same quarter last year. In the quarter 1,400 net cross connects were added. Interconnection revenues as a percent of the regions recurring revenues increased to 8% demonstrating continued progress of growing the interconnection line in our European assets.","MRR per cabinet remains firm across the EMEA market and net cabinet billing increased by approximately 500. Additionally, we completed the London-4 and 5 transaction for 37 million and entered into long-term ground leases on London-4, 5 and the future London-6 property, effectively giving Equinix 50 years of control of our Slough campus.","Now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to Slide 10. Asia Pacific again had record bookings this quarter with particular strength in our Singapore end market. Asia Pacific revenues were 93.8 million, a 4% increase over the prior quarter. Similar to the EMEA region, Asia Pacific is a beneficiary of Platform Equinix. Revenues on a normalized and a cost and currency basis were up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 12% year-over-year.","Adjusted EBITDA was 44.3 million, up 8% over the last quarter and down 2% compared to the same quarter last year due to expansion activity in Osaka and Melbourne. MRR per cabinet remains strong despite the FX headwinds from both the Australian dollar and Japanese yen over the past few quarters. Cabinets billing increased by 600 compared to prior quarter and we added 1,300 net cross connects. In fact, the revenue is now 12% of the region's recurring revenues.","In Asia Pacific we continue to target multinational customers for this region. As previously announced, we intend to expand into the Melbourne market and have opened our first Osaka IBX in Q4, bringing the total market served in regions to 7. This will allow those customers that have specific interest in the network, financial services and client verticals to expand with us in these new markets. The Melbourne IBX will be our fourth IBX in the Australian market providing us a two market presence across Australia's two biggest cities.","Now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to Slide 11. We ended the quarter with 1.03 billion of unrestricted cash and investments on our balance sheet and our current liquidity position continues to remain healthy. Our net debt leverage ratio remains at 3 times our Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Over the past few quarters, we've increased the number of leases that are now treated by the capital leases are build to suit arrangements in both cases increasing the level of leverage on our balance sheet.","In the quarter, we increased our capital lease and other financing obligations by 52 million, increased the amount of debt outstanding in ALOG [ph] to 68 million and assume that $43 million related to the Frankfurt-5 building acquisition.","Switching to Slide 12, our Q4 operating cash flow decreased over the prior quarter to 166.7 million, primarily due to an increase in cash, interest paid on our outstanding debt, large cash tax payments in Q4. Our DSOs decreased to 29 days.","For 2013, adjusted discretionary free cash flow was 558 million, lower than expected largely due to higher than the expected ongoing capital expending and increased working capital requirements. For 2014 we expect our adjusted discretionary free cash flow excluding any REIT-related cash cost or taxes to range between 620 million and 650 million, and adjusted free cash flow to be greater than 200 million.","Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to Slide 13. For the quarter capital expenditures were 203 million including ongoing capital expenditures of 68 million. We opened five new phases in the quarter including the first phase attributed to our new build in Osaka, the third phase of our Ashburn business REIT product and the final phase of our London-5 asset.","We now currently have 11 announced expansion projects underway across the globe of which 10 are CapEx builds from our incremental phase build. And as you know, this helps to derisk the investment given the current customer pipeline and typically it was often reduced investment on these incremental phases over their initial phase.","At this point, let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Okay. Thanks, Keith. Let me now shift gears and cover our 2014 strategy and outlook on Slide 14. Our corporate initiatives are aligned at three strategic priorities designed to further differentiate our global data center services. First, we will continue to drive differentiated growth by deepening our existing ecosystem, exceeding new ones with a focus on cloud. We are making significant investments and innovations to prepare platform Equinix becomes a home for enterprises, connecting to public, private and hybrid cloud deployment.","While adoption is ramping up at a rate that is exceeding any other industry vertical and delivered record bookings every quarter in 2013, while we are in the early innings of this paradigm shift to cloud computing, we believe that latency and interconnection will become increasingly important as critical applications move to the cloud. Our investment is squarely aimed at winning network assess in service aggregation nodes and leveraging the next generation of interconnection to help solve key issues for the enterprise including security, performance and reliability bottlenecks.","Additionally, we continue to focus on increasing organizational effectiveness by driving global consistency, alignment and focus. We have several initiatives targeted at improving our ability to design, build, operate, market, sell and support our global platform. Throughout 2013 we have added leadership to our sales, technology and HR team as well as a new President of our Americas business. This will allow Charles Meyers to now fully focus on the Chief Operating role to drive global alignment and consistency with sales, marketing and IBX operations. This additional leadership will become an integral part of how we execute our growth and cost productivity initiatives in 2014 and beyond.","A key part of improving organizational effectiveness is our Equinix Customer One program that will simplify, standardize and automate our quote to cash processes on a worldwide basis. This will significantly improve our customer experience, particularly the base that customers are operating in multiple regions around the world and accelerate acquisition of new customers.","Finally, we will continue to refine our capital allocation strategy by balancing growth with return on invested capital and free cash flow. Our priorities for deployment of capital remain focused on driving top line profitable growth through organic and inorganic investment. In addition, we are executing against our commitment to become a REIT and showing that we have sufficient funding to meet our requirements under the REIT structure including distributions to shareholders and the REIT conversion costs.","Lastly, our cover our outlook for 2014 on Slide 15 and 16. For the first quarter of 2014, we expect revenues to be in the range of 572 million to 576 million. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between 133 million and 137 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between 256 million and 260 million, which includes 11 million in costs related to the REIT conversion.","Capital expenditures are expected to be 130 million to 140 million, including 60 million of ongoing capital expenditures. For the full year of 2014, we expect revenue to be greater than 2.38 billion or 11% year-over-year growth, which absorbs 12 million of negative foreign currency headwinds compared to our Q4 guidance range.","Full year cash gross margins are expected to be approximately 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to range between 530 million and 550 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be greater than 1.1 billion which absorbs 5 million of negative foreign currency headwinds compared to our Q4 guidance rate and also includes 37 million in costs related to our REIT conversion efforts. We expect 2014 capital expenditures to range between 550 million and 650 million, including approximately 200 million of ongoing capital expenditures.","For 2014 we expect 90% of expansion capital expenditures will be for campus and existing market builds and 10% for new market development. For all IBX builds, Equinix's existing customer fill rate analysis gives us strong visibility into a market demand, pricing and returns.","So in closing, this is a time of significant opportunity for our company. The infrastructure underlines the global digital economy continues to undergo a significant transformation and our market leadership gives us a unique perspective and a critical role in this transformation. We continue to build a world class organization and our committed to delivering distinctive value and a consistently superior global experience for our customers.","Our highly differentiated platform and the strength of the digital ecosystems that we guide in our facilities allow us to deliver strong current levels of performance and fund meaningful investments in transformation opportunity like cloud that will heal our continued growth and profitability. We are proud of what we've achieved to date and look forward to an exciting road ahead.","So let me stop here and open it up for questions, so over to you, Jerry.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut, Evercore Partners. Your line is open.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc.","Thank you for taking the questions. So, I guess my first question really is about the competitive environment and I was wondering if you could give us an update on sort of the landscape, particularly in the U.S. of the competitors and really maybe compare it to where we were a year ago, let us know if anything has really evolved? And then I also have a question on the guidance. As I look at the guidance for the year, it looks like the incremental margins as we go from the first quarter to the second, third and fourth were pretty high, better than we've seen I guess over the last several quarters and wondering if there is something to understand behind that?","Stephen M. Smith","Jonathan, why don't I take the second question first and then I'll let Charles answer your question. I think first of all, when you look at the guidance, certainly if you go to Q1, we're giving you a sense \u2013 a little bit of a bridge of what's going on. Clearly, there's incremental REIT costs that are taking place in Q1. In fact of the 37 million that we were highlighting as incremental investment to REIT for 2014, 11 million we believe will occur in the first quarter. In addition, as you know, if I take the FICA costs \u2013 if I take FICA plus all the other cost that has happened in Q1 relative to Q4, there's roughly an $8 million uplift although I'm showing $4 million in this slide. That said, if I average it out over the year, it's roughly \u2013 you should expect FICA to be relatively stable. But because of how it gets weighted, there's roughly an $8 million uplift versus Q4. And then the other thing is there's always a lot of frontloading of costs. We have our annual sales kickoff in the first quarter of the year. So by the time we get the backend of the year, you start to see some of those costs come off. And the other thing I would just add is when you get to Europe, we have a higher seasonal utility rates in Europe in the winter months whereas for us in America, we pay high utility rates in the summer months. And so there's a little bit of SKU there. And for all those reasons, sometimes it doesn't quite sort of cauterize as you might expect but we'll talk to all of these things and we feel this is the level of EBITDA we can deliver this year. So let me just knock on one last thing I wanted to say. Certainly when you look at our EBITDA growth and we said if we think we can use greater than 1.1 billion of EBITDA this year, if you that $37 million of REIT costs this year, $21 million of REIT costs last year, basically what we're saying is we're going to have roughly 30 basis points of margin despite all of the other investments that we're going to make and we'll certainly be talking about that through this call, including cloud go-to-market and in the sales organization. So I hope that answers your second question. Let me push it to the first question.","Charles J. Meyers","Jonathan, it's Charles. I'm happy to take that. Significantly as it relates to U.S., I would say that the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the last 12 months as we've probably seen some moderation of excess supply concerns in some markets. I think we continue to gain from market share in the retail game and they continue to be very disciplined about our execution. I would say that I think that the level of price competition on less differentiated application tests whether those be large footprints that are potentially well served by wholesalers or whether those be smaller footprints but less differentiated application type, the price competition there I think does continue to be out there and I think that just makes it more \u2013 even more critical for us to maintain our disciplined execution and to really hone ourselves in marketing focus and investments around application types where we really deliver unique value and that's our focus. And I think what we're really doing in the market and I think that's paying dividends, I think as the results show.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc.","Thanks, Charles. You in the past have talked about sales force productivity and having moved away from the large footprint space, it really puts more pressure to get the executions up. Is there any update there on the sales side?","Charles J. Meyers","Yes, again, that definitely is true. I think that without some of the lift that maybe in prior years existed from some of the larger footprints. We are still seeing, by the way, some success. As we talk about it there are certain large footprint deal types that we continue to be very well positioned for and interestingly in Q4, we actually had a strong quarter relative to some very attractive well priced large footprint, ecosystem type deals. But it is harder in terms of just delivering more unit volume and more transactions in short to the sweet spot in small to mid-sized deals that is a harder sales execution problem. So, it depends. Productivity varies across our verticals to some degree. We see strength and continued solid performance in network. Financial, we're actually excited about the prospects for some fresh momentum created by the BATS announcement which you saw today. Cloud continues to grow nicely as we talked about in the script. And then enterprise sales cycles continue to be protracted and that's going to take us some time to really own our marketing skill set in that arena and get the offers to a point where they are really gaining traction more rapidly in the market. So, overall, I think that the situation is kind of in line with what we expected but making good progress.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc.","Thank you for taking the questions.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Rollins, Citi Investment Research. Your line is open.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Was wondering if you could talk a little bit more on pricing? When you mentioned that you're looking for a steady yield, can you just talk a little bit more \u2013 I know you mentioned a little bit how you're trying to differentiate between an MRR or ARPU type calculation versus the pricing on a per unit of whether it's space, or power or interconnection and maybe if you could give us a little bit more feel not just in the totality for the company but maybe by region would be very helpful? Thanks. ","Charles J. Meyers","Sure. Let me take that part and maybe if Keith or Steve wants to add in on some of the other regional dynamics, they can do that. There are a variety of price related factors that we look at. Certainly what are new deal pricing, what are we seeing sort of per cabinet or per kilowatt basis, what is the pricing on key renewals? And again the most important one, because it's the underlying driver of our economics, is really yield and that is what kind of MRR per cabinet are we getting? And so that's really the focus. As I said, I think there are some pockets of pressure on new deal pricing relative to certainly the case on the larger deal sizes which we've talked about. And again, if we see price points that we don't believe generate adequate returns, we're just foregoing that business and remaining focused on sweet spot applications. But even in a broader market, even in small to mid-sized deals, there are pocket pressures and there's really a continuum of application size in terms of which ones really value the network density, application performance, latency, global reach, mission critical reliability, the things that we really differentiate ourselves on. And if we're finding the right applications as we're able to preserve and see a very firm price umbrella, there are deals that maybe only have one or two of those key factors in play, there is a little more pricing pressure in the market. But our focus is really on identifying the right applications, bringing the right mix of business into the facilities and then really focusing on interconnection \u2013 adding interconnection revenue, densing that power over time and driving the yield. So the yield is really the one that we're most focused on. And I think as you see across the three regions, we actually see firmness across all three. I think there is more currency impact in APAC on that metric, but as you can see we're at very healthy levels in the Americas and continue to be very encouraged by the fact that the strategy is playing out the way it is in those metrics.","Stephen M. Smith","Mike, I'll just add on a couple of things. Number one, as Charles alluded to, not only what he's seeing in Americas but across the world, leveling interconnection activity is starting to increase. And so when we think about how we drive value in this business, clearly we focus on MRR for cabinet. That's the yield that we get. But probably even more important as you start to think about cab densing and things like that, it's really important as you think about an IBX on the horizontal plane being the physical space and the vertical plane being actually the infrastructure. We're trying to get this up to consume more of our infrastructure because we tend to sell out more space before we do the infrastructure and if we get better unit performance, better return on invested capital as we dense up that environment and that plays also into our sort of desire and our quest to drive up the MRR for cabinet and dense up these facilities. It also gives us more flexibility as we negotiate with customers. And the other thing I certainly want to say is whether we deal with the Americas or whether it's Europe or for that matter it's Asia Pacific, across the board we deploy these same strategies. We also look at tiering of our IBXs in different markets, we have different tiered IBXs that come at different price points. And so we take all of that into consideration when we actually go to our pricing discussions not only in Germany but also with our customers.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc","Just one follow-up, how many sales people did you end the quarter with?","Keith D. Taylor","205 I think is the number today, Michael, and it will probably increase 6% to 9% on a full year basis, so we might add another 15 to the 20 throughout the calendar year.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brett Feldman, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG","Thanks. Maybe just to sort of extend on this discussion here as we sort of think about the outlook you provided for the year, you've talked about a focus on increasing the volume of cabinet additions. You've obviously increased the sales force. You're looking to increase it more. What's the right framework for thinking about the extent to which MRR trends factor into your outlook for the year versus say potentially improved cabinet addition trends? And is there meaningful differences in terms of how we think about that regionally?","Charles J. Meyers","Hi, Brett. It's Charles. I'll start and these guys can add in where appropriate. Obviously we're going to continue to work both of those factors simultaneously. So, I think we're honing our go to market and as I said our overall sales and marketing focus is to continue to capture new cabinet initiatives while also new logo customers in the application types where we are going to be able to garner value. And in doing so and in continuing to optimize our current footprint which means that occasionally turning out lower \u2013 less interconnected business or lower quality business for a higher quality business, we're going to continue to work those simultaneously. So, as you can see in our yields what we're seeing is that as we do that and as we continue to focus on the right types of business, we're seeing good results on the MRR per cab line. So, I think it's clearly the answer of both. I do think we want to continue to pick off the pace on our ability to capture new logos and new cabinets, but in the background if we put the right business in, we're going to get the backend effect of really improving our yield over time as well. And I think that's probably uniform across the footprint. Obviously the levels of interconnection in the U.S. are slightly higher, but I think we're very pleased with the progress in the other two regions relative to implementing and acting on it, executing the interconnection strategy. So, interconnection was really healthy in both the other regions in EMEA and APAC and are really coming up to a level in terms of percentage of revenue that's very attractive and that's obviously positively impacting margins.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG","Just a quick follow-up since you gave the sales force number, to Mike's question, the force has obviously increased significantly over the last few years. You've talked about a period of time for reps to ramp up to full quota. How do you feel about the sales generation of the sales force right now relative to its size and tenure?","Keith D. Taylor","Well, it matures as Charles said earlier by vertical. The ramp to productivity is it varies by vertical but in generally overall we're very happy. If you consider the significant upgrading and the size of the sales force a couple of years ago, most of those reps would be to reach full productivity or they've been washed out of the company and we've replaced. So, it's a constant measurement, it's a constant tracking and overall we're very happy. And as alluded to in the scripts here, the toughest sales force today is the elongated sales cycles with the enterprises, but I think as cloud develops and we get more proficient in our offer development or value propositioning and we get these used cases developed, we're going to start to see acceleration of enterprises coming out of Equinix.","Stephen M. Smith","I guess Brett one more quick follow-on comment and that is that we believe there's absolutely room to continue to improve the productivity of the force. One is, is that we are being more aggressive with our performance management, taking some underperformers out, swapping them out and as they mature, we expect that will create additional productivity. But also there's a bunch of other levers that we have to continue to pull to make the sales teams really productive in the field. One, improving our targeting. As I talked about we have them pointed at the right application sets, we're very uniquely differentiated. Second, we got to deliver the right offers that are directly responsive to the customers' business needs. Third, we need to use the right channels and that won't always be directed, it will be I think over time an augment of indirect to support our direct effort as well. And then reducing sales drag which we're focused on in a number of ways and then improving sales execution. We've added a couple of top notch executives in our CSO and our President of the Americas both of whom have backgrounds in driving productivity from sales teams. So believe that there is more room there. If we can stay focused on the right portions of the market, we can generate good results.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Atkin, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Maybe both questions for Keith actually, you mentioned 50% EBITDA margins and I wondered over what timeframe you think you can reach those levels? And then on CapEx, if I add up all the items in your tracking sheet, for IBXs that haven't yet opened, I get above the high-end of your guidance for discretionary CapEx and obviously some of those items are for first half '15 openings, but I just wanted to get a sense of the timing of the CapEx added in for a new expansion? Is that heavily backend weighted or evenly weighted? And why would the CapEx exceed your guidance?","Keith D. Taylor","Yes, I'll take both things. So first of all I'll start from an EBITDA perspective, again if you adjust for the REIT costs we're today at 48% EBITDA margin this year. By the time you get to backend of 2014, it's going to be a much higher EBITDA profile than the front half. And so as we move into '15 and some of these costs come off not only from the REIT conversion but also some of the costs related to our systems conversion, certainly we're going to get near or about that mark. So we're going to get a lot closer as we said for one more year out into the future. Don't want to commit to '15 but certainly things are going to start to look better in '15 as we continue to execute as we have been. And then as it relates to CapEx, it's just that clearly it's a matter of timing. They do tend to be backend loaded. There's a number of mid very large projects and certainly we have a big investment in the first quarter, but as we move through the year there's a number of projects where although we've announced, you're going to see the spend will actually get paid for in 2015. Again, as a reminder, Jonathan, we always report our CapEx on a cash basis, right. And so to the extent there was cash movements moving around, it's going to influence the outcome of that and we're going to continue to pay attention of that through this year. But I'll just tell you that some of the spend will take place in '15 for '14 projects.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets","And then perhaps for Charles or Steve on the interconnect side, there was a higher sequential increase in exchange ports in the U.S. and wondered if that was related to demand or pricing or maybe a combination? And then that might provide a segue to talk about Open IX which is based on a similar technology and kind of what you're seeing on that front and expecting?","Charles J. Meyers","Sure. Yes, I think we're encouraged by the momentum that we see on the exchange not only in terms of traffic growth but in terms of port additions. And I think it is a segue to talk about Open IX. We covered that somewhat on the last call but I'm happy to comment further. Bottom line is we've been in competition for IX in the form of transit and alternative exchanges for 10 plus years. We welcome the competition. We believe it's good for customers. As I said, anytime there's a new entry in new market, I think it's important to access whether that new entry is created by the existence of an unmet need or simply because the new (indiscernible) believes there's room for additional players in an already attractive market. In this case, I think it's clearly the latter. So, are there alternative exchange operators who would like to find a subsidized way to enter the attractive North American market? Absolutely. On our data center operators who currently are competing primarily on price, would like to add Internet exchange as a way to differentiate and they're willing to therefore directly and indirectly subsidize, get an exchange operator, so the data analysts can invest the OpEx to support that service? Yes, there are. And will certain large participants be willing to champion those efforts and make modest investments to support continued competitiveness in the market? You bet there are. So, all the ingredients are in place for these changes to surface and lo and behold they have. But the question really remains, will they get traction or they simply serve as a mechanism to ensure market discipline? And the answer to that question depends entirely on their ability to deliver value to customers and to networks. And as we talked about in the call last time, the real value that customers derive from being on an exchange is driven by the location and number of participants on the exchange, the ability to cost effectively access transit and private peering options to augment being on the exchange. The (indiscernible) and responsiveness associated with using the exchange, the quality and reliability of platform and importantly, the value that a customer can get from being in the data center beyond peering. And of course the price that they pay to capture all the dollar into value. And our focus and I think you're seeing it reflected in our results as you just described is on ensuring that we're delivering superior value along those dimensions. We're investing heavily in the platform, we're consistently evaluating our price point and its competiveness in the market and I think our market share and the momentum that you're seeing is reflectiveness of our competitiveness and the value we deliver. So, we're excited about the continued momentum. We see a lot of customers come in and saying, we want to continue to grow with you and we feel good about that progress.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Barden, Bank of America. Your line is open.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Thanks for a lot. Maybe Keith a couple for you. Just first on the buyback timing, how you're thinking about being proactive on that front. Obviously, the lower the price you're able to buy the stock at, not just the bigger benefit for you, but the bigger benefit for immunizing against the dilutive impacts of the converts coming up. If you could kind of help us think about the timetable or whether it's being impacted by some of the considerations around the REIT conversion? And then the second question is just supposing the IRS guys can shovel out their driveways and show up to work and get this PLR done sometime in the next quarter, can you walk us through what the next steps are, the timetable for the next steps, when would you think about having a shareholder vote presumably to do some of the reorganization issues? When would we have an E&P distribution, when would we have a dividend kind of policy announcement? Those sorts of things would be helpful. Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith","Yes, sure. I think David first and foremost, as I mentioned, so through the end of last year or through the end of 2013, we had spent roughly $49 million on the stock repurchase through the end of this call. Today, we're roughly up by 92.5 million of stock repurchase. A commitment that we made is it's a $500 million stock repurchase program. It would take place throughout \u2013 from the point when we authorize it to the end of 2014 and we'll continue to look for opportunities to buy our stock where we think is at an attractive level. And clearly the announcement we made in December was indicative of a point from the management team and our Board that we felt that this was not only going to be a good investment for us but also it was going to be added to the dilution as you can see from our convertible debt. So we'll continue to look at the opportunity that they present themselves and we'll announce it on a quarterly basis. As it relates to the REIT we continue to remain optimistic that we're going to get favorable response from the IRS. Using your scenario to the extent that that's something is forthcoming whether it is this quarter or whether it's next quarter. We think quickly thereafter we will start to worry about some of the other things, not to suggest that we are not worrying about it today. We're making sure that we deal with the shareholder votes and some of the amendments that we need dealing with the E&P purge for the period up there at the end of '14 and then as we look to something in '15. I would suspect through the purge itself is probably going to be in the latter part of the year although there's a number of very technical things that we're undertaking to review. And so until we hear back from the IRS, I hate saying this, it's premature for me to tell you exactly when, because we're such on international-oriented business and part of the structure will deal with the international assets. The E&P distribution on a forward basis is something that we'll continue to think through, but we're highly dependent on that PLR coming back. So we cleared it in the latter half of the year as we even see a lot of activity under the assumption that we hear back from the IRS over the near term.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And maybe just one last one if I could quickly, maybe Charles for you, just obviously Germany was a challenge last year. You've got some new leadership in there. What's been baked into the expectations for this year for the largest market in Europe right now?","Charles J. Meyers","Well, we do have a new leadership, our excited about that, spent some time with them just recently and I think very high quality executive that they're getting their arms around the business very quickly. We continue to make the appropriate changes there that need to be made to make sure that the team is performing well. And I think that we've been prudent about saying, okay, what is the \u2013 I think in our prior calls, we said the recovery won't be instantaneous. We've got to sort of get things in order and I think that our expectations for the year and therefore our guidance really contemplate and appropriate sort of riding of the ship there as we go into and through 2014. So, Steve, do you want to add [ph].","Stephen M. Smith","The only thing I'd add, David, is that as Charles alluded to, we did see improvement in the second half of '13 and we have high expectations that we'll put this business back on track in 2014. The new leader that Charles referred to is, he's in place. He's been on-boarded. He's an outstanding executive. He's already hired a new sales leader who starts momentarily and that team has been reinvigorated. So I think as Charles just alluded to, we have high expectations that you'll start to see the German market start to produce for us as it has in the past.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Steve. Appreciate it guys.","Operator","Our last question comes from Mike McCormack, Jefferies. Your line is open.","Mike McCormack - Jefferies","Hi, guys. Thanks. Just maybe a quick ramp question regarding the net neutrality issue to see how you guys weigh in on that, whether it affects your business in any way from a peering standpoint, maybe further content distribution? And then lastly just the thoughts on any expansion of offerings? Thanks.","Stephen M. Smith","Yes, on the net neutrality, Mike, as you guys probably saw it today the FCC took a position again, remains committed to the concept of the open Internet order. So I think we're supportive of that. With our neutral position, we don't really have a horse in this race so we'll sit on the sidelines on this one. On either side there's debate because all of these customers on both sides of this debate are important to us. So, there's not really a strong opinion or position that we take on this issue now but we'll watch it closely.","Charles J. Meyers","Yes, I think on the second one with regard to offerings that is an area where we're putting some significant focus. As I talked about, with our sales and marketing, energy, they need to be applied given who we are in the market and how we position, we need to really be targeted and be delivering offers that are responsive to the customer business requirements. And so if you look at our performance hub offerings which we spoke to in the script, that is really beginning to gain some traction with some key lighthouse account wins that we've had in the enterprise over the last couple of quarters and our focus is really now translating those into sort of quantifiable case studies that we can put in the hands of our sales team to get it out there and really drive broader attraction. So we'll continue to focus I think on enterprise relevant offers. We'll continue to package our core offers into some specific growth opportunities around mobility and digital advertising. And then I think in a very exciting way we're really focused on investments in the cloud area and looking at what offers that we can provide that will really drive hybrid cloud implementation and facilitate hybrid cloud implementations for enterprise customers. And so I'd say sort of keep your eyes out for announcements throughout the course of 2014 in that area.","Mike McCormack - Jefferies","Great. Charles, just thinking about the enterprise customer group, I've had a lot of questions regarding the importance of low latency. Is that something you hear a lot from those customers that they do care about that?","Charles J. Meyers","Well, it really depends on the applications that they're talking about but I would say more generally application performance matters a lot to them. And they have end customers \u2013 they being enterprise CIOs they have end customers in terms of their employees that require application performance. Sometimes that is a matter of latency, sometimes there are other issues involved, but I would say broadly in the enterprise segment, latency is \u2013 that's not true of every application set and that's why we really need to stay focused on areas where application performance in latency do matter. So we do hear that. Performance hub is one way to drive both improved costs efficiencies as well as better application performance. And then same thing on the cloud in terms of what we're offering on hybrid cloud as we talked about in the Foursquare implementation allows massive throughput improvements and improvements in cost efficiencies. Again, that's not really an enterprise implementation, but we are seeing those types of dynamics in the enterprise market as well. So, our areas of focus in the enterprise and where we're really going to be successful is where you need the network density, you need the access to the cloud ecosystem, you need application performance, you need global reach and that's how we're really focusing our sales and marketing investments.","Mike McCormack - Jefferies","Great.

Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. It's good to be joining all of you as we share our strong results for the start of 2018. As we come up on our 20th anniversary, we are excited to post our 61st quarter of consecutive revenue growth as we continue to cultivate powerful digital ecosystems on a global scale. With our recent acquisitions, we are now the market leader in 16 out of the 24 countries in which we operate, reflecting the size, scale and reach that we've built around the world. We serve 47% of the Fortune 500 and our penetration continues to tick up as new customers evolve their digital infrastructures, presenting an expanded opportunity set for us to target.","Turning to the results of the quarter, our differentiated platform continues to drive financial performance. As depicted on slide 3, first quarter revenues were $1.216 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $580 million for the quarter, up 11% over the same quarter last year, while AFFO growth was 13% year-over-year. These growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our metrics across MRR per cabinet, cross-connect additions, new customer acquisition and stabilized asset growth were all healthy. And our channel program had another strong quarter with 19% of our bookings originating from the channel and an outsized contribution to our strong new logo performance.","Interconnection revenues continue to outpace colocation, growing 16% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, reinforcing the foundational importance of interconnection in today's hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. For the full year, we see solid fundamentals as global infrastructure demand continues and we have a strong pipeline. Platform Equinix continues to scale as we have effectively doubled the size of our business over the last three years through both M&A and strong organic growth. We recently closed our 21st and 22nd acquisitions with the Infomart and Metronode, both of which saw good momentum during our closing period. Our footprint now extends across 200 IBXs and 52 markets, providing our customers a global platform to securely deploy and directly connect their digital infrastructures around the world.","Infomart Dallas is one of the most interconnected hubs in North America and home to four of our eight Dallas IBXs. By adding this landmark facility, we're strengthening our interconnection density, while also creating new opportunities to grow our business in the banking, technology, energy and health care sectors, in one of the largest colocation markets in the U.S. In addition, this sizable building currently houses more than 50 other tenants, which we will manage as a landlord. And in the future, the adjacent land on the property will be developed to provide over 40 megawatts of additional capacity for both retail and hyperscale.","Our Metronode acquisition establishes Equinix as the market leader in Australia, expanding our footprint from five to 15 data centers to accelerate interconnection and digital edge deployments nationwide. This acquisition gives us a stronger presence in our existing metros and a wider footprint with four new metros in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra and Perth. Metronode site in Perth will become the landing station for the new Vocus cable between Australia and Singapore, and positions Equinix as a leading hub for intercontinental connectivity and builds on our existing subsea traction in Sydney.","Meanwhile, our Verizon integration efforts are progressing well and we continue to be very pleased with the strategic benefits and the financial value from this transaction. However, I should note this quarter we absorbed higher pre-close customer terminations than we identified within the acquired installed base. We expect to fully conclude our integration efforts by the end of the year and we continue to see solid demand from both new and existing customers. So on balance, we expect flat revenue from Verizon this year as we work through the anticipated churn, while we see continued solid gross bookings into the Verizon sites and have a healthy pipeline for our planned expansions in Culpeper, Denver, Houston, Miami and Sao Paulo. Longer term, we expect the growth rate for the Verizon portfolio to be in line with our other stabilized assets.","Now, a few comments on our organic development activity. We are investing capital to build out the platform in response to strong underlying demand. In the first quarter, we completed builds in our Chicago, Osaka and Paris data centers. With our high level of inventory utilization and a growing sales funnel, we have a very active pipeline with 30 expansion projects currently underway across the platform. Half of these projects are in EMEA, our most utilized and fastest growing region, and greater than 75% of this expansion CapEx is allocated to mature metros that each generate over $100 million in revenue where established campuses and ecosystem density create strong and predictable fill rates.","We continue to see progress building our Hyperscale Infrastructure Team, also known as HIT, that will focus on developing facilities tuned to hyperscale requirements as we discussed last quarter. We're in the early stages and Paris 8, which opens at the end of this year, represents our first dedicated build for this initiative. We are also progressing well with financing structures that will allow us to pursue this important market with limited balance sheet exposure. We expect to add a handful of strategic builds across key markets over the next year and we have a healthy pipeline of attractive hyperscale opportunities.","Shifting to interconnection, we have the most complete interconnection portfolio in the industry and our goal is to be the connection route to everything customers require. We now have over 283,000 cross-connects with healthy net adds this quarter despite some continued headwinds for migration to 100-gig. We also saw strong peak traffic volumes across our leading industry exchanges. Our Internet Exchange Provisioned Capacity stepped up over the last quarter on strong 100-gig port adds and expansion in new EMEA markets. And our Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric continued to emerge as the foundational tool for customers implementing multi-cloud architectures. ECX saw record traffic levels and broadened its adoption now to over 1,100 customers. And now we're in the process of connecting our IBXs physically and virtually around the world through the Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric. We saw a good uptake with over 85 customers taking advantage of this expanded deployment capability.","We are continuing to evolve our global platform with the addition of new products and services, facilitating companies in their shift to digital and multi-cloud. We announced Equinix SmartKey this quarter, a new security key management service for multi-cloud and the first of several enabling services we plan to introduce in the coming quarters. We are focused on delivering new customer-inspired product and services that provide increasing value to our customers and connect them across a globally consistent data center and interconnection platform.","Now, let me cover some highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical had its second best bookings quarter fueled by continued infrastructure build out by both global and regional telecom providers to support the digital business needs of end customers and strong reseller momentum with our top NSP partners. The expansion this quarter included: Orange, which extended its footprint to support a commercial cloud offering; CenturyLink upgrading core infrastructure and leveraging Equinix dense ecosystems to support digital services; and Verizon expanding its footprint to support SD-WAN and content delivery. Equinix is also seeing continued momentum with the important subsea cable space where our position is meaningfully strengthened by our Metronode acquisition.","In financial services, we achieved significant bookings growth led by insurance and capital markets with strength in EMEA. Customer expansions included a European stock exchange adopting multi-cloud and expanding its footprint to re-architect IT as well as a top three global asset management firm increasing its footprint to improve business continuity and support multi-cloud. The content and digital media vertical experienced solid bookings led by the Asia Pacific region and by the e-commerce, gaming and CDN sub-segments.","Our cloud and IT vertical produced solid bookings led by SaaS providers as customers diversify towards a multi-cloud architecture. New customer adds included: Dropbox deploying infrastructure across 17 metros to expand its cloud storage platform; StackPath extending its footprint to provide security services at the edge; and DigitalOcean growing to support its international developer community with a scalable compute platform.","Turning to the enterprise vertical, our fastest growing vertical delivered diversified growth across health care, legal and travel with strong new logo adds. New wins in the Fortune 500 included a global beauty company deploying distributed data management for global workforce and regulatory compliance, and a large health insurance provider using Platform Equinix for cloud connectivity and data management. We also saw expansions from a top three rental car company implementing hybrid cloud to accelerate global IT transformation and Intercontinental Hotels Group leveraging Platform Equinix to connect to ecosystem partners in key metros.","So, let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover the results.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Thanks, PVC, and good afternoon to everyone. I'd like to start by highlighting that we had yet another solid start to a year. We had strong bookings with particular strength in both our EMEA and APAC regions, in part due to the level of imports received from the Americas region, a reflection of our global selling capabilities and the benefit of a global platform.","Our Q1 metrics included strong interconnection performance, increased provisioned port capacity, and firm MRR per cabinet, both by region and on a consolidated basis. And we continued to accentuate the key points of differentiation between our business and our peers, including investing in new products and services, scaling our sales force as our business grows, and supporting a broader initiative around customer experience.","Our investment decisions allow us to continue to separate ourselves from our competitors, as we pursue this differentiated business opportunity that we see in front of us. For 2018, we're guiding to revenue growth of 9% including the Verizon assets. This guidance includes a meaningful step up in bookings and revenue on a much larger base, while driving more cash flow to the business as reflected in both our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.","In April, we closed the Metronode and Infomart Dallas transactions. The Metronode acquisition makes Equinix the market leader in Australia with a national footprint and a customer base that includes strong government traction. Metronode continued to experience strong momentum through the close of the transaction. And our guidance now assumes an annualized revenue run rate of approximately $50 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of greater than 50%. The ten IBX assets in the Metronode portfolio, nine of which are owned, provide incremental land for future expansions. The current Metronode footprint is highly utilized at greater than 90% and we will move quickly to build out additional capacity, which we expect to be available in 2019. Once this additional inventory builds out, we expect Metronode assets to show a healthy revenue growth.","We're also very excited about the Infomart Dallas asset purchase, one of the most connected buildings in North America. Our primary emphasis will be on maximizing our existing $100 million business inside the Infomart, while also assessing other opportunities to drive increased shareholder value including expanded development of the building and the adjacent land. Also, we'll continue to support the current tenant base, which generates annualized revenues of $35 million with accretive adjusted EBITDA margins to our current business, and we will enjoy approximately $14 million of cash rent savings related to the deal as we effectively become our own landlord. The benefit of which will be a reduction in our interest expense and a decrease in our capital lease liability as our Infomart leases were treated as capital versus operating leases.","For integration costs, we're updating our guidance to now approximate $50 million for 2018 including $15 million of cost related to the Infomart and Metronode acquisitions.","Now, looking at the first quarter, Q1 was another strong quarter of operating performance. As depicted on slide 4, Global Q1 revenues was $1.216 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year. As expected, NRR revenues decreased by $12 million compared to Q4, bringing our NRR revenues to 5% of total revenues, consistent with our historical levels.","EMEA and APAC were the fastest growing regions at 12% year-over-year growth each, followed by the Americas at 7%. The Verizon assets contributed $135 million of revenues, flat quarter-over-quarter as we identified and absorbed the higher pre-close customer terminations and credits as PVC outlined. As we exit 2018, we expect the Verizon asset revenues to grow nicely with the integration behind us and the investments being made in the core Verizon markets.","Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $7 million positive currency benefit when compared to the Q4 average FX rates and a $6 million positive currency benefit when compared to our FX guidance range due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $580 million, up 11% over the same quarter last year, and higher than expectations due to improving gross profit, largely due to lower than planned utility expense and timing of integration costs. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.1% excluding integration costs. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, had a $1 million positive benefit when compared to both the Q4 average FX rates and our FX guidance rates.","Global Q1 AFFO was $415 million, up 13% over the same quarter last year, largely due to strong adjusted EBITDA performance and lower than planned recurring capital expenditures. AFFO per share was $5.21; the first time we eclipsed the $5 per share threshold in a quarter, and a meaningful 26% uplift over the same quarter last year. Q1 global MRR churn was 2.4%, and we expect 2018 MRR churn to continue to average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter for the rest of the year.","Now turning to the regional highlights whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. We continue to benefit from the power of our global selling engine with over 58% of our revenues coming from customers deployed globally across all three regions and 84% across multiple metros. The Americas region had solid revenue and adjusted EBITDA results in the first quarter, while absorbing the expected decrease in non-recurring revenues or NRR. As we discussed previously, NRR can be lumpy and vary from quarter-to-quarter particularly related to custom installation work, provided to customers for their deployments. Cabinets billing were positive, but lighter than the four-quarter average due to timing of customer installations.","Turning to EMEA, we saw record bookings this quarter led by the strength in our German and Dutch markets with continued growth in our interconnection revenues. Our new EMEA Internet exchange deployments experienced solid early traction including our Dublin, Frankfurt and London markets. And Asia-Pacific delivered its second best bookings quarter with particular strength in our Australian and Singaporean markets. We continue to enjoy strong momentum across the platform from leading Chinese service providers with significant expansion activity coming from Alibaba and Tencent.","Interconnection revenues had a strong quarter, up 4% over last quarter, adding over 5,000 cross-connects as we continue our steady pace of growth. The Americas and Asia-Pacific interconnection revenues were 22% and 14% respectively, while EMEA stepped up 10% of recurring revenues. From a total company perspective, interconnection revenues were 17% of total recurring revenues.","And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to slide 8. We continue to optimize our capital structure and take advantage of the low interest rate environment. In Q1, we completed a \u20ac750 million high yield offering at a very attractive interest rate, adding appropriate liquidity on the balance sheet to fund our various initiatives. Our net debt leverage ratio pro forma for our two recent acquisitions increased to 4.5 times our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA. We expect our net debt leverage ratio to revert to our target range of three to four times over the next few quarters.","Turning to slide 9, for the quarter, capital expenditures were $350 million, including recurring CapEx of $35 million. Currently, we have 30 new construction projects underway, two-thirds of which are on owned properties, adding capacity in 20 markets around the world. Our 2018 capital plan is significant, a recognition that there is attractive demand across our now 52-market portfolio. And this step up in investment is required to support the scale of our business. We also recently purchased our Stockholm 2 data center and purchased land parcels for future expansions in Frankfurt, Helsinki, and Tokyo. Revenue from owned assets stepped up to over 45% with the close of the Infomart and Metronode acquisitions.","Our capital investments are delivering healthy growth and strong returns as shown on slide 10. Stabilized IBX revenues grew 6% year-over-year on a same store basis, largely driven by increasing interconnection revenues and increased power density. Also, consistent with prior years, during Q1, we completed our annual refresh of new expansion and stabilized asset categorizations. Our stabilized asset count increased by net 10 IBXs. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 29% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.","And finally, please refer to slides 11 through 16 for our summary of 2018 guidance and bridges. For the full year 2018, we're raising our revenue guidance by $92 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $45 million, excluding integration costs, primarily due to favorable FX rates and the acquisitions. This guidance implies a revenue growth rate including Verizon assets of 9% year-over-year and a healthy adjusted EBITDA margin of 48%, excluding integration costs. The momentum of our business continues to drive AFFO and AFFO per share.","We're maintaining our 2018 AFFO per share guidance of $20.82 per share, excluding integration costs, absorbing the impact of $50 million of incremental debt service costs and the impact of the two recent acquisitions for the first 12 months of their operations. We've assumed a weighted-average 80 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. AFFO is expected to grow 12% year-over-year on a reported basis. We expect 2018 non-recurring capital expenditures to now range between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, which takes into consideration the Infomart Dallas and Metronode transactions.","And finally turning to dividends, for 2018, we expect to pay out total cash dividends of $725 million, an 18% increase over the prior year and reflects an AFFO payout ratio of approximately 45%. Consistent with the prior quarter, the Q2 cash dividend is $2.28 per share.","So with that, let me stop here and turn it back to PVC.","Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Thanks, Keith. In closing, we continue to deliver solid results growing at a healthy pace, investing in future capabilities and showing strong performance as we increase our interconnection penetration, traction with a Global 2000 customer and a firm MRR per cabinet. The demands of digital transformation continue to be a major force in the market and we are seeing a meaningful transition as both service provider and enterprise customers adopt hybrid and multi-cloud as the IT architecture of choice.","We are uniquely positioned to help customers navigate this transition and are boosting our competitive edge through investment in go to market efforts, and the evolution of the reach, scale and capabilities of our highly differentiated global platform. We have targeted and are pursuing this expanding opportunity set and are scaling our global platform to meet the demand fueled by a strong sales pipeline to drive our regions for the remainder of the year.","So, let me stop here and Charlotte, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, thank you. So walk us through a little bit through the expansion opportunities in Europe. I mean at the beginning of the year, you updated some CapEx, a lot of which was due to that, maybe give us an idea there. And then give us an idea of what sort of expansion capabilities are left in Culpeper and Miami specifically as you look at trying to grow those Verizon assets a little more. Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Sure, Frank. Let me start and the others perhaps can jump in. First and foremost, as you can see, we still have 30 projects that are currently underway. The European theater is our fastest growing region and so from our perspective, recognizing the majority of the investment's going to go into what we call the flat markets, so Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Paris. It's a reflection of basically the momentum that we're seeing in. And so as we exit sort of Q1, I think you're going to really see the majority of that benefit coming through sort of the middle of the year, through the back end of the year as we continue to install our customers. And I'm sorry I've now forgotten the second part of your question.","Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.","It's Culpeper and Miami.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Oh, that's right. And as it relates to Culpeper and Miami, Miami for all intents and purposes, is are relatively untapped opportunity for \u2013 it was an untapped opportunity that we wanted to realize. There's roughly 3,000 available cabinets coming out of it now for the Americas and we've started the first major build. We did a small build to create a little bit more capacity, but we're really looking forward to that incremental build and one of the things that was really interesting is we talk about the core markets related to the Verizon assets. The majority of those assets are greater than 90% or near 90% utilized and as a result, we need that capacity to continue to scale. Now we made some minor refinements to the utilization rates of the Verizon assets. It's roughly 82% from the 87% we talked about in the last quarter.","That all said though when you look at the markets that we really want to develop and we're putting capital to work at those top five markets that PVC alluded to and so we're eager to get to the Miami market and create more capacity, also in the Culpeper market because the pipeline is healthy and supportive of that expansion opportunity.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And is there a major expansion in Miami within the same building or is it just near...","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Actually, it's the same building and what's interesting is only the first part of \u2013 there is a multitude of opportunities for us there. As I said, it's roughly a \u2013 think of it as a potential incremental 3,000 plus cabinets in the NAP of the Americas. So, it's in our expansion tracking sheet. Frank, you also noticed that we had a small build as I said through the last quarter of 2017, but we really are looking forward to the build out, it's roughly \u2013 (29:04) was just showing me here, roughly 1,100 cabinets will be available in Q3.","And part of the reason that we talked about the Verizon assets again, we're going through if you will, the \u2013 we refer to it as pre-close customer terminations and some churn and we're making some very prudent assumptions in the go-forward basis and what we should expect. But one of the things that we want you to walk away is the recognition that the majority of our growth is going to come from these core markets. And that inventory is not going to be available until the second half of the year, hence why we've decided to say let's hold the Verizon assets flat through the remainder of the year pending that and also recognizing that we'll continue to make some assumptions on churn through the remaining part of the year.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great.","Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. Just a final note, Frank, on Miami as you may recall, it is a very dense interconnection hub that also is the destination for all the routes down to South America. So it largely had no room to expand, so a great opportunity into the Verizon acquisition was to create that room because this will be certainly a site that will have a strong fill rate against it once we have the capacity in place.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Phil?","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sorry. As I look at the pace of CapEx, I expect we'll be building through the year. One, is that fair? And two, does that lead to next year being a fairly heavy investment year as well?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Well, as you can see, I mean, the \u2013 what's interesting on the expansion tracking sheet that we shared with you Phil is that the majority of \u2013 the vast majority of the build will take \u2013 will have assets opening up through the second half of the year. And again just sort of eyeballing it's roughly 22,000 to 23,000 cabinets. But we do anticipate that some of that will also spill into 2019. Again, there will be facts and circumstances specific as you know we're now servicing a 52 market portfolio. We're going to look at our fill rates. We spend a lot of energy breaking that down, looking at not only the pipeline, the empirical fill rates, but also the competitive dynamics in the market. And we'll update you on our thinking for 2019 in the \u2013 probably in the not too distant future. I'm not sure we'll be able to do it by Analyst Day, but certainly as we get to back end of the year you'll get a good sense of what we're thinking about for 2019. Suffice it to say though with the momentum that we see in the pipeline opportunity, you would expect \u2013 you should expect us to continue to invest meaningfully on the CapEx line.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure. And is it more challenging to build in Europe? It just seems like the capacity is coming on a little later on that side than in the U.S.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","I wouldn't say, it's any more difficult. Again it's market specific as you can probably appreciate. It depends on the regulatory environment, the compliance requirements, the ability to get available contractors. Some markets, like a Tokyo market, could be a bit more difficult than other markets. But Europe in and of itself has not historically been a tough market and because we're building a lot adjacent to our existing facilities contiguous to our assets or in close proximity, it makes it a lot easier for us to build out in that market. And then as you can see, the majority of the assets again in the expansion tracking sheet that are going to be built are the London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and Paris market. And we've had some pretty strong experience over the not too distant future building out in those markets.","Where it takes you a little bit longer is if it's a first phase build because you're building it from the ground up and that of course takes a lot of work as you are developing the land and you're building the core and shelf, but from that point forward it becomes relatively cookie cutter-ish.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Keith.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin from RBC. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good afternoon. I wondered, Keith, if you could provide further details around the financings structures that you kind of mentioned in the script around hyperscale, and are they kind of \u2013 are they unique to certain regions or countries or might it be kind of global in nature? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, Jonathan, we want to spend a lot of energy in this, between Charles and we probably will take this on in a much more healthy way at the Analyst Day, but suffice to say we are thinking \u2013 we're probably thinking more specific to our market or region. We don't have a global view. I think, it's tough recognizing that we might have different investors investing in different theaters with us and as a result the structures can be a little bit different.","What's really important here is we want to take this opportunity, we're going to be very strategic about it, and we're going to try and push as much of that off balance sheet as possible and enjoy the benefits of the investment, yet partnering up with others to use capital and put leverage on it, so it makes sense for the business and it doesn't allows us to continue to focus on our retail business. That give us some time on the Analyst Day, and we'll probably have that a little bit more fleshed out for you.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right. To a degree it sounds like your choice of location, your next locations could be influenced by financial considerations then?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Well, I think, it's more about \u2013 sorry, Charles and I were just deciding who is going to take this one. Let me just say the first part is, look there's plenty of financing opportunities out there for us. So, our constraint is not going to be about our financing.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I agree. I think we're going to go to the market opportunity based on what the customer demand is, and which investments and projects we think are accretive to our leadership position in the cloud enabled enterprise ecosystem. And so and we are building a very robust funnel of those opportunities. We've got a very positive response from the customer set. Jim now is \u2013 Jim Smith is now on board as a full-time employee, we're really energized about that he's bringing an exceptional experience and skillset to the table. So we're building funnel quickly and we're not going to let, I think, the financing get in the way of what we're going to \u2013 what we're going to \u2013 how we're going to respond to the market opportunity. So \u2013 but I would say as Keith said, it's likely that it's going to be a number of underlying structures and those may have slightly different characteristics based on the profile of both our existing and future assets in those markets. And ideally what we want to get to is a situation where we have a highly responsive agile capability to respond to these hyperscale requirements. The ones that we think are strategic, but do that without a lot of balance sheet exposure. And I think, we're tracking well against that objective, and like Keith said you'll hear more about that as we get to Analyst Day.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then just quickly on integration on Infomart Dallas. Is there any kind of implication for the Americas cross-connect trends that we might see now that you own the entire building? And then on Verizon, I appreciate you're giving utilization number there, 82%, are you marketing the vacated space, is there demand for it and might there be a different customer profile for that absorption versus your traditional product? Thanks.","Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Well, certainly there will be growth as we start to expand in interconnection in Dallas. And so we'll see a lot of value to our density there and bringing that to more customers as they come onboard, but we are the interconnection hub in the Infomart already. So you'll see continued growth out of us and as we expand more customers will come through it but it's not a differently acquired set of interconnection services that we've gotten there.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","And Jonathan I think I'd just add on to what PVC says, what's really important here is there's really a separation between what we're doing with the Metronode acquisition, which is \u2013 which really has to be wholly integrated versus the Dallas \u2013 or the Infomart Dallas which is more of an asset purchase, right. And integrations are a lot easier for us in that asset relative to a 10-building operating business in Australia. And in both cases, we're holding on top of our integration efforts. We're excited about where we sit and I think we'll give you a little bit of the details around what we think we can accomplish this year. But as we continue to invest around these assets, I think that's going to give us an opportunity for continued growth in that portfolio and that asset.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","And what was the second part of your question, again, Jonathan?","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Yeah. The vacant Verizon space and to what extent that's being marketed? Are you seeing interest, any sort of different profile that \u2013 of customer that might go into that vacated space versus legacy Equinix IBX?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, we position it, as we've always made clear we sell as a platform, right. So we want to quickly integrate assets into the portfolio and then position those across the customer base globally and ensure that all the sales teams are selling those. So individual assets appeal to different use cases, that's not a distinction of Verizon. That's true of our assets as well. And so, I think we are \u2013 we're marketing those very effectively, the team is up to speed on how to position those. We are seeing good gross demand and bookings into those facilities. And in fact what I would highlight is, is that the flat guide for Verizon revenue through the remainder of the year is an artifact of the, of sort of what are \u2013 what we're finding in terms of churn related to some of the pre-close sort of cancellations that were there as we sorted through that, and just a prudent assessment on our part of kind of what we ought to imply about growth. And so \u2013 but not a reflection of, I think, a lack of demand there because we are seeing solid bookings into those facilities.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. Just wondering, if there was any update on the board's search for a permanent CEO. And also on the U.S. MRR per cabinet, and the interconnect volumes, I think, you referenced the moved to 100-gig. Can you just talk a little bit more about the puts and takes driving that versus some of the strength you've seen in other regions? Thank you.","Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. First on the new CEO appointment, there's really no update there. Just as a team we're continuing to pursue our 2018 opportunity. And so nothing new to add, I think you're going to just assume, I'll continue in the seat for a few quarters here. And besides that on interconnection, it has been interesting. We saw a solid interconnection uptick this quarter, in revenue seeing it 16% year-over-year. And of course that was in the face of a 100-gig. 100-gig showing up more in the United States than anywhere else, because certainly the dense interconnect or Internet interconnection that we have here is a reason for it doing as well as it is, and we're seeing good growth in ports of a 100-gig, but still nice to see interconnection as a whole growing as strongly as it is in the face of that.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. Just a little incremental color there, Simon, we \u2013 there's actually a relatively small number of players, who have the sort of traffic profile that warrants the sort of the investment in 100-gig optics. And so what we're seeing is those where, there is a strong economic justification to make that investment. They're sort of leading the way on surprisingly and many of those are well, well through their migration. So I think we still got a little bit to go in terms of seeing some of that headwind but what we do and I'm sure this will not be surprising to you but we look very closely at the gross adds, as well as kind of what the term profile is. And what we want to make sure is that we're seeing sustained gross demand and that is in fact the case.","And so in fact, I would argue that we're seeing a more robust and more diverse use case portfolio for interconnection broadly, both at the physical layer in terms of cross-connects and at the virtual layer now with ECX. And so, I think really all-in-all a very good story there relative to the interconnection portfolio and how it's performing.","We did a quartiles analysis which sort of showed what our concentration of interconnection was and how it was changing over time and a lot of goodness in that analysis as we looked at really key \u2013 sort of new robust long-term use cases we think driving this new demand profile, including private cloud connectivity. And a much longer tail of enterprise customers now finding utility in private interconnection even at the physical layer and they often start at a virtual with ECX and then as they aggregate traffic or have a different performance requirement, then they move to the cross-connect. And there's just nobody that can \u2013 and then having the Internet, the IX as well, there's just nobody that can sort of respond to that full profile the way we can. So very excited about how the interconnection business is performing overall.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC","Great. Thank you. Two if I may. First off, on Americas cabinet adds, they're negative in the quarter, and I'm just trying to get a better sense how much of that came from the Verizon assets and what's going on there. And I think you may have mentioned some delayed installs. Just trying to get a better understanding of the various components that drove that number.","And then secondly as it relates to the HIT business, in the past quarter you had mentioned some notable wins. I'm just curious if there's any other big wins that occurred in the first quarter and if so if you could break out by geography, however detailed you want. Thank you.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","So, Colby, just on the Americas cabinet adds, so you'll see in our tracking sheets or non-financial where it's actually 400 net adds in the quarter. Where we had made some comment is we made a slight adjustment to the opening balance of the Verizon assets. And so that might be skewing your calculation and so we took that number down and went from 87% utilization down to the 82% I referred to. But when you look at the core business non-Verizon, it was really 400 net adds in the quarter. And then the other question was...","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, well, and just let me finish on that one. That's, again, as we've said, that is really a timing artifact. We had a really strong quarter last quarter on cabinet adds. We've had sort of some of this lumpiness in that profile and generally chalk that up to timing. You have to really look at I think on cabinet adds over a sort of multi-quarter period and sort of draw a trend line into that. So no alarm from our perspective as to the health of the cabinet adds, so that's that one.","The second one was with regard to HIT. We did have a win, some wins that we had talked about. We are actively engaged in deal discussions for both projects that are hyperscale oriented into some existing facilities, but now really starting to ramp up, where we're talking about deals that are going to go into dedicated HIT facilities.","And so as we said, there's probably just a couple of projects that we're doing now, Paris 8 being there and then some other European centric projects that we're looking at that will start to roll out in the near future. And again, we're in active discussions with anchor customers to start to take up some of that demand.","So no new net wins to report, but I think I would characterize it as exceptionally healthy funnel and great progress in terms of winning the kinds of deals that we want to win.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC","And just to clarify on the Americas cabinets, so is it fair to say then that the Verizon portfolio, those cabinets remain I guess flat based on the new accounting. And is the 400 that you added, that was basically I guess we'll call traditional Equinix?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yes.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Okay. Yes, organic business.","Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Yes.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","That's right. Yeah.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much and good afternoon folks.","Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I wanted to touch base on sort of the M&A landscape. We hear commentary from other players in the market. There seems to suggest that some of the private company valuations are a bit high at the moment and may temper some of the M&A activity levels. What are your thoughts on sort of potential for additional inorganic growth from your perspective?","Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Well, I think that's a very fair point and certainly private equity's interest in our recent Infomart acquisition was evident in the end price as well as probably Metronode as well. So some of that is out there. I won't speak to the rest of the M&A activity in the industry, but I think where we'll be focused for a period of time here, will be more towards new markets that might be interesting, that just complement the reach of the platform or are valuable for customers and that strategic benefit. So ultimately there may be some of that influence in play, but a place we've wanted to be and haven't quite found the right answer, but will always have an eye on it is something like India, and maybe South Korea as another market that could be interesting to us. But again these are more extending the platform versus something that is more transformational like a Telecity we did a couple years ago, Verizon this past year.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's very helpful. And then a follow-up question perhaps for Keith. If we think about sort of the leverage ratio and where your longer term targets of 3 to 4 times are, I mean, if we adjust for the senior notes, seems like you're above that target ratio right now. How should we think about sort of your progress to continue to bring you within that target range? And should you pursue additional M&A, how should we think about further financing?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. Amir, that's a great question. So maybe adding on to what PVC said, you know again, a lot of what we're looking at today as a company as we think next M&A is going to be a new market opportunity or a tuck-in acquisition. As you can appreciate with two transactions that we just closed in April, we'll go out in different forms and different levels of integration, eight different integrations that are ongoing now. And so as a company we're going to continue to focus on integrating the assets and bringing efficiency. As it relates to our capital structure, we're pro forma to the \u2013 pro forma the two transactions that closed in April were 4.5 times levered, our Q1 adjusted EBITDA. Clearly with the continued growth of the business that number is going to decrease, as we continue to scale the business. We've always taken a very prudent view on maximizing shareholder value, using both debt and equity, where appropriate. As a company, we want to maintain our goal of appropriate leverage, but not too much leverage, making sure that we have \u2013 or making sure that at some point in time, we'll get to our aspiration of becoming an investment-grade rated company.","Albeit today, I'm not sure, I'm not sure with the 4.5 times leverage here that that's within the next 12 months, but we still have a stated objective to become investment grade. Again we'll be using our capital structure as effectively, as we can, and in some cases as Charles alluded to earlier on, we'll partner with others off balance sheet to continue to grow other elements of the opportunity set without using our balance sheet.","So bottom line, I think, it's a reasonable expectation over the not too distant future that you should see us get more towards our stated target of 4 times leverage, that's at the top end of the range. As we continue to scale the business over the next three to five years. I think, it's reasonable to assume that leverage will be very, very much within our target ranges. And with our aspiration of getting to investment grade, I think we'll put ourselves in a good position with a very balanced view on capital.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much for giving the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just going back to the Verizon performance and some of the reductions in the guidance for that, I was just curious, I mean, you kept your overall churn guidance basically flat on a quarterly basis. I mean, should we interpret that as the rest of the business is doing a bit better than previously expected, absent some of the terminations at Verizon?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Well, Vin, part of the Verizon assets in and of themselves, it's slightly elevated churn. As you recall, I might recall when we first acquired the Verizon assets we started out with $450 million guide and then we added in the affiliated revenues. By the time we exited last year of 2017 we were roughly a $540 million revenue business. As part of that we always said that there is an element of churn that we know that we're going to experience and we had sales reserves that we had put in place. What you're experiencing now is the churn that we were guiding to a while back that we just had not yet experienced.","And as a result that roughly \u2013 that low single-digit growth that we were expecting in fiscal year 2018 we're going to now hold it flat. Again we think that's very prudent, but as Charles and PVC alluded to we have a very strong bookings pipeline \u2013 sorry, pipeline with the Verizon assets. We've seen strong gross bookings. We feel we've got a handle on what we're looking at as it relates to Verizon, as a result with our churn being at 2.4% this quarter and holding our average flat. Again, recognizing it's within the scope of what we already had anticipated this year, so I would say that, if you're saying that this is going up a little bit then it's suffice to say then the organic business is going down a little bit.","But overall there's no meaningful change in the churn that we were modeling for the year. And so I feel comfortable we'll put ourselves in a good position to not only again hold the revenue flat, there's roughly $15 million, $20 million adjustment to our guidance for Verizon this year. And I think as we exit the year you're going to see us not only because we fully integrated, I think, the assets, but because of the investments in the core markets you're going to see solid growth coming out of 2018 on top of those Verizon assets.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then just another question more on the construction side. We've already heard from many REITs that construction costs are going up sort of on the order of maybe 5% or 6% from an inflationary perspective. When I look at the pipeline that you have outlined and the spending that you have planned for the year, I guess how much of that is fixed in terms of deals, covered by some sort of contract or is there a risk of that going higher because of just overall inflation?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","As a company we have a pretty good \u2013 we have a very large and deep pipeline of construction activity. We have great relationships with our vendors, our providers. From our perspective, we think we get an \u2013 we have an opportunity, that's probably broader than most given the investments that we're making. That all said, there's inflationary pressures, and it's going to be market and material specific. As a company we're building contingencies when we give guidance to take into consideration, pricing fluctuations. But overall we're working real hard to drive down our average cost to build, and some of that comes from different construction techniques, part of it different design specific. And also ways to run the IBXs more efficiently after they've been built. So overall I'd just say it'll be facts and circumstances specific and again, we've got a \u2013 I think, we have a handle on it, and you shouldn't feel that there'd be any meaningful change to our guidance because of what is perceived to be cost increases.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Gutman from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two questions, actually. One, given the timing of the cabinet deliveries in Europe, and the scale as well, and weighted to the second half, should we be assuming an acceleration in recurring revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, because it's been stable for the past several quarters at about 12%. I just want to know if you expected or should we expect it to accelerate? And after that, I just have one more.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","I think, when it comes to the European, we'll call the recurring revenue stream, certainly you're going to see an opportunity as to fill up that capacity. And as a result, by filling up the capacity in a more timely fashion, you should see some level of acceleration, there's some periodic blips that we experienced this quarter, where we \u2013 the revenues in EMEA was only growing just over 12% year-over-year. I think, there's an opportunity to see that number go up certainly as you get to the back end of the year.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. And the second question regards the 6% growth in stabilized assets. It's been coming from cross-connect and power density. I don't know the proportions of each. But really on the power density side, is there \u2013 in stabilized assets is there a flexibility to continue to add power density?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Absolutely, I mean, no different than adding an incremental cross-connect, as customers put more infrastructure into a given cabinet or a cage environment, they'll draw increased power, and so it's managing the relationship of the physical space with the power capacity. And so in both cases, we have been and historically have worked very hard to optimize our assets. And so you will get more power draw from those stabilized assets as you will get more interconnection.","Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. And occasionally we even take on specific projects in assets, particularly assets with a slightly longer vintage to say, hey, can we \u2013 as we make upgrades, can we improve the power density of the facility and therefore accommodate more power in certain cases. So those are certainly levers available to us in the business.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Michael Rollins from Citi Research. Your line is now open.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. First, I was wondering if you can maybe give us a little bit of a preview in terms of how the company is thinking about the longer term revenue growth opportunity when you take into account the number of acquisitions that you've done since the last update. And secondly, if you look at the growth rate guidance at about 9% including Verizon for 2018 on an organic basis. Can you give us a sense of how much stronger some of the regions are versus the others, and maybe just give us a sense of where each region is shaking out within the totality of the guidance? Thanks.","Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Sure. I'll just react to the first part. Obviously with some of the bigger acquisitions we've done like a Verizon and different growth rates that does add to the size of the overall business. And so when you think about go forward growth, it definitely has an impact. Certainly, we feel very good about our thinking this year, how we relate to even market growth rates and continuing to outpace growth rates for retail colocation, Mike, so continued on a positive track in that direction. Well, that will give you a better sense of growth as we get to Analyst Day and we'll outline a CAGR for the coming year, so I think it will be helpful to you on that regard.","And then what was the second half? Keith, did you get it?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Regional color across the...","Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, growth for regional color.","Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. Well obviously, as we've said EMEA has been performing very well and contributing at a higher growth rate. Asia on a smaller number continues to hit bookings and doing very, very well, contributing to our overall growth rate as well and solid in Americas.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah.","Peter F. van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","I don't know, Charles, do you want to add any color to that or...?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. I think, yeah, little bit of the normal dynamics, you're seeing which is Americas is a larger and more mature market. The other markets are tending to follow in terms of some of the activities in terms of penetration and other factors that are both \u2013 driving both demand and potential substitution effects, et cetera. So, there's \u2013 I think, we are \u2013 we continue to see exceptional health in EMEA, our competitive position there is outstanding. Our pipeline of projects is strong. Our sales pipeline is strong. So continued strong results in the EMEA market. APAC has good underlying secular forces driving those markets and again Americas a little bit starting to see, a little bit of dip in growth rates. We still think we're growing ahead of the market in Americas.","But what we're seeing from our \u2013 what we think are the most credible estimates of market growth in the Americas is more in the 5.5% range and we're growing the business meaningfully above that and we're doing that with a return profile and a yield profile that is head and shoulders above the rest. And so there's pockets of headwinds, probably across all markets in certain cases, but we're staying very disciplined about what deals we're pursuing, continuing to focus on use cases where we bring distinctive value, and therefore can preserve returns and pricing over time, but that's a little color on across the regions.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And if I could just one other follow-up, with all the development that you've laid out in your development schedule, is the goal to increase organic growth in 2019 over 2018?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","(1:01:47). Thank you for the question, but we really like to spend more energy thinking about that and we'll be updating you on the June 20 Analyst Day on our thinking both as well as the organic business and certainly the inorganic business, and there's a recognition that over the last few years, we've been buying assets that have been slower growing than the overall organic business. And so we want to give you color on what that means and how does it look on a go forward basis as we take you out five years from 2018 through 2022.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Charles J.

In the interest of wrapping this call within an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Thanks, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I am privileged to host my first call today as CEO and I feel honored to lead the incredible team of nearly 8,000 dedicated Equinix employees around the globe in service to each other, to our customers, and to our shareholders. I am as excited as ever about the role we play in helping customers drive their digital transformation agenda and about the value creation opportunity this represents for our investors. Having been a part of the leadership team at Equinix for the past eight years, I am extremely proud of our track record of success. We have more than quadrupled the size of our business since 2010, have now deployed over $22 billion of capital across the globe to build the world's leading interconnection platform, and we are rapidly emerging as the trusted center of a cloud-first world. As stewards of some of the most important digital infrastructure in the world, our priority is and will remain delivering exceptional, durable, and quantifiable value to our customers.","In doing so, we believe we can sustain a demonstrably superior business model, which will in turn deliver outsized returns for our shareholders. I'm fortunate to build further on this strong foundation and as a global team, we will certainly remain focused on extending our core sources of differentiation: superior global reach, market-leading network and cloud density, the industry's most comprehensive interconnection portfolio, scaled digital ecosystems, and an unwavering commitment to service excellence. But I also recognize that we must continue to adapt and evolve in response to the rapidly changing needs of our market. We will continue to refine our priorities for the business as we shape our operating plan and prepare to update you on our 2019 guidance early next year.","However, I want to outline six immediate priorities that are worth noting as central elements of our go-forward agenda. First, we will expand our go-to-market engine, investing behind the significant momentum we have, helping customers, implement hybrid and multi-cloud as their architecture of choice. Second, we'll evolve our capabilities and product portfolio to make Equinix more powerful, easier to use, more accessible platform to drive digital transformation, delivering new services that will help us sustain and enhance cabinet yields over the coming years.","Third, we will look to more deeply engage a shortlist of high priority partners that we believe can substantially extend our solution and amplify our go-to-market reach. Fourth, we will significantly sharpen our focus on driving increased operating leverage to enable investments in the business, drive long-term margin expansion, and fuel AFFO per share. Fifth, we'll focus on delivering against our hit strategy, allowing us to advance our global leadership in the cloud ecosystem, while reducing strain on our balance sheet. And finally, and most importantly, we will continue to invest in our people and our culture as the primary engine behind our sustained performance.","As we execute against these priorities, we will be appropriately sensitive to near-term results, but our focus, as it always has been, will remain firmly on the creation of sustainable long-term value, and as appropriate, we will not shy away from investments in the business when we are confident that those investments will generate an outsized return.","With this in mind, I'm excited to share our strong operating results for Q3. We had a great third quarter with revenues and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance ranges, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and the growth of our interconnection platform. As depicted on slide 3, revenues were $1.284 billion, up 9% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was 7% above our guidance due to lower integration costs and timing of spend, and AFFO was ahead of our expectations. These growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis.","Bookings were strong across the regions with a record in APAC and particularly, robust growth in the cloud and content verticals. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace colocation growing at 13% year-over-year. Our metrics across the interconnection counts, billable cabinets, and MRR per Cab were all healthy this quarter and reflect solid execution of our strategy. We also saw substantial progress with our three latest acquisitions, Infomart, Metronode and Verizon, all of which are tracking well against our expectations. For Metronode, we're building further in Sydney and Melbourne as well as our new Metro in Perth, which has seen increased interest from cloud service providers and multinationals.","For Infomart Dallas, we continue to refine our long-term master plan for the Infomart location including our final phase of Dallas 6. And finally, for Verizon, we opened new capacity in five key markets including our marquee asset, the NAP of the Americas in Miami, the government focused campus of Culpeper as well as new capacity in Denver, Houston and S\u00e3o Paulo. The strong pipeline for these locations combined with focused churn management give us confidence that the Verizon assets will return to growth next year.","Now, let me make a few comments on our organic development activity. We are actively investing capital with 30 expansion projects underway across 21 of our markets in response to customer demand. In the third quarter, we opened nine builds across Frankfurt, Miami, Rio de Janeiro and Singapore. Greater than 80% of current expansion project CapEx is allocated to metros each generating over $100 million in revenues. These markets are well established campuses that drive predictable fill rates and high levels of interconnection.","With respect to our Hyperscale Infrastructure Team or HIT, we're seeing continued momentum and a strong pipeline as we design and build initial capacity, expand our team and work to finalize our financing structures, which have generated tremendous interest, and which we expect to have in place by early next year. In parallel, we're adding capacity in hybrid facilities such as London 9 and 10 to capture early wins and maintain momentum. We will open our first dedicated HIT facility, Paris 8, early next year and have seen strong pre-leasing with key cloud customers.","Shifting to interconnection, our global interconnection platform is powering digital transformation for nearly 10,000 customers around the world, and we see continued adoption across our market-leading portfolio. We now have over 294,000 cross-connects with healthy net adds despite some pressure from 100-gig migrations. Virtual connections had strong adds in the quarter that we now have over 13,000 virtual connections on our ECX Fabric, supporting more than 1,300 customers. ECX Fabric functionality supports secure, high speed connections not only to cloud service providers, but between any customer on Platform Equinix, solving for a variety of IT consumption use cases. We will expand the ECX Fabric to include full inter-regional connectivity early next year. Our Internet Exchange platform also saw continued momentum with peak traffic up over 40% year-over-year. This quarter, we launched new internet exchanges in Bogot\u00e1 and Amsterdam, and now operate this service in 34 markets globally.","Now, let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical captured record new logos as regional carriers extend their global reach to support infrastructure at the edge, augmented by solid bookings from wireless operators and cable providers. Expansions included a Global 2000 Chinese telecom operator expanding their footprint in Europe to support hyperscale requirements and a Fortune 500 telecom provider upgrading to 100-gig to better serve enterprise customers. Our financial services vertical saw broad strength led by banking, insurance, and capital markets. New wins included Navy Federal Credit Union moving infrastructure to improve data management and a top 10 global stock exchange, deploying with Equinix to securely access our expansive financial ecosystem.","In content and digital media, we saw record bookings led by APAC, as digital transformation continues to accelerate. Customer expansions included several high profile wins, including both Alibaba and Tencent. Our cloud and IT vertical produced strong bookings led by Hyperscaler demand in APAC and a rapid increase in participants on ECX Fabric globally. We continue to enjoy new logo wins in this space as well, including infrastructure providers BuildCloud (10:25) and TechFlow Services.","The enterprise vertical continues to be our fastest growing vertical, recording strong bookings in new logo capture, we're seeing diversified growth across multiple sub-segments led this quarter by manufacturing, healthcare and travel, demonstrating the relevance and flexibility of interconnection oriented architectures to any type of firm undertaking digital transformation. New wins included Lenovo transforming network topology and localizing traffic to improve performance, a Fortune 100 airline transforming supply chain management, and a multinational oilfield services company connecting to the cloud via Platform Equinix.","Channel sales had another strong quarter, again contributing more than 20% of bookings and over 40% of our new logos as partners like AT&T, Telstra, Microsoft and NetApp, all mobilized their extensive go-to-market power to help extend our enterprise reach. New channel wins this quarter included a digital wealth management as a service provider that we jointly targeted with Orange Business Services winning the opportunity to provide the platform for their private cloud infrastructure in 12 countries worldwide.","Now, let me turn the call over to Keith, to cover the results for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. As highlighted by Charles, we had a solid third quarter with revenues, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share ahead of expectations and guidance. We had strong gross bookings in the quarter, our top three results for us and we delivered our highest ever quarter-over-quarter organic step up in recurring revenues. The sales pipeline remains at an all time high with a significant number of multi-market, multi-region opportunities.","Across each of our regions, MRR per cabinet yields remained firm with spot pricing improving the Americas for small to medium sized deals. Also we had net positive pricing actions in the quarter, a reflection of our value based decisioning versus simply growing for growth sake. Cross-connect additions both physical or virtual were strong and interconnection revenues continued to grow faster than the overall business. Our hyperscale activity across all deployment sizes is healthy and we're making great progress with our HIT financing initiatives.","Turning to acquisitions, we've made substantial headway with our M&A integration efforts. We're raising our annualized revenue run rate for both Infomart and Metronode to $37 million and $70 million respectively. With respect to Metronode's increased performance, we have significantly reduced the adjusted EBITDA multiple used to acquire these assets. Effectively, this acquisition is now accretive, much sooner than planned. And looking forward to 2019, we plan to open new capacity across Metronode's assets and leverage the value of our multi-city footprint in Australia.","Also, we continue to feel very good about the progress we've made with the Verizon asset purchase. While the quarterly revenues will essentially remain flat through the end of the year, largely due to the previously discussed MRR churn, we feel highly confident that the incremental capacity brought online and the strong current booking activity will return the Verizon assets to growth in 2019. Finally, as it relates to our 2018 integration costs, we're lowering the estimated cost to integrate our acquisitions to $40 million.","Now, turning to the third quarter, as depicted on slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $1.284 billion, up 9% over the same quarter last year, above the top end of our guidance range. Note, all our growth rates in this section are normalized and on a constant currency basis.","EMEA and APAC were the fastest growing regions at 14% and 13%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis followed by the Americas region at 5%. Absent the Verizon churn, the Americas business would have grown at greater than 6%, better than the broader market growth rates, reflecting the continued momentum of our substantial Americas business.","While the foreign currencies continue to put pressure on our operating results, our FX hedges are working effectively to mitigate the volatility of the U.S. dollar. Simply put, the hedged FX rates are currently higher than their current spot rates. Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $14 million negative currency impact when compared to the Q2 average FX rates and a $1 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates.","Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $613 million, up 7% over the same quarter last year and better than our expectation due to revenue flow through, timing of our operating spend and lower integration costs. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48%. Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance net of our FX hedges had a $7 million negative impact when compared to the Q2 average FX rates, and then negligible negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates.","Global Q3 AFFO was $402 million, or AFFO per share of $5.01, higher than expected. This reflects the third straight quarter we've eclipsed the $5.00 per share threshold in a quarter. Exclusive of integration costs, AFFO per share would have been $5.12. Our AFFO absorbed higher income tax expense in the quarter and increasing recurring capital expenditures. Looking forward, we expect the level of third quarter taxes to be more reflective of our normal tax burden, as the tax expense over the first two quarters benefited from deductions related to acquisitions and refinancings.","Q3 global MRR churn was 2.4%. For the year, we continue to expect 2018 MRR quarterly churn to average between 2% and 2.5%.","Turning to the regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7, the Americas region had another solid bookings quarter, both within the region and exported to the other two regions. The Americas team delivered solid revenue and adjusted EBITDA results with record high levels of small and mid-sized deals. MRR yield per cabinet remained firm due to healthy deal mix and strong interconnection performance, while absorbing the expected Verizon churn. Cabinets billing were lighter than the prior quarter due to timing of customer installations. We expect this metric to rebound in Q4.","EMEA had another strong quarter, led by our Dutch and German businesses. We continue to significantly expand across the region with 19 builds currently underway, largely driven by cloud and enterprise opportunities.","From a cost perspective, I do want to note that we're seeing higher utility prices across the EMEA markets. This cost increase is being partially offset by our utility hedges, which will roll off over the coming quarters. Our new utility hedge positions will track consistent with market movements and these increased costs are reflected in our updated guidance.","And Asia-Pacific delivered record bookings with particular strength in Singapore with key wins from the content, cloud and enterprise verticals. Cross-connect counts had a strong quarter-over-quarter step up and MRR per cabinet remained firm in this region.","Turning to our interconnection activity, we added over 6,000 cross-connects net in the quarter, which was above \u2013 and again, significant incremental port capacity. The Americas and Asia-Pacific interconnection revenues stepped up to 23% and 14%, respectively, while EMEA was 9% of our recurring revenues. From a total company perspective, interconnection revenues were 17% of total recurring revenues.","Now, looking at our capital structure, please refer to slide 8. With respect to our balance sheet, it continues to scale and remains greater than $20 billion. Our unrestricted cash balance is approximately $900 million, a decrease over the prior quarter due to capital expenditures and our quarterly cash dividend, offset in part by our operating cash flow.","Net debt leverage ratio remains at 4.3 times our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. We also accessed our ATM Program over the quarter, raising $266 million, or roughly 612,000 shares at an average price of $434 per share to fund our future investment needs. To-date, under an ATM Program, we've issued just under 1.4 million shares at an average price of approximately $450 per share. We continue to be highly supportive of this type of program as it allows us to access the market on a timely basis, recognizing our strong desire to fund the business with a balance due to both debt and equity, while working to maximize our shareholders value.","Turning to slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were $546 million, including a recurring CapEx of $55 million. We opened nine expansions this quarter, adding over 8,000 cabinets, and currently have 30 construction projects underway. Also, we purchased our Bogot\u00e1 facility as well as our Frankfurt land parcel for future campus expansion. The company has now land bank capacity across 25 markets, an almost $450 million investment to-date. Also, we now own 80 of our 200 IBXs and revenues from owned assets stepped up to 48%. We continue to expect revenues from owned assets to increase as two-thirds of our development activities will be on owned properties.","Our capital expenditures are delivering healthy growth and strong returns, as shown on the slide 10. Our 128 stabilized asset revenues grew 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, largely driven by increasing colocation and interconnection revenues. Excluding the slightly increased Americas churn this quarter and the high non-recurring revenue in Q3 of 2017, our stabilized assets would have grown at approximately 4% similar to last quarter. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 30% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.","And finally, please refer to slides 11 through 16 for our updated 2018 guidance and bridges. For the full-year 2018, we're increasing our revenue guidance by $15 million largely due to favorability from our recent acquisitions offset in part by $7 million negative currency impact. Also we're raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $9 million primarily due to lower integration costs offset in part by a $3 million negative FX impact. This guidance does imply a 9% year-over-year revenue growth rate, and a healthy adjusted EBITDA margin of 48%.","And the momentum of the business is continuing to drive both AFFO and AFFO per share growth. We're raising our 2018 as reported AFFO per share guidance approximately $20.32 per share at midpoint of guidance, or $20.82 per share excluding integration costs. Assumed a weighted average shares outstanding of 80.2 million on a fully diluted basis. AFFO is expected to grow 13% year-over-year on an as reported basis. We continue to expect our 2018 non-recurring capital expenditures to range between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion.","And finally, with respect to our cash dividends for the fourth quarter, the dividend will be $2.28 per share. For 2018, we now expect the total cash dividend payout to be about $727 million or an AFFO payout ratio of approximately 45%.","So with that, let me stop here and I'll turn it back to Charles.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Thanks, Keith. In closing, we delivered a great third quarter with strong flow through into adjusted EBITDA and AFFO and healthy metrics across the board. Today, we're the clear data center market leader and our growth, scale, and innovative product portfolio puts us in a great position to build on a business model that is truly and substantially differentiated from our peers. As we set our sights on 2019, we will focus on the six priorities outlined in my opening remarks, building upon our unparalleled global reach, interconnection and ecosystems, sharpening our focus on driving operating leverage, extending our balance sheet through HIT and enhancing our financial model with accelerated logo capture and new service innovation. These efforts all center on delivering long-term value creation and putting Platform Equinix in the pole position to power digital transformation across the globe.","So, let me stop here and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin our formal question-and-answer session. The first question is coming from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thank you. My question is mainly on HIT. It has been a couple of quarters and we've only seen about one dedicated hyper-scale development project announced in your expansions which is Paris 1. I guess, my main question is when HIT was first announced, the takeaway some investors had actually was that there'd be several announce maybe per quarter per year going forward or maybe just more than one, could you give us more color on the degree of selectivity or being around these deals or why they are not been more announced yet because it's been a couple of quarters?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, I mean there's a number of projects, we've got \u2013 I kind of think about HIT as a three-legged stool; they are sort of demand, supply and finance. And the demand side is very strong, very solid pipeline of deals. What you're speaking to is really its supply side. Paris 8 actually is our first HIT facility, I was actually out there last week, walked through the facility, it's in great shape and on track to open, I think in the next few months. So that's tracking well. And there are a number of other projects, we just have not announced them. We have a strong land bank and a number of projects underway in terms of our approvals. They just have not made their way through. And to some degree, we're not waiting on those necessarily to have the joint venture fully underway. So, there are projects underway that we're in the planning phases on, but we just have not announced those as of yet.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. Thank you for the color on them. And my next question has to do with interconnection, your EMEA MRR for cross-connect is about one-third the level of the Americas, and your APAC level is about double. Longer term, should we be assuming this MRR rate in EMEA increases as enterprises deploy hybrid clouds through the region? And maybe could we just get a sense of pricing will ever go up over the next two years just so we can start adjusting or projecting accordingly?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. Fair question and one I asked our EMEA team in our operating review. So, we absolutely ought to expect that. And so, when we did the Telecity acquisition, we talked about the fact that there was a delta there and that we believe that the unique value that our cross-connects provide to our customers justify that value. And so there's always a little more complexity than one would hope as you do those integrations and try to get that and put together and obviously some friction in the system in terms of those increases rolling through. But the short answer to your question is, yes, I think that we should continue to see that that rise as we deliver that value to our customers.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is coming from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. Two questions if I may. First of all, Charles, thank you for giving us the overview, your areas of focus to start off the call. I'm just curious though does that change any of the guidance that you guys provided at your Analyst Day earlier this year, is all that still intact even with the new areas of focus under your leadership?","And then secondly, one of the things that stuck out was the stabilized growth of 2% and I know that you mentioned Americas churn being part of the impact, the other one being the tough comps. Is the Americas churn just what's going on in Verizon or is there something else there and to that point the U.S. or Americas business just grew 5% on a year-over-year basis. And that's somewhat similar to what your typical stabilized growth is, one would assume that's actually growing faster. Can you just talk a little about what your expectations are for growth rates in the Americas on a go-forward basis. Thank you.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Sure. Lots in there, Colby. So, let me go after one at a time here. As to the priorities and whether what we talked about at our Analyst Day still holds, the answer to that is yes. So, we still are feeling good about those ranges. And then as to what it means for 2019, we're going to come back in February and give you a sense for that. So I think, we still have more work to do in terms of digging through the details of how those priorities will play out and when and how and through what means we'll make the investments in the business and that may all play into our forward year look. But right now, we still feel good about the ranges that we provided at Analyst Day.","As to stabilized asset growth, it was like quarter and as we dug into it, there's a number of \u2013 and into the underlying drivers, we don't believe that the result reflects any \u2013 really an erosion of the business fundamentals. So one, as you talked about and as we said in the script, one is a tough comp that due to again, some of the elevated NRR in Q3 of last year, the churn although it was in line with our expectations, it was a little concentrated in our stabilized assets. And so, I think that impacted \u2013 it was in line for what we expected, but it did impact the stabilized asset growth. Now, some of that being Verizon, some of that being organic, but nothing unusual in my mind. There were some specific churns in some stabilized assets associated with multi-tiered architectures coming through. But that's nothing new for us. And so, I don't see anything there that I'm overly concerned about.","So normalized for those, that would take us into this sort of 4% neighborhood. That said, 4% is below our historical norms. And I would say that we probably believe that we're going to continue to see a little bit of headwind on that metric due to a couple of factors. First, the 10-gig to 100-gig migrations tend to be concentrated in our interconnection hubs, which are almost all in the stabilized asset pool. And so, as you noticed in the stabilized asset performance, interconnection was down a little bit in that one specifically as well. And so, I think that's part of that. Now we do expect that that's going to taper over the course of 2019. It tends to start with the biggest players because they're the ones with the highest motivation and the wherewithal to do it and then it rolls from there. And so, we do think that will continue through 2019, but taper to some degree through the year.","And then secondly, we've got a handful of assets in the stabilized pool, like New York 9, which is 111 8th Avenue in New York, and then Atlanta 2, which is 56 Marietta Street in Atlanta. Both of those are sort of traditional multi-carrier telco hotels, carrier hotels and we're actively migrating customers and trying to actively shift the interconnection density from those sites to our own facilities in those markets whether that'd be Secaucus or our AT1 facility, and we view that as a critical business priority. So, we're stimulating that to happen and when we looked at this site-by-site results in a stabilized asset growth, saw that \u2013 and some of that is showing up in that. So, I do think that that's going to be more towards the low-end of kind of where we've been in that sort of 4% neighborhood.","And then the last point is the Americas. I think the Americas is an amazing business, $2.5 billion business, approaching 5,000 customers, still growing above the prevailing retail market growth despite having a drag from the Verizon business which is a business about the same size as CoreSite but dead flat. And so we said, we were going to turn that with \u2013 as churn mitigates and as we get the new expansions online, and we really feel like Verizon is going to return to growth next year and we think that will provide some lift for the Americas business, but recognizing also that the growth in that business is growing a business that is 23% interconnection and yielding almost $2,400 a cab.","So a very attractive business. I think we do have an opportunity over time. One of the priorities you heard me talk about in my six key priorities was continuing to innovate and deliver new services that we believe can have attach rates on top of our cabs (31:46). And that's something \u2013 well that's probably not going to impact the number next quarter, the quarter after. We think that's the way we can continue to get juice out of the Americas business over time. So, long question, equally long answer.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Very much appreciated. Thank you.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","The next question is coming from Jonathan Atkin, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. One for Keith, one for Charles. On HIT, do you expect to have \u2013 you talked about the financing in place in early 2019 and is that a comprehensive arrangement that would cover multiple markets or regions or single regions or would it be more like an initial arrangement to fund a discrete project or two.","And then for Charles, I wanted to drill down a little bit on the topic of parasitic tethering. In other words, when other companies pay to be within your ecosystem and then connect \u2013 they basically just leverage your ecosystem as part of their value proposition. And it's not a new issue, but given the opportunity to look at this from the fresh eyes in your new CEO seats, I wonder do you intend for Equinix to be a neutral platform fully open to all partners no matter how they leverage your ecosystem or are the competitive dynamics such that you would be more selective about your partnering relationships with resellers, carriers, peering providers and so forth. Thanks.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Great. Great questions, Jonathan. Do you want to take the HIT first?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. So, let me take the first one, Jonathan. As it relates \u2013 as Charles said, it's a three legged stool. We absolutely have the demand as it relates to HIT. We also absolutely have the potential financing partners and the opportunity to finance, and so it's making sure we develop the supply on an appropriate basis. That supply is going to come in multiple markets, as you probably can appreciate. And Jim Smith and his leadership team are working hard to continue to develop assets that can be discretely placed off balance sheet versus on balance sheet. As you're aware, Jonathan, we do some of our work, already, on balance sheet. We referred to, last quarter, London 9 and 10 as an example where we've got hybrid facilities and HIT deployments that have moved into those assets.","But what we want to make sure as we look forward, we want to have \u2013 we want to line up our financing partners with the same type of ideology that we have on how to fund the business. And so, that might mean that we have discrete partners in different markets of the world and, in some cases, we might have a regional partner, a JV partner. Rest assured, Jim, Charles and I as well as others are working hard with our financial partners to identify the opportunities, but recognize that this is something that we'll share more with you as we get further down the road. But suffice it to say there is the opportunity, there is the demand, and there will be the supply, and we feel very, very good about our HIT business as it stands today.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","And Jonathan, I think (34:42), but I think your question was a little bit about might that first JV \u2013 is that first JV likely to be some sort of \u2013 is it going to be comprehensive or regionally focused or what? I would expect it's more likely that we will pick one off that has a particular scope to it and that we will prove that out in terms of a partner in terms that we find acceptable. What I've been telling the team internally here is we've designed the mousetrap, now we got to catch the mouse. And so, I think we'll go catch one in the first quarter that may, in fact, be one that has a more contained scope, and then we would potentially add to that from there. That's certainly a possible scenario in terms of outcomes.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","And then, as to the second question on tethering, very interesting question. And you're right; it's not a new one. But I'm going to go to the end of your question first and simply say that, yes, we believe that continuing to be a neutral party that drive \u2013 and an aggregator of traffic continues to be the sort of value creating strategy for the business. Having said that, I also think that it's fair for us to get a return on our investment \u2013 our substantial investment that we've made to build the ecosystems at scale inside of our facilities. And so, call it a tax, call it a toll, call it what you will, but as appropriate when people are tethering in to gain access to that value, we'll price our services appropriately to get a return on the investment that we and our shareholders have made. And so, I think that's perfectly appropriate for the business.","We will make sure that people can access infrastructure across \u2013 from their facilities into ours when that's appropriate, and a lot of our hyperscale customers, for example, do that aggressively and we embrace that and want them to continue to be able to do that. Carrier customers who are delivering value across the ecosystem, we want to embrace that and continue to empower and enable them. But providers who are directly competitive and saying, basically, you can get cheaper services, but the ecosystem value of Equinix, that's something where, again, we want to maintain an open posture, but we also believe that we should be fairly rewarded for the investment and the value we've put into that ecosystem. So, that's kind of our posture relative to that topic.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Next question is coming from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. Charles, just on the six priorities, coming back to something was talked about earlier, some of them like expanding go to market evolving product, it sounds like it's one of these invest to grow opportunities. Can you just scale it? Are we talking about something material here, or is this going to be fairly much within the run rate?","And then, Keith, can you just go into the leverage on the ATM. Are you trying to get down to the four times leverage in the kind of 12 months to 18 months, or are you comfortable, for now, in the low fours? Thanks.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Simon. So hitting the first one, yeah, if you read the priorities, there are definitely some of those where we use words like expand and invest, and augment, and it takes dollars to do those things. And so, what I think we're going through the process of now, as any company should, is saying, okay, what are our priorities as a company, what resources are available to us, how do we stack rank those, and to the extent we can self-fund those investment priorities, we will seek to do that.","At the same time, if we believe there are areas where we need to make investments, we'll look at doing that and figure out what the appropriate means of doing that is. And I think, sometimes, those might be OpEx dollars and sometimes those might be CapEx dollars. And so, we're really sorting through all of that, and I think really won't have, I think, the details on that until we sort of go into the full 2019 plan, and solidify that; and, we'll share that with you in February.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Simon, just maybe \u2013 just adding on to what Charles has said, it's not like we haven't been investing in our go to market and new product initiatives as well. And so, it's a continued expansion of the decisions that we've made previously. And under Charles' leadership, what we're going to do is really focus in and emphasize the areas of investment. And so, I just want you to feel comfortable that a lot of it is in our run rate; does not mean that we will not make sizable investments. That'll be something we'll determine at the time as we size the opportunity in front of us. But the point that we really need to make is we are a different company. We have a point of differentiation and we're going to invest around that as being the global interconnection provider with all the different products and services that get attached to that.","Having said that, and going to your second question, which is really important on going back to the ATM, the use of the ATM and our leverage posture, we still as a company have a very balanced view on making sure that we raise both debt and equity as appropriate. As you're also aware we generate a lot of cash flow as reflected in our AFFO metric. So as a business just naturally with our growth we're going to de-lever. I think \u2013 not I think, when we talked to you at the Analyst Day we said a few things. Number one, revenue was going to grow 8% to 10%. FFO was going to grow 8% to 12% within those ranges over the period through 2022.","And that was reflective of an environment where at times it might be at the lower end of the range and from an AFFO perspective to reflect funding requirements when we do a discrete funding, whether it's debt or equity. And so, our view is that we're going to grow revenue, we're going to grow our EBITDA margin and we're going to fund roughly $10 billion of capital as well as a growing cash dividend. And with that will require us to raise some additional capital. We will always have a balanced view to raising that capital with a posture of we want to get to investment grade and we think we can get there in a reasonable timeframe, under just current course and speed and being mindful about where we raise our capital and how we grow our business. And my belief is that that's something that can happen on a reasonably short time period. Whether you think 12 to 24 months is reasonable, that's what I think is reasonable, getting to investment grade while you're deleveraging the business because of growth.","But overall, we are going to bring balance into our capital structure and the impact of AFFO this quarter was roughly $0.05 with the shares that we raised on an AFFO per share basis and about $0.11 for the year. And so we want to continue to make sure we balance that, we think about it in our forward guide with the debt and the equity and we'll continue to update you accordingly as we raise more capital for our future growth opportunities.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is coming from Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you and good afternoon. I think last quarter on this call you talked about an MRR step-up in the second half of 2018, that was expected to materialize and I'm curious, is that going to step-up to a greater degree in the fourth quarter or was there a mitigating factor in the third quarter that you would point to?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. Jordan, first and foremost, when you look at the MRR step-up, again we had the highest incremental organic step-up this quarter in Q3. As I look forward to the guide for Q4, we're using a guidance range of roughly $10 million on a revenue basis. If you look at the midpoint taking into consideration the midpoint or if you even take it up more to the higher end of the range, you'll see that there is another meaningful step-up in recurring revenue because we're actually, we're guiding, we're probably going to take $2 million out of the quarter-over-quarter increase in non-recurring revenue. Or said differently, Q4 non-recurring revenue will be that or will be below that of Q3 non-recurring revenue. So we're seeing a meaningful step-up in Q4 recurring revenue as well.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And was that specifically with regard to the Americas, I know you mentioned cabs billing there seemed to be a little bit of a timing issue there with a rebound to come?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Well, certainly the Americas as Charles alluded, I think we're having great success in the business and we'll continue to grow. But frankly speaking, you've got 13% and 14% organic growth in the other two regions on a sort of organic, normalized and constant currency basis, so a lot of that growth, more than 50% of our business resides outside the U.S. now and so the majority of the growth will come from outside of the U.S.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","The next question is coming from Philip Cusick, JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan","Hey, guys. Two for Keith. Keith, can you expand and quantify the impact of the utility hedges? How has the green power initiative impacted this and what should we expect for 2019? And then, also as you think about HIT fundraising, are there structures that you ruled out at this point or is everything still on the table? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Great. As it relates to utility hedges, one of the things I just want to share with you and probably no surprise to anybody, there's regulated and unregulated markets and the regulated market is very little we can do. As it relates to the unregulated markets, we put hedges in place and we're always looking at buying forward in anticipation of future consumption, not only what we consume today but what we think we will consume tomorrow. And so, just make the underlying assumptions that we're always putting hedges in place appropriately and hedging out roughly 70% of our exposure. Again markets are volatile and so we want to always let something float.","As it relates to green initiative, again we've invested heavily in alternative sources of energy. As you're aware, whether it's solar or wind or otherwise, we're making sure that we stick to our commitment of becoming carbon neutral as it relates to our consumption. And frankly, that's costing us money today. And the order of magnitude is roughly $10 million a year and that's an investment we've made this year. It was in our guidance, but it reflects that there is a need to become more green. It's a demand of our customers and a requirement as table stakes I would argue and therefore, we've made an investment.","Now, certainly there's dynamics in \u2013 what we call our prior purchase arrangements with our service providers. It's going to fluctuate year-over-year depending on market conditions and the prevailing price of power on a kilowatt basis. But, this year, we are making an investment and we will continue to make investments, all else being equal. But, power is a relatively important one. It's a relatively \u2013 it's our largest variable component. It represents between sort of 11.5% and about 12.2% of our revenue depending on the quarter and so, of course, it's a meaningful mountain and if you think about a 10 basis point move, that's $5 million a year.","So that's something that we pay very close attention to and with rising rates, some of it we can pass through to our customers, some of them unfortunately we consume ourselves. That is a higher cost and we have to find other ways to mitigate the exposure associated with higher utility prices.","And so, we're doing that as a business and again, under the leadership of Charles and our team, we're focused very highly in making sure we can offset some of these incremental costs with other ways of running the business more efficiently, including making sure we also have incremental hedges put in place as appropriate.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan","Thank you.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","So, sorry, (47:00) was just reminding me of the second question which was HIT structures. I think all structures are still on the table quite frankly. We're working with different partners. As Charles alluded back that he met partner last week in Europe, there's partners in Asia, certainly partners all throughout the U.S. and elsewhere, in North America. And so we'll continue to look at sort of the best structure for ourselves and of course our partner to reflect on whatever the best outcome is. But right now, it'd probably look more like a JV structure than anything else. But I think it just depends on the level of supply that we create and over what period of time. And that will determine if there's other ways that we would approach it such as fund \u2013 a JV structure versus a fund structure versus something maybe different.","And recognizing, one of the first thing that we might do is, we do it on balance sheet. Sometimes we can't get it off balance sheet, there's very discrete reasons or is the hybrid facility. And again, we're going to make sure it's the highest and best use of our capital but we want to move most of this off balance sheet if we can, as we continue to get some momentum here on the billings side. We'll start to break out some of those details for you in the future, but it's not material enough right now in our results to adjust, but certainly as we get into 2019 and certainly 2020, I think it will be more of a discussion that we'll be having on this subject.","Operator","The next question is coming from Aryeh Klein, BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Aryeh Klein - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. EMEA has been a strong market for you and you have a lot of additional capacity plan there. Can you describe your visibility into demand for those additions? And then Charles earlier in your six priorities you talked a little bit about adding new services, can you may be provide a bit more color on what those might be?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Sure. So starting with EMEA, and I would say this is true across the board. As we look at Q4 and into next year and one of the things that we've really improved over the last couple of years is our forward visibility on the pipe and used to be that we struggled beyond the next quarter. But I think we've really enhanced that and driven the sales discipline to have better visibility into the pipeline. And I think we have strong pipeline across all three regions. EMEA does have a really strong supply pipeline in terms of capacity and the projects and the investments that we're making there and again that business has performed very well.","EMEA has a little bit of a different mix. It has a slightly higher \u2013 large footprint mix. It's a bit of a different market in a number of ways, but that business continues to perform very well and deliver solid returns and we expect that that will continue into 2019 and beyond.","Relative to the new services, I think there's a variety of things, at the interconnection layer, ECX Fabric will continue to add the inter-regional element to ECX Fabric. That product is growing ahead of its business case, in terms of both circuits, ports, virtual circuits, revenue and so we feel very good about that business. We have talked about other augments to our business in terms of delivering things in the area of network function virtualization and services that we might be able to easily deliver sort of best-in-class virtualized functions to our customers as add-on services to our performance hub type implementations. And so that's something that we are partnering with some very large players to bring forward and we think that we'll not only be able to bring their solutions, which our customers are demanding, but we'll be able to some degree mobilize their channel on our behalf which we're very excited about.","And then beyond that, I think there is a set of investments that we in services, in terms of how we can make our platform a more accessible, more easier to use, higher value-added digital transformation platform and that I won't be overly precise here in terms of what exactly that looks like, but simply to say I think there are a number of things we can do to make it easier for service providers, for example, to view platform Equinix as a place where they can deliver their value to end customers. And a place where enterprise customers can consume that value more effectively. So some ways it is going to be about ease of use API, developer toolkits, those kind of things that really make the platform more accessible. So stay tuned and I think that will be an ongoing investment for us over the coming years.","Aryeh Klein - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is coming from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Your line is open.","Erik Peter Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. First, circling back on the HIT initiative. You commented that the pipeline is healthy, but can you maybe give us a little bit more depth on the level of activity you're seeing and how that compares to your prior expectations. Any sort of like metrics that you can provide to help us better understand that opportunity?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. I won't quantify it specifically other than to say that we have \u2013 we probably have way more demand in the pipeline than we would be able to or want to satisfy. And so, as you guys know, our posture relative to the large footprint hyperscaler demand is that, it is something that we want to participate in because we believe is accretive to our premium retail strategy. And so, we'll be selective about participating there. You know in the right assets, we'll put in \u2013 once we get the HIT assets, once we get the JV structured and we might have more balance sheet firepower that doesn't create opportunity cost in our retail business, we may step up the level of aggression. But right now, I would say that we're going to be selective about that business and again there's, right now, way more demand that that hyperscale community would like to work with us on than we probably have the ability to do. So, we'll continue to work with them. We'll prioritize projects based on their needs and then based on what fits for us and we'll try to select and build facilities to take the right kinds of business.","I would also just highlight that our relationship with hyperscalers go well beyond the large footprint. And as you can recall in my Analyst Day presentation, I showed you that that's a $0.5 billion a year business with hyperscalers today and growing at a highly over-indexed rate relative to the rest of our business. And two-thirds of that is really below the retail \u2013 is really retail business and highly interconnected, both on the A side and the Z side. And so, we're going to continue to push that pedal down on that side of the hyperscaler business with every bit of energy and effort that we can. And then, on hyperscale's large footprint side, we'll be selective, and then probably step things up as the JVs come to bear.","Erik Peter Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And maybe just as my follow-up, regarding Verizon, now that we're coming to the end of the year and you've been able to make progress on investing into that business bringing those assets up to par, what are your growth expectations for next year? Have you been \u2013 have you seen any significant improvements that might have altered your thoughts on that business? I guess, I'm just trying to understand what you mean by return to growth, at this point.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","One of the things we said previously that you should expect it to grow at or above our stabilized asset growth, again, it's going to be very specific to the decisions we make. As you know, we sell across the platform. And we think \u2013 if you look at the Verizon assets in a very discrete way, that's one way to look at it. We actually don't look at it that way. We look across our entire portfolio. But it's fair to say that we would likely see it growing at a stabilized asset level or better, but we also want to make sure we manage our inventory in a very positive way and push the customers to highest and best use principles in the right IBXs with the right applications.","And what I would just say...","Erik Peter Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","One other thing I'd just say, this quarter we had a slight increase in \u2013 if you look at (55:46) which you can't see it anymore, we've fully integrated the business, but the Verizon assets moved up this quarter \u2013 sorry \u2013 the Verizon revenue increased this quarter over last quarter. Part of it was for \u2013 there's some non-recurring activity as well. But we are starting to see the stabilization of the base, again, recognizing that \u2013 we acquired the business and we grew it substantially, but originally, when this asset was acquired and the 8-K that we filed when we did the transaction, as you know there was a deterioration in revenue associated with the asset prior to our ownership. We've been able to stabilize it. We're investing in the core assets. We're integrating to our standards and we're investing in both physical assets and human capital assets across the portfolio, and we think we're making a tremendous difference. As we step back, we are absolutely delighted with the acquisition and how it's performing.","Clearly, we like revenue to continue to step up and the turn to abate. We think that is realistically going to happen because the gross booking activity inside the portfolio of assets is strong. And so, now that we have a strong portfolio, once we can get the turn to abate and continue to make our investments, I think \u2013 it's my belief that you'll see the Verizon assets grow nicely on a go-forward basis.","Erik Peter Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is coming from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Just a couple of questions. First, on the development side, if we look at the schedule and where cabinets are coming from, it looks like with some of the facilities that were turned on in the third quarter, the amount of development in the Americas as well as in Asia has fallen off significantly. And just curious if that's just sort of a temporary slow of what's been announced, and if that actually should get better and how to think about development growth in the Americas and Asia-Pac over the next couple of years.","And then, secondly, on the sales pipeline that you described, are you seeing a shift in where the pipeline is coming from and \u2013 with respect to enterprise versus cloud versus networks? And maybe a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the sell side, maybe how much is direct versus indirect et cetera. Thanks.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Sure. So development pipeline first, I do think that what we tend to find is things sort of come in waves. And so, I think we saw that we're in the midst of a European sort of capacity wave. I think that if you look at the broader and deeper pipeline, I think that does tend to start to balance out a little bit more. Although, again, as Keith said earlier, when the other two regions are growing at 13% and 14%, respectively, those are probably going to take on more of the development dollars over time. So I think you will see some balancing of that, because there's also meaningful investments that we'll make in the Americas, as we talked about, sort of the Infomart master plan there in Dallas and those kind of things.","So I think you'll see some balancing of that. But again, we feel like we've got opportunities across the regions, but the growth is more substantial in EMEA and APAC.","As to the pipeline, again, good performance across our verticals, and we continue to see it in virtually every segment. The pipeline is at its high in terms of historically, and so \u2013 I would say one thing on the networks. Networks \u2013 one, we're seeing both continued sell-to demand, meaning they're \u2013 as they sort of reorient their networks towards a cloud world and continue to invest in those, and then also, wireless continues to be a strong segment for us.","But network, we're seeing a lot of sell-through business as well to the enterprise. And so, certainly a portion of our network pipeline is actually aimed at the enterprise. And so, we tried to characterize that internally here. And right now, I would say that the enterprise pipeline, when you look at everything that we're selling both through our NSP partners and other partners alongside our strategic alliance partners, and directly with our enterprise selling team, is a really strong market that's over-indexing materially relative to the overall pipe.","And again, our motion right now, though, is even our channel motion is largely a sell with motion. And so, it's not yet a really true fully empowered indirect channel that's going to bring those things to market on \u2013 bring offers to market on its own. We believe there's a way to change that and simplify it and skew things more effectively into the channel, and that's a priority for us to try to make that happen. And I think we could accelerate things if we can do that. But right now, the channel is working a little bit more as a sell with, but really bringing a strong new logo demand because of their position with the customer decision makers.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And our last question is coming from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Maybe a question on the other acquisitions. Can you give us a sense on how Metronode and Infomart are progressing? And any color you can provide on the upside to guidance driven by those deals, whether it's on the revenue side or on the cost side? Thanks.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, John. I mean, in our prepared remarks, we actually talked about the performance of both Infomart and Metronode and the fact that we're stepping up the revenues. In fact, the performance of Metronode and our ability to integrate these assets more efficiently and at speed than previously anticipated has allowed us to turn it from a deal that was going to be accretive after a period of time to being accretive immediately.","And so, we're seeing performance and part of the reason you're seeing the step up in revenue guidance, again we took revenues up $15 million this quarter before the currency dilution. That's because of the acquisitions. So bottom-line is we're delighted, that when we buy these businesses, integrate them into our run rate or platform. And then, as Charles alluded to in the case of Infomart, which is more an asset purchase have started to develop the master plan associated with that acquisition and the available land, that puts us in a very good position relative to where we originally were.","Still, a lot of work to do. No surprise, but we're integrating all the assets and we had eight integrations underway this year and we're almost through them all. Does not mean there won't be a little bit of work to do next year, but by and large, we're taking down our integration cost. We're at the tail end of it and we just have to tidy up some things as we go into 2019, but we're in a very good position.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.","Thank you. That concludes our Q3 earnings call. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","This will conclude today's conference.

Good afternoon and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and maybe affected by the risks we identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 22, 2019, and 10-Q filed on November 1, 2019.","Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call.

Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call within an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow on questions to just one.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.","Charles Meyers","Thanks Kat. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call.","We had a strong finish to 2019 and the momentum within the team and across the business is clearly evident, reflecting solid execution of our strategy and indicative of the tremendous opportunity in front of us. We closed over 17,000 deals in 2019, demonstrating the extraordinary scale of our retail go-to-market engine and the differentiated nature of the Equinix value proposition.","The pace of digital transformation continues to accelerate, creating seismic shifts across industries as businesses embrace interconnection as critical to their infrastructure strategy and adopt hybrid and multi-cloud as the clear architecture of choice.","The secular forces driving demand for digital infrastructure are as strong as ever. Data is being created, moved, analyzed and stored at unprecedented levels. These dynamics are expanding the Equinix addressable market as customers seek to distribute infrastructure globally.","Responding to increasingly demanding workloads and the need to locate and interconnect private infrastructure in close proximity to a rapidly expanding universe of cloud-based resources. Against this backdrop, we continue to focus on four critical vectors to position the business for significant value creation in 2020 and beyond.","As it always does, it starts with our people. We will continue to invest, first, in our people, our organization and our culture in order to attract and inspire market-leading talent and service to one another, enabling us collectively to be in service to our customers, to our shareholders and to the communities in which we operate.","Second, we will continue to evolve and grow our go-to-market engine, targeting the right customers with the right workloads in the right locations. Amplifying our reach via the channel and ensuring that our sales and service delivery capabilities, continue to be globally aligned and locally responsive.","Third, we will continue to invest in Platform Equinix, expanding our global reach, while also adding new services and capabilities that will allow customers to more flexibly combine Equinix value with that of our partners to more quickly implement hybrid and multi-cloud architectures at the digital edge.","And fourth, we will focus on simplifying and scaling our business, implementing our own targeted digital transformation initiatives focused on increasing operating leverage and enhancing our customer experience.","These areas of focus and our long-term orientation will allow us to widen the mode around our business, enhance our yields and increase service attach rates, enabling us to deliver durable revenue growth and attractive AFFO per share.","Expanding our reach remains a core tenet, and we now operate across 55 metros in 26 countries. As we recently closed our Mexico acquisition and will open new markets this year including Hamburg and Muscat.","The benefit of our unparalleled reach is reflecting in strong cross regional activity, which continues to trend positively with multi-metro customer revenues ticking up 87%. We also continue to make significant progress with our hyperscale strategy, with six announced projects underway across all three regions, and a strong pipeline of customer demand.","We are already looking to expand our European JV and advancing additional JV conversations in Japan and other targeted geographies. This strategy will enable us over time to extend our leadership in the cloud ecosystem, while mitigating strain on our balance sheet and maintaining market-leading returns.","Turning to our results as depicted on Slide 3. Revenues for the full year were $5.6 billion, up 9% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA was up 10% year-over-year and AFFO was meaningfully ahead of our expectations for the year Interconnection revenues grew 14% year-over-year, driven by strong customer response to the Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric, good traction in our new Internet exchange markets and solid interconnection adds. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis.","Our interconnection differentiation continues to pay dividends as we expand our product set, driving growth and customer value. We now have over 363,000 interconnections and delivered our 12th consecutive quarter of adding more interconnections than the rest of the top 10 competitors combined.","In Q4, we added an incremental 7,400 interconnections fueled by high gross adds to support new streaming services, expanding inter-metro connections and seasonably lower churn. Peak Internet exchange traffic grew by 10% this quarter, also helped by these new OTT video offerings. ECX Fabric is diversifying well as an exchange platform, with over 2,000 customers now connecting their own deployments to over 600 other participants on the platform.","Our longer-term vision for Platform Equinix continues to take shape, influenced by direct feedback from our customers and partners. Our Network Edge offering, which provides customers' access to a number of different virtual network functions provisioned over ECX Fabric is tracking ahead of plan.","And our announced acquisition of Packet represents a bold move to accelerate our strategy to help enterprises quickly and seamlessly deploy hybrid multi-cloud architectures on Platform Equinix.","By combining Packet's market leading hardware automation capabilities with our platform and integrating directly with the ECX Fabric, we intend to create a world-class enterprise grade bare metal offering that allows customers to rapidly deploy digital infrastructure at the edge with differentiated performance and robust integration to the public cloud. We expect the Packet transaction to close in Q1 and look forward to updating you further on progress of our platform strategy.","Now let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our Network vertical achieved solid bookings with robust reseller activity from our global NSP partners as well as continued expansion activity across various networks sub segments. New wins include RTI Connectivity, a leading subsea cable operator, extending their solutions in Tokyo and Sydney.","We also launched an expanded partnership with Telstra enabling full API integration with ECX Fabric giving enterprise customers on-demand access to Telstra services across 38 metros. A good example of how we're automating connectivity with key partners to their last mile networks via the ECX fabric.","Our financial services vertical achieved its third highest bookings led by capital markets providers and large multinationals as cloud adoption accelerates. New wins included a top three Nordic Bank, re-architecting their global network for digital payments and a Fortune 500 financial advisory firm, transforming their network topology.","Our content and digital media vertical saw record bookings, led by APAC and strength in gaming, publishing and e-commerce as cloud adoption continues to shape this vertical. Expansions included a Fortune 500 media company expanding to launch new OTT delivery services and a multinational conglomerate building out its edge to support growing multiplayer online gaming in South America.","Our cloud and IT vertical saw strong bookings led by APAC and double-digit growth in services and infrastructure as cloud customers diversify. Equinix continues to be the clear global leader in cloud connectivity, with over 40% share of total cloud on-ramps and 15 new on-ramps added in 2019, 5 times the nearest competitor.","Our enterprise vertical saw healthy and high quality new logo adds with continued strength in manufacturing, healthcare and retail as enterprises build out hybrid architectures. New wins included a Fortune 150 retailer, building out infrastructure to support digital transformation and a global life sciences firm, enabling multi-cloud capabilities.","Our channel accounted for more than 27% of bookings and we are very pleased with the progress we made in building this important go-to-market vector. Two-thirds of our channel bookings are now driven by resellers, with integrated solutions like Performance Hub and ECX Fabric, delivering faster and more predictable order flow.","We're working together with these resellers to more effectively prioritize join offerings to bring mutual customers the benefits of Platform Equinix, enhanced by our partner services. New channel wins this quarter included a win with Telindus for the city of Amsterdam, as well as a win with Optus to support Children's Cancer Institute of Australia with data analytics for genomics research, highlighting how with partners we are truly better together and reminding us of the far reaching impact Platform Equinix in helping make the world a better and healthier place.","Now let me turn the call over to Keith, to cover the results for the quarter.","Keith Taylor","Thank you, Charles. Good afternoon to everyone.","As highlighted by Charles, what a great way to end the year, and an even better way to start a new one, very similar to last year. We delivered $5.6 billion of revenues and as reported increase of slightly under $500 million, compared to last year. We're at 9% year-over-year growth rate on a normalized and constant currency basis. AFFO per share scaled to $22.81 and as reported year-over-year increase of greater than 10% better than our expectations as we drive value on both the top line and at the per share level.","Our core strategy, our go-to-market engine and our team are delivering performance at a very high level as we continue to separate ourselves from our competitors. And our strong fourth quarter performance sets us up nicely to invest in growing and scaling the business in 2020.","We continue to fund organic expansion and new product and services initiatives, while also scaling our go-to-market efforts, these investments are directly attributable to the volume of high quality interconnection rich wins across both our direct and indirect channels.","Our MRR per cabinet metric remained strong, largely due to solid pricing discipline, favorable deal mix and positive interconnection momentum. We have an active construction pipeline, expanding our global platform with 32 projects currently underway across 23 metros in 15 countries.","We'll leverage our recently achieved investment grade credit rating to reduce our future debt service burden, has initially demonstrated by our fourth quarter $2.8 billion debt raise to favorably refinance a portion of our outstanding high yield debt. Our financial strength remains a significant and strategic advantage.","Now let me cover the quarterly highlights. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, the global Q4 revenues were $1.417 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year, our 17th year of consecutive quarterly revenue growth, a trend that we expect to continue as we look into 2020.","We had our second best gross and net booking quarter, largely due to strong organic performance coupled with net positive pricing actions again, and then some delayed churn. Q4 revenues, net of our FX hedges included a $4 million positive FX benefit due to the stronger euro and British pound in the quarter, when compared to our prior guidance rates.","Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $676 million, up 9% over the same quarter last year and better than expected due to lower than anticipated employee costs and utilities expense. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges included a positive $1 million FX benefit, when compared to our prior guidance rates.","Global Q4 AFFO was $473 million, above our expectations on a constant currency basis, while absorbing the seasonally higher recurring CapEx investments similar to last year. Interconnection revenues were very strong across all three regions this quarter, reflecting the benefit of our global platform and diversified product portfolio.","Interconnection revenues now represent 18% of recurring revenues, a significant quarter-over-quarter step up. The Americas and EMEA interconnection revenues are now 24% and 10% of recurring revenues, respectively, while APAC stepped up to 15%, a meaningful increase throughout the year.","Turning to regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. APAC and EMEA were the fastest MRR growing regions at 13% and 12% respectively on a year-over-year normalized basis, followed by the Americas region at 4%.","The Americas region saw continued strong bookings both local and export with their high mix of small deals and healthy pricing, and the Dallas market has been a highlight for the Americas business, we've seen healthy performance with our existing Infomart asset and we're eager to complete our new build adjacent to the Infomart, which will be known as Dallas 11, and we closed the Axtel acquisition in Mexico in January, and have already received favorable inbound queries from multinational and carrier communities. We're eager to start our expansion efforts in Mexico, thereby, enhancing our interconnection opportunities between North, Central and South America.","Looking forward, we expect Americas revenue growth to trend upward to 5% or greater, as we progress through 2020. Our EMEA region saw a continued growth throughout 2019, largely driven by our four largest markets Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris, as multinationals deploy their infrastructure across these major regional hubs.","EMEA, again, had robust billable cabinet additions and firm deal pricing, as reflected in our solid MRR per cabinet metric. Export bookings continued to remain high across the region and for the first time ever EMEA export bookings were greater than their import bookings, a reflection of the continued globalization of our go-to-market activities. And Asia-Pacific region, saw record bookings with an uptick in small deal activity and strength in our Australian markets.","Also, our investments in new markets like Seoul are progressing well, and we're starting to see the front edge of a new ecosystem developing as key domestic NSPs deploy their infrastructure into these assets.","And now, looking at the capital structure. Please refer to Slide 8. At year-end, our unrestricted cash balance was approximately $1.9 billion, which included about $344 million of cash that was used in January, to redeem the remaining portion of the debt refinance, in November, 2019.","Our net debt leverage ratio was 3.7 times at Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA, within our targeted range. We continue to expect to drive substantial interest savings into our AFFO per share metric, as we refinance our currently outstanding debt over the next 12 months, taking advantage of current market conditions. As you would expect the Nashville trade-off will be the cost attributed to the call premium or make whole provision offset by the present value of the future interest savings.","Of course, we want to make each of these transactions net present value positive, while negotiating the best terms and conditions for the business. To be clear, there is no benefit attributed from our future refinancings in the current AFFO per share guidance.","Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $715 million, including recurring CapEx of $81 million, we opened nine new expansion projects in the fourth quarter, including new IBXs in Melbourne, Singapore and Sydney, while we added another 13 projects for expansion tracking sheet. This gives you a sense of the level of activity in the business and the speed that we're building in filling capacity.","We continue to expand our ownership acquiring additional land for development in Frankfurt and purchasing - and we purchased our Toronto 2 IBX, revenues from owned assets increased to 55%. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10.","Our 136 stabilized asset increased recurring revenues by 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, while total stabilized asset revenue grew 2% due to lower non-recurring revenues this quarter versus the prior year. We expect our stabilized asset growth rate to trend up to 3% to 4% in 2020. And similar to prior years, we'll update the stabilized assets summary on the Q1 earnings call.","Our stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 30% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And please refer to slides 11 through 15 for our summary of 2020 guidance and bridges. Do note our 2020 guidance includes the anticipated financial results from the Axtel acquisition, but does not include any financial results related to the pending Packet acquisition.","Starting with revenues, we expect to deliver an 8% to 9% growth rate for 2020, delivering over $6 billion in revenue, a reflection of the continued momentum in the business and the opportunity that we see in front of us. Our 2020 revenue guidance includes $18 million to $22 million of revenue attributed to Axtel and MRR churn is expected to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter for the year. Pardon me.","We expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins of 48%, including integration - sorry excluding integration costs the result of strong operating leverage in the business, offset in part by expected higher utilities and property tax expense and a meaningful investment in our go-to-market and product organizations.","Also we expect to incur $10 million of integration costs in 2020, to finalize the integration of the various acquisitions. 2020 AFFO is expected to grow 11% to 14% compared to the previous year and our AFFO per share will grow 9% to 11%, excluding any benefit attributed to future refinancing activities. And we expect our 2020 cash dividends to increase to approximately $912 million, a 10% increase over the prior year or an 8% increase on a per share basis.","So let me stop here. I'll turn the call back to Charles.","Charles Meyers","Thanks Keith.","In closing, 2019 was a great year for Equinix. We took significant strides and continue to execute effectively on the ambitious agenda we outlined to you at our Analyst Day in 2018, positioning the business to effectively scale and capture the enormous opportunity ahead. We dramatically scaled our go-to-market machine to capture the rapidly growing enterprise opportunity, we embarked on a broad change agenda to drive consistent global execution, we added significant talent to respond to the technology shift shaping our industry, including two outstanding additions to our Board in Sandra Rivera from Intel and Adaire Fox-Martin from SAP.","And as we undertook these changes, we communicated tirelessly and engaged our teams around the globe to be a part of rearchitecting our collective future together, achieving record levels of employee engagement, market leading organizational health scores and being recognized as a global leader and sustainability.","We aggressively worked the balance sheet side of the business raising more than $4.5 billion in debt and equity, and achieved an investment grade credit status. We delivered on our commitment to form a hyperscale JV, joining forces with a world-class partner to advance our cloud aspirations, while avoiding undue strain on our balance sheet. And the market is taking notice, as we were recently recognized by IDC MarketScape, as the top leader in their inaugural worldwide colocation and interconnection vendor assessment.","In 2020, we'll continue our focus on evolving Platform Equinix, adding new capabilities and service offerings to better meet the digital transformation needs of our customers. We'll continue to scale our global multi-channel sales engine to support growing bookings and will focus on providing a more seamless and globally consistent digital experience for our customers to improve the adoption and consumption of Platform Equinix.","I am as excited as ever about the future of Equinix, an honored to work with our dedicated teams around the world in service for our customers, to our communities and to our shareholders. So let me stop there and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jon Atkin with RBC. Your line is now open.","Jon Atkin","Thanks very much. I wanted to ask an operational question and then a question about xScale. So on the operational side, I wondered if you could call out any trends that you saw around sales cycles lengthening or shortening closing rates? Any different than what you've seen in book-to-bill that is any different from what you've seen historically?","Charles Meyers","Sure, Jon, I'll take the first one and maybe - first couple and maybe you can comment on book-to-bill. In terms of win rates in sales cycles, I wouldn't say any meaningful change. I do think, maybe, we're getting a bit better I think that our targeting of the enterprise in the enterprise space in particular continues to improve. I think, we're probably seeing perhaps some shortening of sales cycles, but there is still - I think we're still fairly early in terms of customers thinking through their long-term, hybrid multi-cloud architectures.","And so, oftentimes, they are - they do continue to be longer sales cycles. Once landed, I definitely think we're seeing a shortening in terms of their ability to expand their wallet share or us expand wallet share with the customers.","And then win rates, I think are probably pretty stable if anything I think going up, we are - we're again we're doing a really nice job I think of targeting. I think our value proposition continues to resonate with customers. And overall, we've been very pleased with the performance of the go-to-market engine.","Keith Taylor","Jon I just want to mention of the book-to-bill. There is no meaningful change in our book-to-bill, in fact, as Charles said, once we land them, we tend to move very fast to install the customer. But what I would tell you is no surprise when you look at our - this quarter relative to - Q4 relative to the Q1. The timing of different events causes us to report our revenue slightly differently. So the timing of, when you booked something versus when you might churn.","And so, as an organization, I think we're seeing exactly - as is happening exactly as we planned. But there is no meaningful shift in what I call the book-to-bill interval in the business.","Jon Atkin","And then one more operational question just in terms of churn. And as you look at 2020, are there any influences this coming year different than we saw in 2019 related to customer migrations or really anything else?","Charles Meyers","No, I would say it's pretty, pretty linear sort of extrapolation of what we saw last year. I think some of the pressure for example on stabilized asset growth is coming from the fact that there is some level of cloud substitution, that's something I've talked about before, but it's really a matter of - I think people kind of really figuring out what their workload sort of distribution is going to be between private and public infrastructure and making those adjustments.","But as we said, we've been able to comfortably kind of live within the 2% to 2.5% range and we continue to feel comfortable with that going forward.","Jon Atkin","And then my xScale question is, just any sense around timing, around JV arrangements outside of Europe and how they might differ structurally from what you have in place already? And then for xScale Europe JV that's already in place, how do we think about the impact on AFFO per share?","Charles Meyers","Yes. I'll let Keith take the latter. But the - in terms of timing, we've learned not to draw too brighter line, because the complexities associated with sort of getting these things closed out from a tax and treasury and REITs standpoint and various other factors and always seems to be more than we think. But I would say that, I think we're making really good progress Jim and Eric and the whole xScale team along with a lot of an army of people on our tax and treasury teams and various other elements within the organization are working hard on getting those things going. I think you're going to see good momentum during the course of 2020 for us on the xScale side.","Keith Taylor","And then, just as it relates to the impact on the quarter on an xScale, the largest impact that you really saw was the amount of cash that came into the business. As you recall from the Q3 earnings call, we had $355 million of cash come onto our balance sheet and there is roughly \u20ac60 million of what we refer to as milestone payments. They would come over the next sort of 12 to 24 months in the business.","As it relates to the operating performance, we're just really getting started, and this is going to be I think an appropriate and really good discussion at the June Analyst Day, just giving everybody an update on how we are performing. But it's - it's as good, if not better than we anticipated and the momentum that Jim and his team see in a marketplace is substantial.","So from our perspective, there is no surprises and nothing meaningful running through the fourth quarter results.","Operator","Our next question will come from Phil Cusick with JPMC. Your line is now open.","Phil Cusick","Can you dig into what gives you the confidence in the 2021 expansion and development after what looks like a robust 2020 plan as well? Thanks.","Charles Meyers","Yes, I mean I think it's just, if you look at multi-year view on the business, we probably - I think right now, we have a better multi sort of longer term view of the customer opportunity in the funnel than we've ever had.","And so, I think that if you look at fill rates and the trajectory on our fill rates, if you look at sort of any I think underlying industry drivers in terms of the pace of adoption of cloud, you look at what's happening in terms of overall data volumes, you look at the impact and influence, sort of things like AI and an IoT, I mean, I think you start to see the front edge potentially of 5G increasing sort of both traffic and overall, sort of data volumes.","And so, I continue to think that the secular forces driving the overall demand for infrastructure are strong. We're hearing that from our customers and we're hearing them be very responsive to our sort of long-term vision for the platform and that includes the expansion of capabilities and services as well as our plans for geographic expansion over time.","So, the combination of all of those things continue. Obviously '21 is a bit far out, but we feel very good about the projects that we have underway right now and the fill rates that we're going to - that are supporting those investment decisions and I'm super optimistic that '21 will be just as exciting.","Keith Taylor","And Phil, if I can just add to what Charles said. The beauty of our plan too is we've got 32 projects underway across 23 different markets. So it's the diversity of our investment and they're coming in different shapes and sizes based on the demand profile of a given market. So we feel we have that visibility. It is a little bit far out as Charles referred to.","But given the strength of our pipeline, the momentum that we saw in 2019 coming into 2020 and the depth of our pipeline and the opportunity set, that's what gives us the confidence to continue to build, particularly in some of the markets where we're one of the few that is building.","Operator","Our next question will come from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Erik Rasmussen","So, as it relates to your 2020 guidance, is sort of like a two part question. But have you turned the corner with the Verizon assets and is this the year you're starting to see growth? And then within that, it sounds like you're a little bit more confident in the Americas, 5% or greater. What's driving this sort of positive dynamic and then what sort of the long-term growth rate that you would see or sustain rate on that business or region?","Charles Meyers","Yes. I do think we have that one of the factors, certainly Verizon has been one of the factors that has been delaying, I think the grow or sort of a bit of a growth headwind to the region. Now, that's been a net economic benefit to the company. So we're not complaining about it. But it has been a bit of a churn because that - there's a bit of a headwind as that churn continues to drive through.","But again, we feel - we feel like we're going to be able to see a return to growth as Keith indicated in the script. I think that we feel like as we move towards the end of the year, we're going to be looking at a greater than 5%. And I think the strength of the go-to-market engine in the Americas selling across the world continues to be substantial.","And so, so I think that, I do think the Americas business, we feel a level of optimism there that we're going to sort of get through some of the remainder of the churn tail on Verizon and really see that business pick up a bit in growth.","Keith Taylor","And Erik, we've always said this certainly in the investor conferences, that Charles and I and others go to. We always can grow the business faster if we want, but it's - it's what we do as the pricing discipline. And Charles referred to going after the right customer, right application, the right IBX and being disciplined and going after those interconnection rich opportunities that really cause us to feel very comfortable on what our guide is, and recognizing - yes, we can certainly can go do a lot of very substantial hyperscale deals in the Americas.","But we think that would be value destructive for our business. And so, we focus that opportunity in our hyperscale initiative with our JV partner in other parts of the world where we can get an appropriate churn alongside our partners.","But I think it's the discipline that we bring to the Americas region, it gives us the confidence that we don't have to go stretch ourselves here. We're - it's a very good and very successful business and we want to keep on doing what we're doing.","Charles Meyers","Yes. One last comment I'd make Erik is that we noted in the script, the continued globalization of the selling engine is a really important thing, is something Karl and Mike and team have really focused on in terms of making sure that we're as I always used to say, we're making sure that every rep selling, every data center every day, right, and that they're out there positioning the full global platform.","We saw EMEA have a - for the first time sell more out outbound than they got inbound. And that's a really positive step for us. It really shows the strength. And those are the things that when you have the global platform and companies, large companies perhaps, they're headquartered elsewhere sort of - would that - that are driving demand into all our regions, including the Americas. I think that's going to be a contributor to growth.","Erik Rasmussen","Maybe just as my follow up. This is more of a maybe a bigger picture, a theme. But are you seeing any shifts in the underlying trends in the industry that are giving you increased confidence, and sort of how you are positioned and your ability to achieve your current long-term growth objectives?","Charles Meyers","Yes. I mentioned a number of them, I think. I think the - I guess, I would put a sort of an overall umbrella frame or overall frame around it in the context of digital transformation. Digital transformation is an absolute priority at a board and senior executive team level in virtually every company that we are talking to and targeting. And so it matters a lot to them. They're thinking hard about how to drive digital transformation in their business and how to deploy infrastructure to support that.","And so I think, one, that focus on digital transformation aim - and that's happening because of these various trends. People, for example, seeing AI is central to their ability to create competitive advantage and they're using - they're viewing data as central to their ability to create competitive advantage. And they're just - they're investing behind a lot of these trends and they're needing to deploy infrastructure globally to have their infrastructure work and their applications to operate as they're designed.","And so I think though - that's sort of the secular backdrop, and then you bounce against that sort of the Equinix position, which was, we have this unique position I think in terms of being able to really promote and accelerate the hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice.","There are many customers are, in fact, using us as an avenue to access the cloud, to move workloads between cloud resources and then to place their private infrastructure, even if that private infrastructure maybe getting smaller than it used to once be when it was living inside their enterprise data centers, they're taking what remains as private infrastructure and they want to place it in direct proximity to the cloud, and that's really what I think Equinix does better than anybody else in the world.","And so I think those are - there is a variety of both secular trends as well as sort of our own market position that combined to give you a sense of optimism for the road ahead, which is exactly why we're continue to invest behind the platform, invest behind the go-to-market engine and excited about what lies ahead.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Ari Klein","It looks like EBITDA margins are coming in a bit in 2020. Keith, can you maybe parse through the impacts in a bit more detail. How much from higher utility expense is taxes? And then the meaningful investments in the go-to-market strategy that we're alluded to, can you talk to where those investments are being made?","Charles Meyers","Maybe, Ari, this is Charles. Maybe I'll jump in and just give you the broader context for I think our decision in terms of how we're guiding in the margin, then Keith can add any color there. But if you look at 2020, it's pretty similar to what happened in '19. In both years we showed significant operating leverage, but we saw some specific items that impacted our ability to drop that through to the bottom line.","In '19, it was projections on utility costs combined with some pretty significant expansion drag that last year that led us to guide to a roughly flat margin line. As you know, we ended up delivering expansion in 2019, finishing at about 48.5%, because utility trend was frankly a bit better than we projected. But we are seeing those utility increases materialize, not just in EMEA, but in some of our other markets as well.","And those combined with the property tax increases compared to '19, those things together consume most of the operating leverage. So we are kind of left in the position of either offering out some modest margin growth and not investing in the business or funding the key investments and guiding to a flatter margin and we did that - and that's obviously we chose in the latter.","We feel like it's our job to maximize long-term value creation and we're confident that bringing up the dollars to invest in the platform evolution, growing the go-to-market engine, driving our own digital transformation are all things that are going to help us sustain AFFO per share growth, and frankly, that's our lighthouse metric and we feel like it would be irresponsible not to invest behind the momentum that we have right now.","Ari Klein","Got it.","Charles Meyers","Keith, any color you want to add?","Keith Taylor","No, I mean - I think you hit it square on - square on the head, so.","Ari Klein","Maybe shifting gears a bit. Does the Packet acquisition reflect the shift in M&A strategy in any way? Should we expect future acquisitions to be more focused on the services front versus maybe new markets given how many you're already in?","Charles Meyers","No, I wouldn't call a shift, I'd call it an augment. It's a - look, we're going to continue to view geographic expansion of the platform as a strategic priority for us and where that can be done in a value creating way via M&A, then we certainly will - will think about doing that. So we've talked about the fact that we still have additional - additions to our platform from geography - geographic coverage standpoint that we'd like to make, and I think M&A will be a vehicle for us in that regard.","Having said that, I also, I do think that's an augment you saw Packet as really the first of a really a capabilities type of acquisition. We're super excited about what they bring to the table. What that is going to allow for us in terms of bringing an enterprise-grade bare metal offering to the table that is really going to be responsive to customer needs and will help animate our core value proposition in really compelling ways, in ways that our customers are asking for.","And as for to whether or not we might see other things that look like that, that are more capabilities oriented, I would certainly say that's a possibility for us. We're going to continue to build by our partner as we need to execute it on the strategy and to make sure that we can capture the opportunity in front of us.","Keith Taylor","Ari, one of the things I'd just add on maybe just making one other comment just about the EBITDA margins, because one of the things as we do recognize that there are these higher costs that are going through the financials. But if you look at it on a quarterly basis, Q1 theoretically will be our lowest guide and then as each quarter goes by through the year, you would see an improving EBITDA margin.","And so it gives you a sense that with the operating leverage in the business that we're realizing plus recognizing these costs, but the momentum that we foresee will cause our margins to continue to go up. So when we enter 2021, obviously we're in a - we'd be in a better position than we are coming out of Q1.","Operator","Our next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Colby Synesael","Maybe just a few housekeeping items just to start off. First off, on the greater than 5% Americas growth that should be thought it was like a fourth quarter 2020 growth number, right, not a full 2020 over 2019 number, correct?","Charles Meyers","Yes. We see it growing throughout the year as we're trying to say. So I think it's more second half than the first half.","Colby Synesael","And then the next question, you mentioned I think 3% to 4% stabilized growth.","Charles Meyers","Yes.","Colby Synesael","Is that recurring stabilized growth or is that total stabilized growth?","Charles Meyers","Recurring.","Colby Synesael","Okay. Recurring. And then you had previously guided to greater than 50% EBITDA margins by 2022 at your 2018 Analyst Day. Is that still your expectation?","Charles Meyers","Well, since that time, Colby, and we had sort of you had put more perhaps uncertainty around the exact timing, I think our posture over the past year and a half or so has really been that we believe the 50% it's achievable, but that we're not willing to trade off sort of long-term value creation for achievement of a near-term margin objective.","And so I think that we still believe it is achievable. I think our primary focus as a team is going to continue to be a long-term value creation, and by the way, that does not mean we have in any way shape or form lost focus on driving operating leverage. It's a key priority for us to allow us to invest in the business and still deliver the financial results we need, but right now I wouldn't want to put a particular timeline on the 50%.","Colby Synesael","And then just my last one, cabinet adds. So cabinet adds in 2019 were lower in aggregate across all regions total versus 2018. And in this most recent quarter, you added a decent amount of cabs to your inventory and we really didn't see any meaningful acceleration in installed and your utilization rate actually came down again. And I think now is slightly below 80%. What's your expectation for cabinet adds? You mentioned 32 expansions that are ongoing. How should we think about that number maybe on a year-over-year basis in '20 versus '19? And how big of a focus is that metric for you guys when you look at the performance of the business. Thank you.","Charles Meyers","Yes, I mean, I think there's a couple of things. One, there is always some level of volatility in it, I mean, that's why we've always encouraged people to look at the rolling four quarter. Having said that, even when you look at our rolling four quarter. I think you're seeing some downward pressure, and I think that is primarily a factor of couple of things. One, it's really a factor of execution. It's a reflection of execution of the strategy, frankly.","And by going to the xScale product, that is going to take some really lumpy things out of the mix. If you look at the non-financial metrics sheet and you look at Asia, which was I think Q1 of last year, it was like if memory serves 5,700 cabs or something crazy. And a lot of that was stuff that we would be pushing off into xScale.","And so I think that - I think the mix of business is going to shift probably to put a little downward pressure on cabinet adds. I think by the way we have sized our capacity investments and all of our new builds to reflect that strategy.","So we didn't overbuild and then go - while we didn't - and now we got too much. That was always our plan and so, so I think you're going to see a little bit of a movement in utilization as new capacity comes online, but I think the - if you take the last few quarters, you're probably - and average them, you're probably seeing a reasonable reflection of what we're going to do from a cabinet adds perspective.","And again you'll always see a little bit, of lumpiness in that, but I do think there is a little bit of downward pressure, but I think that should not be viewed as a negative. It should be viewed as a really a reflection of the strength of the core strategy and how we're delivering against it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is now open.","Michael Rollins","First, can you give us an update on where your customers are from a grooming perspective for interconnection? And how that could play over the course of the year? And then just taking a step back. Are you seeing any change in demand for the markets and data centers kind of below the original primary interconnection points that have been part of the heritage Equinix story for a long time? And just curious given the trends that you talked about, if there is just an expansion of interest and where customers want to locate their infrastructure. Thanks.","Charles Meyers","Mike, what was the first part, again? I'm sorry. I was thinking about the second one.","Michael Rollins","Update on the grooming\u2026","Charles Meyers","Phase grooming. Yes, okay got it.","Michael Rollins","The interconnection grooming. Thanks.","Charles Meyers","Yes. By the way it sounds like cold got you, so I hope you feeling better.","Michael Rollins","Thanks you.","Charles Meyers","The grooming, I would say that we're, again, particularly as it relates - the biggest interconnection grooming tends to come either in the form of 10 to 100 migration for really large interconnection consumers.","And as I've said, I think that the really big ones have already come through the process and particularly in the U.S. and when I say the U.S., they are really U.S. based companies, but they have really sort of largely embarked on their global grooming already.","So I think we're - I'd use the words that we were going to probably see it tapering through 2020. I think that's still the case. We saw fourth quarter was - we did not see what we thought we might see, which was something that happened in fourth quarter of last year of '18, which was - we felt like the network moratoriums really kept people from - we saw really a Q3 and Q4 that was roughly, kind of linear or roughly flat.","But bottom line, I think that we'll see some tapering of that, I think that - a lot of our customers are very advanced and then the other major form of grooming you see is when carrier consolidation occurs. And we see, we've seen some of that over time, but I wouldn't say that we're seeing any sort of acute levels of that.","So I think that on balance over the course of 2020 that's something that we'll see improve. And I think we're going to see - we've kind of guided to the 7,000 to 9,000 on interconnections, that typically is made up of sort of 5,000 to 7,000 on physical cross connects and then call it in the couple of thousand range on virtual. I think we're going to see virtual continue to climb, although there is a bit of a mix there in terms of how people - what speeds they're buying at and those kind of things.","But overall, I think it will taper off and we'll see a really - I think we'll see a strong interconnection year. I mean this last quarter was a really strong interconnection quarter, we're really, really pleased with the performance of the business.","And then, your second question as to sort of the mix of demand from sort of first tier interconnection rich campuses and locations versus others. I do think that there is - one of the things that has really helped us, Mike, is that we extended the ECX Fabric and interconnected all of our facilities. And so now people still have the ability to on-ramp to the broader ecosystem from any of our facilities and there are people - our teams have really been able to work that into the selling.","And so let's face it, the - it's the Ashburns and Silicon Valleys and Frankfurts and Londons and Amsterdams that continue to drive big investment and really big growth, but some of these - some of the second markets or even the second - more of the second tier facilities within primary markets, I think that the Fabric has been a help for us in terms of making sure that we're monetizing those effectively.","Operator","Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Frank Louthan","Following up on the Packet questions. Are there any other products that you think that you need to have in your arsenal there to service the customers? And in the past, you sort of skewed things that might compete with your customers, are you rethinking that to a certain extent, maybe with network for other things. Thanks.","Charles Meyers","Yes, well, we had talked in and as we've sort of laid out our platform - our evolving platform strategy in the past, we've talked about this edge services layer, and we talked about Network Edge, Compute Edge, Edge Data, Edge Security, etc. We think there is opportunities for us in all of those and it will be a mix of things that we will deliver ourselves, which we did with Network Edge and which we did - which we now are facilitating via the Packet acquisition with some level of Edge Compute.","But we also think there will be perhaps even more of those that are Edge based services that represent combinations of our value with third party value and partner value. And so, which gets me to sort of the second part of your question, which is - are we kind of our - we have - we typically have had a position, where we are a bit of a neutral player. And I think that serves us well and we've always been about choice and optionality and making sure customers can select from the providers that they want.","And I don't think that from a philosophy standpoint changes a bit for us. And so we're going to continue to embrace that, we're going to continue to invite partners in to deliver value. In some cases if customers are pressing us to deliver services that they want to see from us, then we're going to seriously consider that.","If we think those are areas where we have the capability to play, the permission to play and that they'll deliver - very kinds of returns. And so it's going to be an evolution of our strategy, but I think that we're going to continue to be about building ecosystems, where people can bring value, combining with what we do and solve customer problems.","So I'd encourage you to come to Analyst Day, which I'm sure we'll see you there in June and I think we'll probably have a little bit more meat on that bone that we can share with you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Simon Flannery","Keith just on the leverage, you've obviously done a nice job bringing that down. How are you thinking, I know the 3 to 4 range, but given where interest rates are, is it more optimal to stay in the upper half of that range. And are you seeing any opportunities to build in - buy in more of your real estate? And then for Charles on the bill timing, the point on funnel visibility was very helpful. But there is a lot of stuff 18 plus even 24 months out. What's the thought process around that? Is any of that driven by - in your construction or other complications, or is it really just phasing the buildings out there? And I'm thinking of some of the stuff like the Amsterdam moratorium and stuff. Are you seeing any other municipalities looking at some of those issues? Thanks.","Keith Taylor","Sure. Hey, Simon, so let me take the first part and then we'll push it to Charles, for the second part. First on leverage, right now we're 3.7 times levered. But clearly that's well within our guided range and historically we said 3 to 4. But after we got our credit rating upgrade, we always felt that we probably play at the higher end of that range, but truthfully when you just look at the operating leverage in the business, as you look forward over a number of years, all else being equal, you're going to be in a deleveraging scenario or said differently, it's going to give you the flexibility to choose how you deploy that capital and keep leverage at an appropriate level.","So we feel very, very confident that we're appropriately levered, we think to adjust the growth of the business that we will - we would otherwise delever again, all else being equal. And we know that we can then borrow money, we can borrow money today and all likelihood tomorrow at a much lower cost than we are incurring today, and that's what gives us - again, we're trying to be very clear with our AFFO per share that the interest burden that we're bearing today, relative to what we'll bear tomorrow, is more substantial.","And you just can do the math on the $3 billion worth of euro debt or the $2 billion of high-yield debt is yet to be refinanced, there's substantial savings that can be realized from just refinancing those today at current rates versus where the rates may eventually go is substantial to the AFFO per share.","As it relates to buying some of our real estate, we're always looking at it, but - it's a buy versus lease decision and it's really about economic control of the asset, but absolutely to the extent there is something out there that makes sense, we'll be active.","Particularly, when we look at the lease costs of our - the lease cost that we're bearing in the contract with our landlord. And so that's just, let me just assure you that's something that we'll continue to look at, we have a very strong real estate organization inside our company and we remain active at looking at our properties.","Simon Flannery","Thanks.","Charles Meyers","And then on the build-out. Yes, I get the gist to that question, obviously, some of those are a little bit more protracted in terms of their delivery time frames. Some of that is just markets where for a variety of reasons, it's more difficult to get things done from a permitting perspective, from a power perspective, it's oftentimes power that is the - and the availability of power that dictate the timeline on these things, but generally, we are building phased projects, so we have a level of confidence in terms of not putting too much capacity into the market in the get-go, unless those are xScale that are fully pre-sold in which case, obviously, if those are pre-sold, we want to get them built out as quickly as possible.","I would say that from a construction standpoint, it's a robust market. And so there are, I do think part of it is just macro forces, which is the demand for labor for example in these markets is high. And so that is an area where I actually think we end up being differentiated, because we kind of often can get to the front of the line, because we have a history of having done 4 or 5 or 8 or 10 projects with somebody. And when we say, we need your best teams, we often get them.","And so - but there are some protracted timelines, and it's something that I think Ralph and our construction teams globally are continuing to work on. There are also some times where there is specific circumstances. Whether they'll be for example Olympics, that is often something that sort of changes the circumstances of a particular build, but I wouldn't say right now it's anything in terms of extending project timelines due to supply chain challenges or anything like that, but there are some that are further definitely further out there in time.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Jon Petersen","In the press release you - talking about cross connect adds, you guys called out new streaming services as a big demand driver. I'm kind of curious with your experience with some of the streaming services that have been around for a few years, that I'm sure you have those customers kind of what the ramp is in terms of how they add cross connects, is it - are you guys kind of expecting as one big wave when they launch the product or is it kind of a steady stream of demand going forward?","Charles Meyers","Well, you are right, we do have experience in this area, but I would say the dynamics of those and also potentially the market power of the players involved are different. And I think if you look at public information in terms of what some of these services have done, they have been exceptionally successful in terms of subscriber acquisition. So I'm not sure, I would apply any prior experience necessarily to these things, but they're very thoughtful organizations.","We work very closely with them in terms of capacity planning and we're excited about what they - what we think those could imply in terms of continued sort of tailwinds really for the interconnection business.","Jon Petersen","And then maybe to kind of come back to the leverage in equity needs. Potentially it looks like the 2020 guidance assumes no equity issuance. I think, last year you initially gave guidance that didn't assume equity issuance and then you did. And so I'm kind of curious what your resources of capital needs are for equity throughout the year? Should we expect you guys to dribble out through the ATM or any other - anything else?","Charles Meyers","Again in 2019, we really, we sort of front run the process as far as raising equity sooner in the year than we originally anticipated. And then as you know in the back end of the year, we raised a little bit more debt than we needed to, want to refinance the debt that we are taking out, but to put some cash on the balance sheet, which was really a precursor to funding for 2020.","And so we're in a - obviously a very good position from a cash and liquidity perspective and we're going to take this posture is always about creating long-term shareholder value and - but what we also believe it is a combination of debt and equity that's got us to where we need to be.","Obviously at - pardon me, debt is the cheapest form of capital today and we're going to continue to look at the markets on that basis. There is nothing, nothing imminent. And as you also know we have an ATM program that still has capacity on it $300 million, of the current ATM programs still has our availability. And so if we were to draw on capital for any purpose, it'll be a combination of both and we're going to be very strategic about those decisions as we have in the past.","Operator","Our last question will come from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Nick Del Deo","And question on Packet to start. I think people generally understand where the sustainable competitive advantage for core Equinix comes from. How would you describe the source and durability of the competitive advantage for Packet?","Charles Meyers","The great answer to it I think, is that it's actually the Equinix value proposition. If you look at it, Packet is really a reflection of shifts in how people want to consume our value proposition. Our core value proposition is - continues to be what it has been, superior global reach, advantage to access the scale, digital ecosystems to drive cost and performance, the most comprehensive interconnection portfolio and the business and an unparalleled track record of service excellence.","And we have for 20 years, been animating that value proposition with Colo but what Packet allows is for us to essentially, animate that same - those same value propositions via a different consumption vehicle for our customers.","And so the durable advantage still relies - still resides very much in what core platform Equinix delivers and the bare metal service obviously, we're going to need to deliver a - from a usability perspective and from a API integration perspective and the efforts and capabilities that Packet has to for automation and integration with the software ecosystem with the likes of VMware, et cetera, those are all things we're going to leverage to make sure that that's a really competitive bare metal offer, but it's the powerful part about this is its unlocking and extending and increasing the addressable market for the core Equinix value proposition.","Katrina Rymill","Great.

Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. It's good to be joining all of you as we share our strong results for the first half of 2018. This was a quarter of many new highs with continued momentum in our key metrics as our go to market engine and interconnection strategy continue to drive results.","We delivered record bookings in all three regions driven by robust growth across our verticals with particular momentum in our cross regional activity. We now serve 48% of the Fortune 500 and 33% of Global 2000 companies, both up 1% quarter-over-quarter and we're demonstrating a highly attractive land and expand dynamics with these lighthouse customers.","Channel sales stepped up to over 20% of bookings and accounted for half of our new logos in the quarter driven by solid performance across the regions and across our partner types, and the power of the global platform continues with over 50% of our revenue coming from customers deployed across all three regions and 85% from customers deployed across multiple metros, both metrics up 1% quarter-over-quarter.","Turning to the results of the quarter, and as depicted on slide 3, second quarter revenues were $1.262 billion as reported, up 9% over the same quarter last year and above the top-end of our guidance range on an FX neutral basis. Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO were both up over 6% over the same quarter last year which includes our planned investments in Verizon to support long-term growth. These growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis.","Interconnection revenues continued to outpace colocation, growing 13% year-over-year and now include Verizon. Our metrics across interconnection counts, billable cabinets and MRR per cabinet all demonstrate continued execution of the strategy and reflect the strong health of the business.","Our global platform continues to scale and we're extending our leadership within each region through a combination of targeted M&A and strong organic growth. I'll provide highlights on three of our latest acquisitions, Infomart, Metronode and Verizon, each of which significantly enhances our strategic position and all of which are progressing well from an integration perspective.","Starting with Infomart, Dallas; this strategic purchase allowed us to gain full control of a critical set of assets in our IBX portfolio and cement our market leadership position with this important interconnection hub. The Infomart deal is creating new opportunities to grow our business in Dallas which is one of the largest colocation markets in the Americas. We're starting plans to build out incremental capacity in line with our acquisition plan in support of both retail and hyperscale demand, and we're moving forward with the final phase of our Dallas 6 build. We continue to refine our long-term master plan for the Infomart location and see a stable run rate from over 50 other tenants in this sizable building.","Moving to our Metronode transaction, this acquisition significantly enhanced our national reach in Australia and bolted us into the market leadership position in one of the most innovative IT markets in the world where hybrid and multi-cloud has rapidly emerged as a clear architecture of choice. This acquisition is tracking well against our expectations with growing pipeline of multi-national opportunities. We also recently announced our Perth expansion where IBX will house the landing station for the upcoming Vocus subsea cable between Australia and Singapore.","And finally our Verizon integration efforts are progressing well. Our pipeline and bookings into these assets remain strong, but we are constrained giving the very high utilization rates in key facilities. Consistent with our prior comments, we continue to expect flat quarterly revenue from Verizon over the year, but we're adding an incremental capacity in the back half which positions us well for 2019. Also we continue to work through the churn previously discussed and we have a healthy pipeline for our planned expansions and as we progress through next year we expect the Verizon portfolio to grow in line with our other stabilized assets.","We also completed the integration of Terremark Federal Group into our Government Solutions business expanding our federal industry expertise and adding key capabilities for federal agencies and system integrators. This integration added 33 personnel to the Equinix team bringing a deep understanding of the federal sector and enabling us to act as trusted advisers for IT transformation initiatives in this key sector. Our diverse portfolio of assets including former Verizon government campuses in Miami and Culpeper allows us to direct workloads to the optimal environment based on security, cost and performance. We view government as a sizable expansion of our addressable market and are increasing our engagement from a business development customer and sales perspective to execute on a significant opportunity.","Now let me make a few comments on organic development activity. We continue to invest capital, adding capacity in response to strong underlying demand. In the second quarter, we completed builds in our Amsterdam, Denver, and London data centers. Our platform is 82% utilized, and we have a very active pipeline with 32 expansion projects currently underway.","This quarter, we also announced our entry into Oman. We have partnered with Omantel, a global communications company. And in 2019 we'll open the first carrier neutral data center in Oman's capital, Muscat, which will create a regional interconnection hub with low latencies between key global business markets.","On the hyperscale front, we continue to progress in building out our hyperscale infrastructure team, designing and building initial capacity and working on our financing structures, which we expect to have in place by early next year. Our initial approach is to leverage capacity in select hybrid facilities such as London 9 and 10 to capture early wins and maintain momentum in the overall cloud ecosystem. In parallel, our first dedicated facility, Paris 8, is scheduled for delivery in Q1. And we're using our deep existing relationships with the targeted hyperscalers to cultivate a meaningful demand pipeline.","Shifting to interconnection. Interconnection is foundational to our strategy and continues to grow significantly faster than the rest of our business with each new connection translating into additional customer value and a deeper, more durable relationship with Equinix.","We now have over 288,000 cross-connects with healthy net adds despite selective churn headwinds associated with migration to 100-gig. Cross-connect adds remain strong and virtual connections are growing rapidly as digital transformations fuel ECX Fabric growth. ECX Fabric now has over 1,200 customers. And we expanded availability to Australia and Japan this quarter with the remainder of APAC targeted for Q3 and full inter-regional connectivity by year-end.","Adoption of ECX Fabric inter-metro functionality is ahead of expectations as customers connect to counterparties in different metro locations, and between their own deployments across Platform Equinix.","Our Internet Exchange platform also continues to grow in both ports and traffic volumes. And we have been expanding our IX presence to make our entire interconnection portfolio available across our global footprint. This quarter, we launched new internet exchanges in Denver, Houston, Lisbon and Madrid and now operate in 32 markets globally.","Now I'll cover some highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical delivered strong bookings led by APAC, growth in the wireless sub-segment and strong sell-through business with our top NSP partners as we and as end customers expand capabilities for digital business. New wins and expansions included Pivotel Satellite, a leading Australian mobile satellite solution provider extending network coverage, and China Mobile, also extending its network to support a growing user base.","Our fastest growing vertical, enterprise, experienced record bookings led by manufacturing, health care and government sub-segments. New wins included Lithia Motors, a Fortune 500 auto retailer optimizing their network topology and localizing traffic to improve performance and reduce costs; a Fortune 100 retail warehouse club connecting to multiple clouds; and a global beverage distributor implementing cloud connectivity.","Our financial services vertical achieved record bookings led by insurance and banking, reflecting solid execution of our strategy to tap new ecosystem opportunities beyond electronic trading. New wins included a top 20 global asset manager re-architecting its network and leveraging our dense ecosystems and a public government sponsored enterprise in the mortgage market, transforming network topology to improve performance.","Our cloud and IT vertical produced strong new logo growth and solid bookings, as service providers embrace Equinix as a key partner in delivering the reach, performance and scalability they need in their global infrastructure.","We see the cloud first IT service marketplace diversifying. And we enjoyed new wins with ForeScout Technologies, Links Technologies (12:35), CorpCloud and Secure Agility.","Our content and digital media vertical experienced strong bookings led by gaming and publishing sub-segments. The expansions included Tencent, deploying edge nodes to support their coverage and scale, as well as a global commerce leader deploying their own CDN infrastructure in Australia to improve performance and end user experience.","But now, let me turn the call over to Keith, to cover the results for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Thanks, PVC, and good afternoon to everyone. We had a great second quarter of delivering strong results across each of our core operating metrics. Consistent with our expectations and implied in our financial guidance both our gross and net bookings were all-time records and our booking pipeline continues to be robust.","Our AFFO per share metric trended above our expectations despite the recent M&A and financing activities, both which put the company in a better strategic and financial position. And as you know, no currencies fluctuated meaningfully throughout the quarter, while our hedges worked effectively to offset a significant portion of the volatility to our reported results.","Given our booking strength, our stable churn, we anticipate substantial quarter-over-quarter recurring revenue step-ups in the second half of the year and therefore anticipate a strong exit into 2019.","Turning to the acquisitions in April, we closed both the Metronode and Infomart Dallas transactions. We're already off to a good start and are working on expansion initiatives related to both these acquisitions consistent with our internal plans. Our guidance now assumes an annualized revenue run rate of approximately $60 million from Metronode and $35 million from the current Infomart tenant base.","Revenues from the Verizon assets having closed the transaction over a year ago and now part of our reporter results and have delivered against our internal plans, while creating substantial value for our platform as well as being a highly accretive deal to our equity holders. We're seeing strong gross bookings related to the Verizon assets and the poured (14:43) pipeline remains active, while we expect the MRR churn to abate by the end of the year.","We continue to plan for flat quarter-over-quarter revenue growth from these assets over the remainder of the year. As expected we continue to invest in the IBXs to bring their operations to Equinix standards including scaling the operations team, increasing our investment in business support and incurring higher repairs and maintenance expenses to support higher operating protocols. As we exit 2018 with the Verizon asset integration largely behind us, we expect the revenues to grow as we invest in the core Verizon markets including the soon to be opened NAP of the Americas expansion in Miami.","For integration cost, our guidance is essentially flat at $49 million for 2018. So now turning to the second quarter. As depicted on slide 4, Q2 was another strong quarter of operating performance and our 62nd quarter of sequential top line revenue growth. Global Q2 revenues were $1.262 billion, up 9% over the same quarter last year. Sorry, yeah sorry, over the same quarter last year, and above the top end of our guidance range on an FX neutral basis.","APAC and EMEA were the fastest growing regions at 14% and 12% respectively on a year-over-year basis followed by the Americas at 6%. The Verizon assets contributed $133 million of revenues, essentially flat quarter-over-quarter as anticipated. Q2 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $9 million negative currency impact when compared to the Q1 average FX rates and a $10 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $604 million, up 6% over the same quarter last year and better than expectations due to lower integration costs and timing of our operating spend. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.7% excluding the integration costs. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges had a $1 million negative impact when compared to the Q1 average FX rates and a $3 million negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates.","Global Q2 AFFO was $428 million, up 6% over the same quarter last year largely due to strong operating performance and lower than planned recurring capital expenditures. AFFO per share was $5.37, a 17% uplift over the same quarter last year. Q2 global MR churn was 2.4%. For the year, we continue to expect 2018 MRR quarterly churn to average between 2% and 2.5%.","Billable cabinet additions were very strong this quarter in part due to hyperscaler activity in our London-based hybrid assets, increasing by 5,900 a record for the business. Our MRR per cabinet metric remained firm although down slightly on an FX neutral basis due to the level of billable cabinet additions, strong sales activity into the smaller and lower priced assets effectively our mix, and the timing of large footprint deals.","Turning to regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. The Americas region had a great quarter across the board delivering solid revenue and adjusted EBITDA results. Record bookings in the region were led by the cloud and financial services verticals. EMEA also saw record bookings in the quarter, led by the strength in our German and Dutch markets, where we saw a sizable pickup in billable cabinets as large hyperscalers deployed across a number of our core markets, including more significant deployments in our London and Frankfurt campuses. And Asia Pacific continue to drive strong bookings, including strength in our Singapore and Japan markets, as well as increased outbound bookings to the two other regions largely due to ongoing success with the Chinese and Korean multinationals, leveraging our global platform.","Interconnection activities saw continued momentum, adding over 5,000 cross-connects and provisioning significant port capacity in the second quarter.","In the quarter, interconnection revenues absorbed FX headwinds and some one-time adjustments related to the install base review from our acquisitions, compressing our normal quarterly dollar step up. The Americas and Asia Pacific interconnection revenues were 22% and 13% respectively, while EMEA was 9% of recurring revenues. From a total company perspective, interconnection revenues were 17% of total recurring revenues.","And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to slide 8. Our balance sheet continues to position us for success as we grow and scale the business globally. Our balance sheet eclipsed the $20 billion mark for the first time this quarter. Our unrestricted cash balance is approximately $1 billion. In July, we refinanced out of our yen denominated debt in the Japan market increasing our financial flexibility as well as extending and improving terms. Our net debt leverage ratio increased to 4.3 times our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA with the close of the two recent acquisitions, slightly better than the pro forma target discussed at the Analyst Day on June 20. Also in the quarter we saw strong improvement in our working capital position as reflected in our operating cash flows.","Turning to slide 9, for the quarter capital expenditures were $520 million including a recurring CapEx of $42 million. Consistent with our comments at Analyst Day, we're investing across many of our markets to support the scale of the business. We currently have 32 construction projects underway, two-thirds of which are on own property adding capacity in 23 markets around the world. The majority of our investment is going into highly utilized margin rich metros that each generate over $100 million of revenues.","Revenues from owned assets stepped up to 47% with the close of the Infomart and Metronode acquisitions. We also purchased land parcels for future expansions in Dublin, Munich, and Sydney.","Our capital investments are delivering healthy growth and strong returns as shown on slide 10. This quarter we added the Verizon assets to our same-store analysis. We now have 128 stabilized assets that grew revenues 4% year-over-year on a same-store basis, largely driven by increasing colocation and interconnection revenues including increased power density. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 30% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally please refer to slides 11 through 16 for our summary of 2018 guidance and bridges.","For the full year 2018 excluding the impact of FX we are increasing our revenue guidance by $10 million, and our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $5 million, largely due to favorability from our recent acquisitions. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar net of our FX hedges decreased full-year revenues guidance by $55 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $21 million. Absent the FX hedges, revenues would have decreased by $97 million. This guidance implies a 9% year-over-year revenue growth rate and a healthy EBITDA margin of 48% excluding integration costs. And the momentum of our business is continuing to drive both AFFO and AFFO per share growth enabling us to offset the impact attributed to negative FX movements, the recent acquisitions and the higher debt service costs related to our incremental financings.","We are maintaining our 2018 as reported AFFO per share guidance of $20.19 per share at midpoint or excluding integration costs $20.82 per share. Over the remainder of the year, we expect quarterly fluctuations in the core components of AFFO generally due to the level of recurring capital spending patterns and discrete tax events related to our acquisitions.","We've assumed a weighted average 80 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. AFFO is expected to grow 12% year-over-year on an as reported basis. We expect our 2018 non-recurring capital expenditures to range between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. And finally, with respect to our cash dividends, for the third quarter the dividend will be $2.28 per share. For 2018, we expect to payout total cash dividends of $725 million, reflecting an AFFO payout ratio of approximately 45%.","So with that, I'll turn the call back to PVC.","Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Thanks, Keith. So in closing, we delivered a great quarter as the go to market engine drove record bookings and a strong pace of cabinet adds. Our global platform and ecosystems remain at the heart of the strategy as evidenced by strong cross-regional sales and healthy interconnection growth this quarter. We are looking forward to the second half as we focus on our strategic initiatives, deliver value from our acquisitions and work to convert a healthy pipeline for the remainder of the year.","So let me stop here, and Mary, let's open it up for questions. Mary, are you there?","Operator","Yes, sir. Are you ready to take questions?","Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Yes. We're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","I'm so sorry for that, sir. Okay. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We have our first question from Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Frank, your line is now open. You may begin.","Alex Sklar - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","[Technical Difficulty] (25:11-25:18) stay on the HIT team and what you \u2013 anything you've booked to-date there, and then also on the APAC outbound sales that you said increase the other two regions. Can you just give a little bit more color on the types of customers that you are getting in multiple regions, I know, you mentioned China Mobile, anything else on the hyperscale side? Thank you.","Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Frank, we missed the very first part of your question.","Alex Sklar - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I was saying, it's Alex on, and then also that \u2013 I was \u2013 question about the HIT team. I know you gave a little bit of an update at the analyst day but any color on bookings to date for that group?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Sure. So, this is Charles. Alex, we did close some key wins that we would \u2013 that are \u2013 were with the hyperscaleers and that we would consider HIT type opportunities. We did close those however in more hybrid facilities, particularly in London 9, 10, and as mentioned in the script in Frankfurt. So we continue to see strong momentum in the pipeline including closed deals already booking and you really see that in the really extremely strong cabinet additions particularly in Europe this past quarter.","So very pleased with that. We continue to build out the team. Jim's been successful in bringing in some really key additional members to the team. And so they're off and running, again we're building pipeline. We're advancing the financial structure discussions well. We continue to get a lot of interest from financial partners who are eager to have exposure to this sector and do so with Equinix. We're sorting through a lot of the complexities and details of what those JV structures would look like, but all-in-all continuing to see strong progress.","Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","And just to \u2013 I think what you were talking about in the other part of your question is more cross-regional bookings, and certainly as we looked at the really strong bookings quarter, we had highs in the amount that was exported between one region and another. U.S. had a very strong export quarter, but also Asia did.","And I think you were touching a little bit on it, but China Mobile, Tencent, Baidu, all of those larger service providers have continued to grow with this and spread not just to the U.S., but also to Europe.","Alex Sklar - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Thanks. Charles, one quick follow-up on the London 9 and 10, did that change at all the return profiles, given they were kind of in your existing facilities versus the purpose built ones?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","No, generally I would say that the \u2013 those implementations were consistent with the underwriting of those facilities. Remember that, I believe it's London 10 is an acquired facility, and that was really targeted. That's prior IO facility and that was targeted really with some of these kinds of footprints in mind.","So no, we feel like the underwriting is consistent \u2013 or the returns are going to be consistent with the underwriting that we had there. So again I do think that those hybrid facilities have a slightly different profile given the mix of business, but in fact those are consistent with the underwriting that we undertook.","Alex Sklar - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great, thank you.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you, Frank (sic) [Alex] (28:38). We have our next question from Colby from Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Two if I may. First off...","Operator","Your line is now open.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Can you hear me?","Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. Go ahead, Colby.","Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. Go ahead, Colby.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Two questions if I may. First question, you guys noted record bookings and at least on the more traditional business, the book-to-bill cycles typically been maybe three or six months. So I'm wondering why we aren't seeing the core businesses guidance going up for 2018, unless I guess a lot of the hyperscale may have driven that. So a little bit of color there.","And then secondly on the non-recurring portion of revenues, seems like there's some pretty strong outperformance there in the second quarter, particularly in EMEA and even more so in Asia. I think you might have touched on it in your prepared remarks, but can you just explain what drove that and what we should be expecting in the back half of the year? Thank you.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. Colby, as it relates to revenues for the second half of the year. We did increase our guidance slightly as you know and that was primarily related to the acquisitions and more specifically to Metronode.","As it relates to the record bookings, one of the things I would note, it was record bookings both on a gross basis and a net basis. And so part of it \u2013 part of what we anticipated as I said in my prepared remarks is that we had planned for this. And so in anticipation of what we needed to do to deliver a strong year, which was 9% growth normalized and on a constant currency basis, we had to have a very strong back of the year. As you recall, Q1 was a relatively soft quarter-over-quarter for us for a number of reasons, some of it which was non-recurring.","So as we look into Q3 and Q4, ultimately what you're going to see is the largest step-ups we will ever have had in our recurring revenue lines. And that's why we made that comment in the prepared remarks, but also position ourselves for what we thought would be a good exit of 2018 into 2019.","So again feel comfortable with the guidance we'd already made. We already anticipated the large step-ups. And that is offset in part by some of the churn that we've anticipated in the business, more specifically the Verizon assets, which is again continues to be flat for the rest of the year.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Keith, you had mentioned I think earlier that we should see sequential growth improve throughout 2018. I think you did 2% in the second quarter, which was up versus the first quarter. Is that still the expectation based on what you just said?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. Look, I anticipated it. Like anything else, there is a little bit of chunkiness to what we're doing. Charles alluded to some of the large hyperscale deals. There are these what we refer to as HIT oriented transactions that we booked into the London and Frankfurt campuses.","But there's a number of other transactions or bookings that we've done with these large hyperscalers that are below what we refer to as our threshold target, which is less than a megawatt of activity.","And so there's a number of circumstances where the complexity of the transaction is such that the time that we recognize the booking to the time that we recognize the revenue is slightly different. And so there's a combination of things that are taking place. But I go back to the fact that it's going to be a little bit wait and see, but we believe that we'll have the best recurring quarters we've ever had in our history in Q3 and Q4.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","And then on non-recurring?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Non-recurring, again I think strong non-recurring for Q3. And we've made an assumption for Q4 that it would step down slightly. But overall, again non-recurring revenue is a component of our overall revenue. As we said we're still targeting roughly 5%. And that's what we're going to continue to assume at this point. So again expect a little bit of a step down in Q4, and that's embedded in our guidance.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","So 3Q looks a lot more like 2Q?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yes, it does.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next questions will be coming from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. You may proceed.","Philip A. Cusick - JP Morgan","Hi, thanks very much. You noted record bookings. How should we think about the timing of when those lead to an acceleration in revenue with sort of the high end of that 8% to 10%? And has there been any change in the timing of book-to-bill as your business has expanded globally?","Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Well, as we noted, certainly this bookings is resulting in an MRR step-up that we haven't seen before. So that's certainly a direct result of that. So you're seeing an acceleration in MRR as you look at the back half of the year unfold. The other question was?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Well, on book-to-bill.","Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","I would say that I think book to bill depends a little bit on deal type and mix. So sometimes you get a more \u2013 slightly more protracted book-to-bill on the larger opportunities because they take a bit of time to sort of ramp in and scale. And there's some complexity to implementing sort of deals of that size.","So it all depends, I think that's all baked into the guidance in terms of how we see the back half playing out. And as we said I think we're looking at record quarters from an MRR step up standpoint in terms of the history of the company in the last \u2013 in the back half of the year.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","And Phil the one thing I just want to add to what PVC and Charles have said. If you actually look at the implied growth relative to the guidance we delivered, again you recognize we're \u2013 obviously we're offering guidance, but we target mid to \u2013 between mid and high end of the range. And so when you start to look at the guidance relative to what that implies on an annualized basis, you will see effectively a step up in growth rate.","And so when you annualize that growth rate again if you look at again to revenues in Q3, Q4, if we took the high end and you'd be above the 10% range on an annualized basis. If you go to midpoint \u2013 if you go to midpoint you're going to be more towards the low end of that range. And so we feel very good about the guidance that we're delivering and the ability to step up. And I just go back to the fact that these record bookings are implied \u2013 were implied in our prior guidance, you're going to see them we believe come through in Q3 and Q4 and a recurring revenue line.","And then a little bit of the \u2013 a little bit of volatility as always is the non-recurring activity particularly around the larger footprint of deals that we book. And so we anticipate that we'll be strong in Q3, and we're going to take a little bit of a step down in Q4, and that \u2013 that's how I think you should see the revenues play out, and it's consistent with the message of having strong record bookings this quarter on both the gross and net basis.","Philip A. Cusick - JP Morgan","That helps. Thanks very much, guys.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Your line is now open. You may proceed.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, Mary. So I've got a question about cross-connect trends by region, strong growth in the Americas and then a little bit of a step down in Asia-Pac and EMEA and I wondered what drove that?","Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. What I would say is that overall we were very happy with the momentum on the cross-connect side of things. We track pretty closely; you guys are just \u2013 you're looking at sort of the net numbers here. One of the things that we obviously watch pretty closely is both the gross and the net, and I think that the general trajectory is good for the business.","As I said any individual quarter we've always said that they can be a little bit up and down really depending on things like 100-gig migration, et cetera that are occurring. We are seeing some headwind from that and so I would say on a net basis this sort of level of 5,000 plus in aggregate is pretty good. And we're \u2013 it just depends on kind of \u2013 what kind of migration activity or other things we're seeing.","We did see again at the \u2013 on the revenue line in interconnection a little bit more of some effects of us working through the reconciliation of our install base of cross-connects post the Telecity transaction and some credits associated with sorting through that install base and what's there. So I think that affected the revenue line a little bit and perhaps the count as well. But overall, the gross additions across the regions tend \u2013 continue to be strong.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So, as the migration is maybe mostly complete in Americas, but still in the middle of the process in the other region that might explain the net comparison?","Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Well that's \u2013 that would be, I do \u2013 I would say that 100 gig migrations are probably and more advanced in the U.S. We probably work through more of those. So they are phasing, globally these things tend to do. But the other thing is that, again the reconciliation of sort of acquisition portfolio cross-connect sort of inventory is something that effects those numbers sometimes, and that tends to lag. It's one of the really long tail items in our integrations. And what you actually are seeing this quarter is still unaffected is more in Telecity markets, because we have the inventory. It is \u2013 this huge population of cross-connects that comes in through these acquisitions are inventoried one by one to reconcile them to the install base and ensure the billing records are accurate, et cetera.","And so that often sort of results in puts and takes in terms of the cross-connect count. And so you saw some of that in EMEA this quarter. But again I think the most important thing in our mind is the continued health of the interconnection value proposition, and we measure that by really gross adds. Are people continuing to buy into the full interconnection portfolio, and we're seeing that not only in cross-connects but now also in terms of momentum \u2013 continued momentum with the IX, and then really strong performance of ECX with Fabric now 10,000 plus and we added a good chunk to that this quarter in terms of virtual connections. So the interconnection portfolio I would say is performing very well.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you. Also for that latter part about the ECX Fabric. And then on EBITDA margins, it looks like you saw sequential growth in EMEA and APAC and then pressures in the U.S. and if you can maybe kind of call out some of the factors there?","Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","The U.S. is the largest component of the U.S. is related to the decision and it's always embedded in their internal plans as evidenced by our performance relative to EBITDA. There was the investment in ultimately the Verizon assets. As I said, there are three primary areas where we put more energy and invest heavily. And we anticipate that we'll continue to make those investments in Q3 and Q4 and it's really building out our operations team, our business support, do more R&M than was ever done before. And if you go back to the point of time where we originally disclosed down the 8-K, the Verizon transaction they are doing very little relative to what we do, very little R&M relative to what we would invest into meet our operating protocols. And so this is a natural output of our decision to acquire was embedded in internal plans and it's certainly included in our forecast. So there's nothing meaningful, Jonathan, that's going on here other than we're executing consistent with what we said and it has a little bit of a knock-on effect in some of the margin profiles as you look forward.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. And then lastly you mentioned in your script China Mobile, Tencent, Baidu as well as kind of Korean drivers as exports of business into other regions, and I'm wondering are these mainly sources of cabinet adds at this time or are they driving cross-connects, is there an ecosystem developing to speak of related to maybe some of the Chinese cloud players or is it too soon to be commenting on that?","Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","My reaction would be it's probably too soon or at least I haven't looked specifically at their cross-connect data to see how much traction they're having. But clearly, it's been resulting in cabinet adds as they build out their platform and with their business growth we would certainly see cross-connects associated with it. But I don't have that, I don't know I'm looking at Charles or Keith to see...","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Well, I would say, I do think that they tend to be \u2013 they come with a high absolute cross-connect count oftentimes, because the private interconnection, they include a private interconnection node along with the cloud footprint, but they also come with a lot of cabinets. And so I think they really serve our interests well strategically in terms of continuing to really enhance the overall platform value proposition. And in the end, that's really the core strategy is to continue to position Platform Equinix as sort of a central hub for people as they sort of deploy their hybrid multi-cloud architectures. And so these things really work very strongly in our favor, but they are high cabinet counts, they are high cross-connect counts. But on a cross-connect per cab basis, they're probably lower than the average, just because they're so large.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Michael, your line is now open.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Investment Research","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Two, if I could. First, as you mentioned, I think the shrink recently in indirect sales and was curious if you talk a little bit more about the types of sales that are being generated out of the indirect channels and how you see that impacting the bookings opportunity as you look out over the next six to 18 months?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Sure. I'll take a first crack at that, Mike. It's Charles. Yeah, we have really strong continued momentum in the channel overall. And I would say there's a variety of selling merchants. Right now, I still think we're seeing mostly sell with activity meaning that we're mobilizing sort of our direct teams to partner with our channel sales to \u2013 channel partner sales teams to win end user opportunities. We saw about \u2013 more than 50% of our new logos came through the indirect channel, more than 20% of our bookings coming from that.","In terms of the types of \u2013 types of opportunities to directly address your question, I would say, it really falls into; one, continued sort of network optimization type opportunities, hybrid multi-cloud as a primary use case, people are really beginning to implement that at a much more aggressive pace and doing it really typically with larger enterprise customers with whom these channel partners are well positioned from an account access and decision maker access standpoint.","So \u2013 and I think we've talked about who some of those are. For example, AT&T and other NSPs are really acting as very effective sales or channel partners for us as they sell a more comprehensive sort of connectivity and cloud sort of solution and value proposition to their customers. And a lot of momentum with the hyperscalers themselves, they are, I would say, you have a range of appetite in terms of how they view hybrid cloud, but all of them are seeing now that their big customers are saying look that's the reality. That's what I want, that's what I need. I'm going to deploy and implement significant private infrastructure.","And so, we see \u2013 with the likes of Microsoft, for example, that has Azure Stack and other really core hybrid private cloud value propositions, really strong momentum and certainly are going to a big large global multinational customers implementing hybrid cloud. So those are probably the ones, but and again AWS same thing. I think you know several years ago I would say that there was not a lot of discussion about hybrid in the context of AWS and now I would say there's a lot more. And so we are actively partnering with them to serve customers who are looking at hybrid cloud architectures. So I think those are probably some \u2013 a little color on what we're seeing there.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Investment Research","Thanks very much.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Erik your line is now open. Hello. Hello Erik. I'm sorry your line got disconnected. I'm sorry. We have Jeff Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. Sir you may now begin.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet","Hi. Can you hear me?","Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Yes.","Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.","Yes, we can.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet","Okay, great. I'm hoping to probe a little bit more on the interconnection revenues if you could. You obviously have given us some qualitative sense about why things are lumpy up or lumpy down and in this case maybe lumpy down. I'm wondering if you could add a little bit of qualitative or quantitative color to that or help us gauge how quickly you think that interconnection revenue should be growing over the course of time, whether it's absolute figure or relative to co-lo revenue or anything that will help us think that through would be wonderful.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, you want to take the first crack.","Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Well, I was just going to make the comment. We're just continuing to see it outpace the co-location business and feel good about the prospects of that continuing in terms of just all our selling activity and the nature of customers that we're bringing on board a bit, highly interconnection focused.","Clearly this quarter the \u2013 a lumpy down, I like your term, some due to specific, as Charles outlined, just billing clean-up and counts in the Telecity centers in Europe had some impact on that growth. But we're just continuing to see it at a growth level, 5,000 to 7,000 cross-connect adds every quarter, and that just continues to move forward with us.","So certainly some churn has come from the 100-gig upgrades, but ultimately the momentum of cross-connects is just continuing, and we'll continue to see it outpacing colocation.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet","So would it be fair to say then that a 5,000 to 7,000 per quarter growth rate is plus or minus steady state, aside from some of these clean-ups?","Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","That's what it's been, yes.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's right and I think we're seeing more of the low-end on that because we are seeing some of the 100-gig migrations coming through with larger cross-connect count customers.","And so that does \u2013 but I will tell you that in terms of when we look at the health of the overall gross additions, in terms of cross-connect adds as well as just broader interconnection adds across the ECX Fabric, and IX as well, we really see strong sort of metrics both in terms of customer count there, then percentage of customers that are buying across the portfolio, the number of locations in which they're buying.","All those things which we sort of view as central to the health of the interconnection business overall are pointed in the right direction. So yeah, I think 5,000 to 7,000 is a reasonable sort of steady state for us, and we're probably operating a bit more at the low end right now because of the some of the 100-gig pressures.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet","Okay. Thank you. Super helpful. Thank you.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. We have now Erik Rasmussen from Stifel. Erik, your line is now open.","Erik Peter Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Can you hear me?","Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Yes, welcome back.","Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.","Yes. Go ahead.","Erik Peter Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Sorry about that, I'm not sure what happened. Thanks. Just two quick. First, I guess in terms of the Infomart in Dallas, you had that now closed in the quarter. You seeing any positive surprises to your prior expectations? And then what are your plans for the adjacent land and timeline for future development?","And then in terms of the interconnection, obviously we're talking about 100-gig right now. But the industry continues to migrate and we're even hearing 400-gig. Is this also coming up more with discussions with your customers?","Peter F. Van Camp - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. So the first one on Infomart, no real surprises to the upside. But coming into it, we knew our investment in expansions that we planned there, we're going to deliver the upside growth in the Infomart acquisition.","Clearly we did it for the strategic value of the interconnection hub that's sits there and the opportunity that that Dallas market presents from a just overall co-location and interconnection standpoint.","So yes, we're moving on the next phase of the Infomart. Dallas 6, I believe, is the current count. But we're also doing the groundwork to look at expansions and take advantage of that parking lot to do something more meaningful, both at a retail and hyperscale level. And so that work is underway, but nothing to announce from a specific investment standpoint as yet on those expansions. But really a lot of the upside with Dallas will be about our expansions in that market.","And then on 400-gig, we're not seeing or hearing anything from customers to that end as yet. We've continued to live through a number of upgrades. 10-gig was a big step years ago and now of course at 100-gig, I don't see anything from 400-gig on the horizon anytime really soon.","Erik Peter Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have Aryeh Klein from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. You may proceed.","Aryeh Klein - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Just going back to the interconnection revenues, is the reconciliations with Telecity a one quarter phenomenon? Should we expect it to bounce back relatively quickly?","And then it looks like you had a couple of push outs on some projects including in Paris. Is there anything notable related to those?","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","No, I'll hit last one, and Keith, if you want talk at all about the first one. But the last one, relative to Paris, it was a soils issue that resulted in a slight delay in that project. But it's nothing particularly out of the ordinary, very slight delay in that project, nothing to worry about.","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","And, Aryeh, as it relates to the reconciliation of the install base, as Charles alluded to, it's really the long tail of our integration efforts. And because we have to count every single unit to make sure we tie the physical to basically the contract and ultimately to the build, it takes an exceedingly long amount of time to do that. No different than what we've experienced in some of our prior acquisitions.","And so it's something that you should continue to expect us to do. I'm not \u2013 I don't anticipate the same level of adjustment from a \u2013 with our customers or from a revenue perspective. But you should anticipate that this is going to last many quarters, well into 2019.","Aryeh Klein - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We have Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Simon, your line is now open.","Lisa Lam - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, this is Lisa for Simon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a quick one on just how you think about your balance sheet going forward. I know you've targeted kind of 3 to 4 [times] leverage ratio and [ph] there's talks (53:41), and you continue to look for an investment grade rating. So maybe just an update on kind of the progress towards that?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, Lisa. Thanks for the question. Again, relative to what we talked about at the Analyst Day on June 20, we thought we'd be about 4.5 times levered coming out of this quarter. Number looks more like 4.3 [times], and there is a couple reasons for that. Number one, we're continuing to show progress towards our EBITDA goals, and obviously an uptick in EBITDA helps with that.","And then secondly, when we did the acquisition of the Infomart transaction, because of how we \u2013 the way it gets accounted for, we took roughly $200 million of debt off our books from built-to-suit transactions that we had previous to the acquisitions. And also given currency movements in Europe and then the fact that we've got the Informart secured senior note \u2013 I should say, the senior notes that will be paid off at $150 million a quarter. You can see over a relatively short period of time, we're going to get well into our targeted range of 3 to 4 times net leverage.","So I feel good about the progress that we're making. That all said, our appetite as again just sort of levering off of what we talked about at the Analyst Day, we're going to continue to invest across our global footprint. And with that comes a lot of capital spend, capital spend with that comes incremental raising of capital. And so as a company we're going to continue to focus on the growth and not \u2013 not that we absolutely care about investment grade, but that will continue to be aspirational because we think the way we can drive the most return to all constituents is really about by growing the business, and driving more cash flow into it. And so that \u2013 what I would tell you over that time horizon and the plan that we shared with everybody 2018 to 2022, we're well within the targeted range of becoming investment grade, simultaneously \u2013 simultaneous with investing in the business, paying our dividends, paying our taxes and scaling the business. So I'm confident we're on the right path. I'm just not confident that it's going to \u2013 we'd be investment grade over the next quarter or two. I think it's going to be a little longer than that.","Lisa Lam - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Gutman from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. You may proceed.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. As I just look at the guide \u2013 the midpoint of guidance for the full year and for the third quarter, and I just back into what's implied at the end of the year, it looks like there's an implication of an EBITDA margin bit of a step down towards end of the year, is that right, and what would that be due to?","Keith D. Taylor - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah, Rob. Look there's a lot of \u2013 we've given you relatively broad ranges as we said we're going to continue to invest in a number of areas in the \u2013 related to the Verizon assets, there's a number of integrations that are taking place. But overall when you look at, you look at how we're progressing through the rest of the year depending on whether it's mid to high point of range, we feel very comfortable what we're delivering relative to what we told you at the beginning part of the year. And so just recognize there's a little bit of comfort in the guidance that we've delivered and as we continue to progress through the quarter and into Q4, we'll give you certainly updated color at that point in time. But overall, it's just \u2013 it's a manifestation of hopefully the range that we provided giving ourselves a little bit more flexibility.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Jonathan, your line is now open.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Just a follow-up on the channel comment and passing the 20% benchmark, I'm assuming that a lot of that business is sourced from the U.S. including into other regions, but I wondered if there was anything to call out in terms of channel contributions that came from within EMEA or within Asia-Pac.","Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.","Yeah. Actually, no, I would say that our mix of business on the channel is actually quite good, so I don't have at top of my head exactly how big the range is in terms of percentage of bookings from channel, but it's not like that was \u2013 that 20% is really a big over indexing in one particular region. So all three of the regions now are fairly well advanced in the development of the channel program. It probably looks slightly different in terms of the exact partners because I think that partners do tend to be a bit more regional in their scope of business. We do have some really big global channel partners certainly, but a lot of the activity does come from more localized partners. I'm personally very energized about how the channel program is progressing. And one of the things that's really for folks who've been around these things over time is you have to build the level of confidence in the sales team that channel is good for them. When you have a direct selling team and that's your history and legacy, it is actually often difficult for them to gain a level of \u2013 to sort of trust and credibility, or for the channel to gain trust and credibility with them and vice versa to that matter \u2013 for that matter.","But I think we're really seeing that now and as we add talent to our team in terms of \u2013 we're now 460 plus quota-bearing hedge, many of those have been added over the last several years and we try very hard to add people who are sophisticated multi-channel sellers and they get it. They understand how channel partners can be effective for them in sort of meeting their quotas. So \u2013 and again that's strong across the board across the three regions.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Charles J.

Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter earnings call.","As you can see in our results, we continue to enjoy significant momentum in our business. Our ability to deliver distinctive and durable value for our customers as they pursue their digital transformation agenda is feeling strong bookings performance and accelerated new logo capture.","Our platform continues to be highly differentiated due to our superior global reach, vast operating scale and the power of our interconnection platform, separating us from other data center providers and positioning us as the trusted center of the cloud first world.","We continue to execute well against our strategy, achieving our second best gross bookings quarter with incremental deals for more than 3,000 of our customers and strong cross-border bookings driven largely by the Americas team.","We achieved our 66 consecutive quarter of revenue growth, tops among S&P 500 companies, and we now serve more than half of the Fortune 500. With a record number of Fortune 500 and Global 2000 prospects, still in the pipeline.","The diversity, volume and velocity of our selling engine continues to shine. Generating over 4,000 deals in the quarter, with the majority comprised of small to mid-sized multi metro deals, reflecting the tremendous health of our interconnection centric retail business and foreshadowing future land and expand opportunities, as these customers use Equinix as the nexus for implementing their hybrid and multicloud aspirations.","Our global reach continues to fuel our top-line with revenue from customers deployed across all three regions ticking up to 61% and multi-region revenues at 73%. We saw substantial progress against the six priorities I outlined at the start of the year, including evolving our portfolio of products, expanding our go-to-market engine including channel and delivering on our hyperscale strategy.","We signed our first hyperscale JV a greater than $1 billion deal with GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund targeting development projects across Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris to serve the unique core workload deployments for a targeted group of hyperscale companies. And we continue to expand our global platform with 30 projects underway including 5x scaler builds and Q2 openings in all three regions, including Chicago, Madrid, Osaka, Perth, Seattle, Sofia, and Tokyo.","Digital transformation continues to be a top priority for our customers in a variety of key trends are making them think differently about their infrastructure. We are responding to this changing demand by both investing across our traditional strengths and layering in incremental capabilities.","We are expanding our data center footprint enhancing our market-leading interconnection platform and have now launched the first offering in our planned and services portfolio. Positioning Equinix as an easier to use, more valuable and more accessible platform and driving attach rates that will help us sustain and enhanced cabinet yields over the coming years.","Turning to the quarter. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q2 were $1.385 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 12% year-over-year and AFFO was meaningfully ahead of our expectations due to strong operating performance.","Our interconnection platform continues to perform well, once again, outpacing collocation revenues growing 13% year-over-year, as our ecosystems continue to scale. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis.","We now have 348,000 interconnections over four-times more than the next closest competitor. In Q2, we added an incremental 7,000 interconnections with strong growth in virtual connections. For our Internet exchange platform, we are seeing strength in the APAC and EMEA markets with IX provision capacity up 30% year-over-year.","ECX Fabric, our SDN-enabled interconnection service now has over 1600 customers. We are seeing increasing adoption of ECX for new use cases, including a diversification of ICX end destinations and more frictionless hybrid multicloud deployments enabled by API level integration between ECX and market-leading cloud and network providers.","In Q2, we also launched Network Edge services and NFV offer that provides enterprises a faster, easier and more efficient way to deploy virtual network services at Equinix, as we extend our portfolio of interconnection offerings.","Customers can choose virtualized services such as routers, firewalls and load balancers from industry leading partners, including Cisco, Juniper and Palo Alto Networks. Early customer response has been great. We have a healthy pipeline ahead and we are working to build out the service offering with additional partners and locations over the coming quarters.","Now let me cover some highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical experienced solid bookings led by growth in EMEA and strong resale activity from our top global network partners.","We also continue to deepen our network density, with over 1800 networks now available on Platform Equinix, including every network provider in the Fortune 500 and 90% of those in the Global 2000. New wins included a Chinese telecom provider serving 40% of China's Internet users and Wander, a U.S. regional ISP deploying infrastructure to launch wireless services for West Coast residential customers.","Our Financial Services vertical achieved record bookings led by capital Markets, banking and insurance sub segments, as firms embrace digital transformation. Expansions included a key win with CME Group, a top three global exchange, re-architecting their network and securely connecting to ecosystem partners and Hannover Life Reassurance, a top five global insurer deploying infrastructure and connecting to ECX Fabric.","The Content & Digital Media vertical produced solid bookings led by the Americas and strong growth in gaming and publishing sub-segments. Expansion wins included Akamai, a top content distributor extending coverage and scale and supporting existing security solutions. And Zynga a leading mobile gaming developer expanding across Platform Equinix to support enterprise IT.","Our Cloud & IT vertical captured record bookings led by the APAC region and the infrastructure in services sub-segments. Equinix continues to be the leading solution for cloud connectivity today, with over 40% of all cloud on-ramps from the top cloud service providers in our IBX's across our metros.","Expansions this quarter included a Fortune 75 technology company hosting unified communication services and service now, expanding its footprint to support its rapidly growing customer base.","Our enterprise vertical experienced diversified growth with particular strength in travel, legal and healthcare sub-segments. New wins included a global build and operator of toll roads enabling IoT smart transportation systems and Tapestry Premium, a leading fashion brand, implementing a multi-cloud strategy as well as expansions, with the top three food services company re-architecting their network to enable data access and analytics.","Our channel business had another great quarter with broad-based strength driving over 25% of bookings and accounting for 60% of our new logos, as we deepen our engagement with high priority partners to significantly amplify our go-to-market reach.","We are focusing our efforts and driving more productivity and joint offer creation across our reseller and alliance partners, which include Amazon, AT&T, Microsoft, Oracle, Orange, Telstra, Verizon and WWT. New channel win this quarter included a win with Telstra for Genomics England solving for cloud connectivity to increase computing, storage and resiliency.","Now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.","Keith Taylor","Great. And thanks, Charles. And good afternoon to everyone.","While after a very strong Q4 to enter the year, followed by our best ever first quarter, it's great to now discuss the continued momentum we see in the business has reflected in our Q2 results. We had better than expected gross and net bookings in the quarter, including strong cross-border activity in addition to healthy core operating metrics.","This is simply another positive indication that our strategy is bearing fruit as Platform Equinix continues to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. As a result, we are raising 2019 guidance across the board including a substantial raise in our key AFFO and AFFO per share metrics due to better than expected revenue performance and improved operating leverage in the business.","And as you might expect, we are delighted to have received our second investment grade - investment grade credit rating from Fitch, a clear recognition of our efforts to improve our debt leverage and liquidity position.","Also this quarter, we are very excited to announce our hyperscale JV partnership with GIC. This joint venture will provide us the opportunity to make significant capital investments to capture targeted and strategic large footprint deployments, while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet.","Upon closing of the joint venture, we expect to receive net cash proceeds from the sale of our London 10 and Paris 8 IBXs and other development properties, as well as other proceeds related to the reimbursement of net cost incurred and fees earned from the joint venture. We are delighted to be partnering with GIC and we will continue to work hard to close the transaction in Q3.","Now let me cover the quarterly highlights. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and a constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $1.385 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year, reflecting better-than-expected recurring revenues and lower than expected non-recurring revenues due in part to the mix of small and medium-sized deals closed in the quarter.","As we have stated before, NRR activity is inherently lumpy. We expect NRR as a percent of revenues to decrease modestly from current levels for the second half of 2019 consistent with our comments on the prior earnings call.","Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $677 million, up 12% over the same quarter last year and better than our expectations, largely due to strong recurring revenue performance and timing of certain costs incurred.","Over the second half of the year despite the increased adjusted EBITDA guidance, we expect it to continue to invest in our growth and scaling initiatives, which includes expansion drag related to new markets and leases, while it also incurring higher utility spend across the platform.","Global Q2 AFFO was $498 million, a 14% increase over the same quarter last year, largely due to strong operating flow through and lower net interest expense. Recurring capital expenditures increased $16 million over the prior quarter as planned. Q2 global MRR churn was 2.4% better than expected. We expect MRR churn to remain within our guided range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter over the remainder of the year.","Now turning to regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC and EMEA were the fastest MRR growing regions at 17% and 13% respectively on a year-over-year normalized basis, followed by the Americas region at 5%.","The Americas region saw continued momentum, including strong net bookings, solid pricing, as reflected in our MRR per cabinet metric and a high mix of small deals including a healthy level of cross-border activity. It's fair to say the Americas region fully embraces the global platform vision and remains a strong source of deal flow for the other two regions.","Our EMEA region had another very strong quarter, led by our UK and Dutch businesses. We saw robust increase in billable cabinets and interconnections. As you are aware, we have been opening meaningfully new capacity across our flap and emerging markets and nicely consuming this inventory.","We opened new capacity in London, Madrid and Sofia this past quarter. And Asia Pacific region delivered solid bookings across the region, mostly driven by small to medium-sized deals led by our Singapore and Australia businesses. And we booked our first deal into our soon to open sole IBX.","And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our unrestricted cash balance is approximately $1.6 billion, flat over the last quarter, as the operating cash flow and proceeds from the ATM program were offset by higher capital expenditures, debt repayment and our quarterly cash dividend.","Our balance sheet and liquidity position continues to create a strategic advantage for us. Our net debt leverage ratio dropped to 3.4-times at Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA, well within our targeted range. Our strategic strength, lower debt leverage, increased asset ownership and a commitment to use both debt and equity to fund our future growth, drove our second investment grade rating from Fitch and establish us as a full-fledged investment grade rated company. Reaching this milestone ensures that we have market access to a deeper pool of investors at a lower cost of capital and provides a greater set of immunity to the macroeconomic environment we now operate in.","We also expect to drive substantial interest rate savings into the business over the next few years, both as we refinance our current outstanding debt load and as we borrow new incremental funds to invest in our future growth initiatives.","Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $444 million including recurring CapEx of $37 million. We opened seven new builds, including two new IBXs, one in Sofia and the other in Tokyo.","For the quarter, we added 3300 cabinets to our available inventory and we continue to purchase land for future expansion. This quarter we acquired land for development in Madrid. Lastly, revenues from owned assets remained at 55%.","And our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 138 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, an improvement over the prior quarter. Our stabilized asset count increased by net four IBXs, as we are now including the applicable Metronode assets in our stabilized account. The stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and now generate a 30% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.","Finally, refer to Slides 11 through 15 for updated summary of 2019 guidance and bridges. Please note that quarter-over-quarter growth rates for both revenues and adjusted EBITDA are now updated to include the expected impact of the hyperscale joint venture closing in the third quarter and certain other one-time adjustments, as shown in our earnings deck.","For the full year 2019, after absorbing a $7 million reduction in revenue attributed to the sale of our IBXs to the EMEA hyperscale JV, we're raising revenue guidance by $10 million and our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $15 million, primarily due to strong operating performance in the business.","This guidance applies a revenue - implies a revenue growth rate of 9% year-over-year and a healthy adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 48%. Also we are reducing our 2019 integration cost to $11 million, a $2 million reduction.","And given the operating momentum of the business, we continuing to improve our AFFO and our AFFO per share metrics. After absorbing a net $5 million reduction in AFFO from the sale of our IBXs to the joint venture, we're raising our 2019 AFFO by $25 million, a growth rate between 13% and 14% compared to the previous year, largely due to strong adjusted EBITDA performance and a lower net interest expense.","AFFO per share is expected to grow between 8% and 9%, which includes the dilutive impact from both our ATM program and the prior equity raise. We have assumed a weighted average 84.6 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. And we expect 2019 cash dividends to now increase to approximately $825 million, a 13% increase over the prior year and reflects an 8% increase year-over-year on a per share basis.","So with that, I'm going to stop here and turn the call back to Charles.","Charles Meyers","Thanks Keith.","In closing, we're delighted with the performance of the business and we continue to execute with focus and urgency against our priorities. We see a large and expanding market opportunity and believe we are uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity, as customers embrace digital transformation and adopt hybrid and multi-cloud as their architecture of choice.","We remain confident that the reach and scale of our global platform, the breadth of our ecosystems, the strength of our interconnection portfolio and the depth of our balance sheet will allow us to further extend our market leadership.","We are continuing to scale our go-to-market engine and will maintain our focus on operating leverage, balancing margin expansion with additional investment in developing innovative new services and curating a robust partner ecosystem that will help us drive top-line growth and sustain our industry-leading return on capital.","We remain firmly focused on building a company that attracts, inspires and develops the best talent in our industry, delivering distinctive and durable value to our customers and sustainable long-term value creation to our shareholders.","Bottom line, the Company is executing well on a highly differentiated strategy to become the trusted center of the cloud-first world. We're excited about the road ahead and look forward to sharing our continued progress.","Let me stop there and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Philip Cusick","Let's talk about the company sort of potential to grow either organically or inorganically from here. Outside of price, what are the important strategic characteristics that drive your decision to do acquisitions from here? And are there significant holes left in the portfolio? You've moved into South Korea in the last year, what else is left that you really need to do? Thank you.","Charles Meyers","Sure. Phil, I'll start and Keith can add on as needed. Look, I mean, we definitely think there are substantial remaining growth opportunities for the business both organically and non-organically. I think in particular, I think, I'd focus on the organic side, which is the - our customers are responding exceptionally well to our value proposition, we're seeing strong bookings growth, new logo capture and really strong land and expand activity with those customers. So, we're going to continue to focus on that as our primary growth factor.","That said, I do think that there are, we've said it on multiple occasions, we think M&A is still a tool in the toolkit for us. We have said that we think there are gaps in the platform in terms of our opportunities to expanded and add to our market leadership in terms of global reach.","We've talked specifically about a couple of opportunities areas, where our customers are asking us about our future plans. Those include India. Eventually I think they include the African continent for us, and probably another - other select opportunities, including potentially Mexico as an opportunity for us south of the border here.","And so I think there, as you said, well there is - we'll have to look at those carefully in terms of understanding the price for those assets that might be available and we'll be disciplined about that, but I do think that those represent an opportunity for us for growth.","Keith Taylor","Phil I've just said, what I'd add on just to what Charles said is, there's two other things it's certainly come to the top of my mind, it's new products and services. And Charles alluded to NFP as one example of a new service that we're going to deliver, but we're going to continue to invest around product and service offerings and think of that is a potential for growth.","Certainly continuing to invest in included that is the hyperscale initiative, albeit it's going to be in the JV in the majority of that, the growth at least on a cash flow basis would come below the line.","And then the last thing that sort of you feel it today's for certain given the macro environment, we're operating in and with the strength of the U.S. dollar as a reminder, 60% of the business in rough numbers is outside of the U.S. and we've got a, with a strong dollar policy and soon to be maybe a weaker U.S. dollar policy on a go-forward basis.","There is an opportunity on a currency basis, as our hedges flush out that I would provide an element of growth, whether it's the Brexit - no matter how we think about Brexit and the implications of that and how that's affected our revenue base out of the UK to other markets in Europe and beyond. So, I think there is a lot of opportunity for growth in addition to what Charles has alluded to.","Philip Cusick","That's really interesting on the currency side. if I can follow-up once, should we think of new capabilities is a sort of relatively small tuck-on acquisitions to really drive the internal knowledge of the company? Or do you think of bigger service acquisitions as possible? Thank you.","Charles Meyers","Well, I think that in terms of our edge services portfolio, which is probably, we're going to continue to grow the interconnection portfolio in terms of reach in services and feature function and then the edge services portfolio. The first one off the line so to speak, is the Network Edge, which is a little bit of a blend between interconnection and these edge services.","But I think that we are going to, we probably will look at augmenting our capabilities, potentially through targeted M&A, but I think that we'll be looking at a lot of organic development in that portfolio initially. And over time, we'll have to determine, whether or not that warrants a more aggressive posture there from the services addition standpoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Ari Klein","It sounds like you're seeing some better momentum in the Americas. Can you talk a little bit about that market, what are you seeing there and how you kind of expect that growth rate to maybe improve over the next few quarters?","Charles Meyers","Sure. Yes, I think what you know the Americas business for us continues to be an exceptional attractive business, its size, the profitability of that business. If you look at it from a MRR per cab standpoint at almost $20 for a cab. It's really an exceptional business, large number of customers and really good traction from the selling team, not only selling our capacity local to that market, but as a huge outbound engine for the rest of the world.","And so, we're super pleased with the performance of the business. It is growing at a rate that's probably roughly in line with the broader retail colocation market. But in some respects, I think that's a bit of an unfair comparison, because we are - what I would say is our real addressable market is, the market opportunity for colocation services that deliver a 30% cash-on-cash yield.","And I'll tell you our share in that business is substantially higher than then it's a vary to the high share and in terms of being able to grow that business at market rate is, I think an impressive accomplishment.","So, we still are seeing a little bit of headwinds from the tail of churn in Verizon assets in particular, we talked about that, it just continues to take a little bit longer to come out than we had anticipated. Again net-net, that's a good thing, but it does create some a little bit of headwind in that business.","But yes, we see good success. And I think now, as we add new services like Network Edge and some of the other things, I think we're going to continue to have the opportunity to sustain that business in a very positive way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Jon Petersen","I wanted to talk about the GIC joint venture in Europe. You guys have been a little bit coy about the details. I think towards the end in Keith remarks you said is about a $5 million net impact to AFFO for the balance of the year. But I'm hoping you can maybe give us just a little more details on what we should expect for the balance of the year and then kind of the growth of that JV over the next couple of years.","Keith Taylor","Sure. Jon, let me start off, I just want to make sure there's a clarifying comment. So, when we talk about the $5 million impact, that is basically from us selling the assets to the JV, so we're reducing our AFFO by $5 million because of that. That all said, as you're all aware, we are going to close the transaction in Q3 and we'll certainly update you on the next earnings call with all the specific details.","But suffice it to say, there is a number of things that are going to happen and the first thing that's going to be important for everybody note, is the amount of cash proceeds that come back into the business, given the sale of our Paris or London 10 and Paris 8 assets.","And again, we've said that we're going to get add market or better cap rate on basically the recovery of our cash flow. We're going to get reimbursement of fees, reimbursement of costs, but we're also going to get our stake our 20% equity interest in the joint venture. And so we're excited about that opportunity.","We've announced the two assets that will go in to the stabilizers, potentially out of the gate for more, as we've highlighted in the earnings deck. But then we're going to be active elsewhere in the world. And we really want to be clear, this is not about getting into wholesale business. This is about us being very, very strategic by the decisions we make that would add value to the overall franchise on our platform.","And so we'll be very transparent about the deals that we do. We will share with the market. But they're going to be - there's going to be a number of different JVs that will be established over the coming quarters and years that will give you a good sense of the momentum and that value will come in typically through the income from affiliated entities, which will be below the line.","Some of the fees will be the fee income that we earn from the JV will be on the top-line. And again, it will be typically and typically on the top-line, but I will just be with the fee income. So, there's a lot of discussion still to be add here, the deals got to close, but we're very optimistic about the decisions we're making and we're delighted by I'll get out with our partner. I think they're going to be a great global partner for us that we will go to almost any market that choose to partner in.","Jon Petersen","And then just maybe one follow-up. I'm curious about the decision you - I guess essentially bringing GIC as a development partner to kind of share in the development like through the whole process versus finding more of a takeout partner, where you can develop on your own balance sheet and then sell into a joint venture, once it's stabilized, which I assume would probably carry a lower cap rates. Just curious your thought process around how you wanted that capital to come in?","Charles Meyers","Yes. I think first recognizing is the first two projects, which are stabilized, we're going to get full return for the investment decisions we've made, including all of the development profit associated with those assets. That's said on a go-forward basis, our decision is not to take what we think it is very dear capital and try and use that as a means to fund a low returning business.","We think partnering with GIC, we're happy to share on those development profits because our focus is really on adding to the overall global platform, in the retail business and we're going to consume all the capital that we have in our balance sheet and more as we shared in the last Analyst Day on growing the retail business.","So, this is about making a good decision, driving value into our shareholder base and at the same time augmenting, and I said - I've said on a number of - at a number of investment meetings, between the new services, which includes the hyperscale and the new interconnection services. We're not only sort of widening our mode, we're also deepening the mode around our business.","And I think that's just a good use of our capital and let our partner participate with us and appropriate returns. We'll get outsized returns because the fee income that get attached to, to those levered returns.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Colby Synesael","I just have two modeling questions actually. One is on the ATM the $348 million that you raised in the quarter, a bit surprised just considering you just done the equity raise the quarter before. Can you give us any color on expectations further range of this year to extent possible. And then secondly cabinet and cross connects they were down quarter-over-quarter and just taking into consideration the developments and how much you are building out, any color on what we can expect for both cross connects and talk about physical, cross connects and cabinets as we go into the back half of the year as well? Thank you.","Keith Taylor","Why don't I take the first one, Colby and Charles will take the second. One on the ATM, we've always said that we would use it appropriately at the right time. And as a Company we knew what our funding needs where between now and the end of the year and as we looked into 2020 and we always felt that there would be a little - that always be a little bit of ATM that we take off the table at the right time and certainly with market conditions being as volatile as they were, I was doing this deal take using this ATM at roughly an average price of $485 a share. We thought it was the right thing to do.","Having said that, in my prepared remarks, I really wanted to - I was trying to highlight our new ones that as we look forward a lot of our capital needs will come from debt. So, we want to make sure that we continue to balance that debt.","The capital scores with debt and equity, but this was a unique opportunity because one, we knew that we could get to the market - the market. We've got a good price for to sell the equity for our shareholders. Yet at the same time, it also assured us of that second investment-grade rating.","And so you saw the market reaction after that, it was very, very positive. And ultimately when I step back and now reflect on what we potentially could do to save from an interest perspective, we historically said, it could be $100 million, I believe today given market conditions and also because of that second investment grade rating that number can now be between $100 million, say $130 million, $140 million of cash interest savings over some period of time.","And that's, what really excited us, it's making sure that we have the liquidity position, the strong balance sheet, we'll use the ATM sparingly, but on a go-forward basis. I would tell you - absent any M&A or any other sort of strategic thing, we would typically focus more on debt than anything else at this point.","Charles Meyers","And then I will take the second one Colby. Relative to cabinets, we feel very good about the momentum in the business. We've always said that sort of cab adds is one that can be a little lumpy in depending on timing and various other factors and so. We really encourage folks to look at sort of rolling four quarter average as sort of an indication the health of our ability to translate capacity into sort of utilized and billable cabinets.","And when you look at that we think that the trajectory across all three regions continues to be very strong. And again we have added a lot of capacity. It is also it is important to note that we're doing that with a very attractive deal mix. And so large deals are a way to add a lot of cabinets, there's just not a way to add as much value. And so, I think what you're seeing is shifting in our mix and is still being able to deliver the cabinet additions that we think are appropriate and attractive by doing that at much higher returns.","And so we feel good about that overall and again, we encourage you to really look primarily at the rolling four quarter average as the primary metric. And then relative to interconnection and cross connect - physical cross connects in particular. Solid quarter we were sort of right at the bottom end of our range. I do think that we\u2019re seeing a little bit of the continued 10 to 100 Gig migration sort of impacts in terms of slowing that down a little bit, but gross adds continue to be very strong.","And when you combine that and you look at then you add in the virtual I think you're seeing a number that looks very good. And recognize that both of them are very important to us and actually with very similar economics. We talked about that previously, which is our ARPU and return profile on virtual interconnection is actually every bit as good as physical. And so it's a matter of just the customers choosing a - different tools for different jobs, so to speak. And so I do think that we're going to see.","I think - we kind of stick by our prior views on the sort of evolution of 10 to 100 Gig migration flattening out at the end of this year. And we think that will represent some upside in the Americas as we go into next year. So interconnection overall, we feel great about 13% year-over-year growth. I think we're seeing some improvements in pricing globally and again strong performance on the platform overall.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Frank Louthan","Can you comment a little bit on the Americas business and what you're seeing in pricing, particularly in Northern Virginia and then I have a follow-up?","Charles Meyers","Sure yes, I think that revolves around the, some of the others who have reported some of the challenges in Northern Virginia, which I think revolve primarily around the hyperscale business and large footprint capacity and sort of the supply-demand dynamics of that business. I think that as we've said in the past, we're kind of taking a pass on playing in that market relative to hyperscale in Northern Virginia.","Instead, we\u2019re kind of the center of that universe relative to interconnection and relative to sort of the overall ecosystem in that market, which again continues to be the largest teller market in the world and so. So I think there is going to be, I think there is some sorting out at the hyperscale side is impacting pricing, but it's not really having significant effect on our business there, which we continue to see strong levels of interconnection, good solid cabinet yields in pricing and feel like we really play out a differentiated position there in terms of the center of that ecosystem.","Frank Louthan","I believe you will raise pricing in Europe earlier in the year, was that pretty much - if those price - increase is pretty much played out - the quarter is anymore to bleed in to impact the back half?","Charles Meyers","Now they're going to bleed in actually over a long period of time. We took a very measured approach in terms of how we wanted to go about normalizing those to what we thought were appropriate market rates. And we did that for a variety of reasons because we really value the long-term relationship with the customers who want to do that in a way that is measured. But we also want to make sure that we're getting a fair return on what we think is an exceptionally high value service.","And so, the way we've done that as we've rolled them in at renewals typically. And so, they're coming in as - and we've already changed the price on new adds. And so, those will begin to obviously to have an impact. And then others will roll in and renewals over the coming quarters and years. So, it will be a bit of a slow growth there, but we think it will have a positive impact and sort of ongoing lift in that business.","Frank Louthan","Any competitive reaction from that?","Charles Meyers","No I think, well I think that, what we've seen is that there is general stability in that market in terms of people delivering. I think there has been some upward lift in the overall market pricing. And so, and again I think that's a reflection of the value delivered to the customer and so. So overall, it seems to be going well.","Operator","Next we will hear from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.","Tim Horan","Well, thanks guys. The 40% of all cloud on ramps could you just elaborate on that a little bit, what do you mean by that. And do you think that's been growing as a percentage of share and will platform Equinix is that designed to capture more of those on ramps broadly speaking? Thanks.","Charles Meyers","Yes, it's a great question. We will - I don't know that will continue to grow share on the - on-ramps because I think that we - most of the providers are looking for some level of redundancy and they're looking for often times multiple on-ramps in a market. They've very frequently led with us. And so that is why I think we jumped out with a very large share position. And so, I think we can continue to grow with them. And as our geographic footprint expands, hopefully continue to maintain very, very high market share ratings there.","If you look at it in terms of a coverage - from a coverage standpoint in the markets in which we operate, we have a 70% coverage of on-ramps with the - largest cloud service providers and 40% share overall. So it's going to continue to be an area of focus for us. We think that the combination of us being able to continue to invest in sort of the retail-centric portions of our hyperscale relationships with Equinix.","And focus our balance sheet firepower on that. And then being able to leverage the strength of our X scale JV with GIC to pursue the large footprint is really absolutely spot on and the right strategy for us. And we think we're going to continue to play a very differentiated position in the overall cloud ecosystem.","Tim Horan","And can you add many new products to platform Equinix and I guess, can it be like a material business for you?","Charles Meyers","Yes and yes, I think that the edge services portfolio that we're looking at I think network edge services is absolutely capable of being a meaningful contributor to the topline over a period of years and as we look at other augmentations to our edge services portfolio. I think, we absolutely think those can be meaningful additions. And we think that they can come at attach rates strong attach rates and low cost to sale that we think will prove out to be very, very attractive economics. And will be able - to allow us to sustain return on invested capital at our market leading rates.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simon Flannery","I think and Keith you talked about on the EBITDA, some delayed spend, can you just give us a little bit more color around that. And then, just coming back to your comment on the currencies, can you just remind us of the hedges that you have right now and what the remaining term - do you have any hedges that extend deep into 20 or is it pretty much say 6, 9 months left on the existing hedges? Thanks.","Keith Taylor","I think as it relates to EBITDA, and when we talk about delayed spend. Again as a company as you recognize, we've been able to increase our EBITDA guidance this year relative to the beginning of the year, roughly $45 million and $70 million at AFFO line. And part of that of course is timing and timing relates to things that we talked about at the outset when we highlighted some of the areas that we - expose the P&L to this year, it was about expansion growth at a rate that we've never seen before.","Through the second half of the year, you're going to see some of those costs come in whether Seoul or Hong Kong, Singapore, where we're making substantial investments for future opportunity and those costs will run through the P&L. Now our affect is by roughly $7 million through the second half of the year incrementally. And then utility spend as we've said, utilities are going up and we felt it. We've experienced a lot of it both from a pricing perspective and a consumption perspective, and that's going to hit us by roughly another $7 million.","So there's $14 million of costs that we anticipate at least we've embedded into our guidance that reflect that outcome. As it relates then to just currency, we hedge out typically over eight quarters. And as you can see in the stated guidance that we delivered with our press release, you can see that we breakdown our - what I call the blended rates. So not only the spot, but also the hedge rate and right now with the euro is roughly at 111 and we're hedged out at 117. Pound is trading at 121 and we're hedged at 134.","And so it just gives you a sense, and I'm sorry let me size that for you. The euro is roughly 20% of our revenues and pound is 9% of our revenues. And one of the things that was really telling to me so, we've got a good hedge position. Of course, those will fall off over again in the next 6 to 8 quarters and we'll continue - to feather in future hedges and sort of smooth the impact of the currency movement. But the thing that was very telling to me is, if you think about the UK sterling alone and from pre-Brexit, sorry pre-Brexit to where we are today.","The rate differential is roughly, it was 160 when dollars to the pound and today it\u2019s roughly 120. So there is a $0.40 movement and we have $500 million roughly 9% of our revenues are $500 million just for that - for the pound to go back to its level of pre-Brexit. I mean that's roughly $170 million to us on the topline. And so, you get a sense of how substantial those currency movements have been and the impact that we've absorbed in the business over this relatively short period of time.","So we're optimistic as things get back to normal, one day whenever that one day will be. So it's hard to imagine anytime soon. You're going to see the benefit that will accrete to this business because of our diversified portfolio with a lot of growth occurring in markets outside of the U.S.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Rollins","Just thinking back a little over a year ago, you provided some long-term financial goals. And you now had a little more than a year of operating results and progress. And I'm curious how you see future performance relative to some of those annual goals, including the revenue target of 8% to 10% annually? Thanks.","Charles Meyers","Yes, Mike I think relative to our Analyst Day - what we talked about at our Analyst Day last June we continue to feel good about that. And I think that we've delivered in retrospect over the past year, plus in strong fashion relative to those expectations. And so, and I think the results today show another step in that direction. So again, I think our business is performing very well. I think we're comfortable with kind of what we had laid out there.","We think there is a huge opportunity for us. We think the addressable market is actually expanding. We think we are actually adding to it by continuing to deliver new and incremental services on top of what we're already doing. And so yes, we feel good about what we articulated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura's Instinet. Your line is open.","Jeff Kvaal","Yes, thank you very much. I'd like to follow up on Mike's question a little bit it sounded as though in your prepared remarks that your sort of organic growth is in the 3% range. And it also sounded as though your intention over time is maybe to lean, a little bit more on organic and inorganic for growth. So I guess if organic is only growing at 3% of that 8% to 10% growth rate. Are you suggesting that the organic growth should pick up a little bit with some of these new products or how should we think about that?","Charles Meyers","I think you're referencing, our stabilized asset growth at 3%. But our combined growth is much higher number. So, I think our organic growth - again we're comfortable in that in the range that we just had articulated. So, I think in fact, we just delivered a quarter that was 9% year-over-year. And so - that we feel very comfortable that the organic growth can sustain in the range that we had articulated.","Jeff Kvaal","Okay, so ongoing CapEx that makes sense?","Keith Taylor","Yes and Jeff just to be fair, I mean we have stated over a five-year period when we delivered our guidance to our investors at the June 18 Analyst Day. We said over the next five years, you should expect growth to be in eight - and this is what I call non-acquisition growth 8% to 10% on a normalized basis, normalized for currency movements and the like over that five-year period.","And that was in our CAGR it would be play in that range depending on inventory development and timing of builds and the like that. We feel, 8% to 10% is a reasonable expectation from that 2018 through 2022.","Jeff Kvaal","And then on follow-up, I think Charles, you talked a little bit about being resilient to the macro, it's been quite a while since there has been a bit of a down turn in some respects. And I'm wondering if you can sort of help us understand how your business has played in prior downcycles or how the business is different now from prior downcycles?","Charles Meyers","Well, again, I think our history in terms of our performance during downcycles has been very, very good. And so I think that - and I think the importance of the infrastructure that we provide to our customers in terms of how they operate their business I think makes it quite resilient.","I think that's particularly true as you look at how they use us in terms of thinking through things like the priorities for our customers like when we architecture, which is a way of improving the performance of their business, but also taking cost out.","And so, and as they implement hybrid and multi-cloud as a way to stretch their CapEx dollars and drive application performance those are things that we think are going to be very, very resistant to sort of fluctuations or macroeconomic conditions. So again, we feel good about the strength of our business, and I believe it will be very resilient through the macroeconomic cycles.","Keith Taylor","Jeff, let me just add one other a couple of a quick comments. First and foremost as Charles said, we love the fact that we can be resilient and we've historically thrived in periods of economic turmoil and yes, we can sort of influence how the market reacts and so at times and values at start, we certainly can take advantage of the opportunities and we've done that over the years.","The other part that I think we really tried to highlight that today being an investment grade rated company but understanding that we have $1.6 billion of cash on our balance sheet, we have an unused line of credit of $2 billion. We are generating AFFO of $1.9 billion a year that and we said we think you can grow from - it can grow meaningfully over that five-year period.","Our leverage is 3.4 times. We've just partnered with GIC for our hyperscale initiative. And our payout ratio over an extended period of time, it's going to be in the mid to sort of low to mid 40s. And so that gives us a lot of strategic flexibility as a Company and the extent thing we have to pull back.","We're absolutely weak. We've always felt we can push and pull levers as needed whether it's the operating spend or the capital spend. So we have a lot of comfort in who we are and what we're doing and as we said in the prepared remarks, we think we're strategically advantage relative to anybody else in our space.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Nick Del Deo","First, as we think about the new products and services that you're introducing or planning to introduce, are there boundaries we should consider regarding how far you're willing to push out, for example limit in terms of your willingness to hardware that customers consume virtually or services that may compete with customers, things of that nature?","Charles Meyers","Yes, what I would say is I think that we view ourselves really as an infrastructure company and I think, but I do think the ways people think about consuming infrastructure is changing and I think we have to adapt to those changing market needs and be willing to adapt the how we deliver our underlying value proposition, which is centered around global reach, ecosystem and access, interconnection and service excellence. And so I think that we will - we are probably not likely to go way up the stack.","I think we are very comfortable being an infrastructure provider that is an enabler to other people sort of broader digital transformation aspirations. We believe we unlock ecosystem value by combining our infrastructure value proposition with sort of higher layer value propositions of our partners, and I think that's proving out every day whether those be partnerships that we have with the likes of our network service provider partners or the hyperscalers themselves or other things that - we'll continue to look at further down the road.","So I think that we're going to - we're not going to go too far away from what we believe we're really good at. But I also think that we certainly wouldn't shy away from things that are slightly different than what our traditional business has been, if that's what's needed to deliver the value proposition to our customers.","So, and in terms of competitive overlap I do think that we are - we really believe that we need to continue to be that trusted partner. We have a - our business has been built on an ability to be a sort of a neutral provider that gave us people broad choice and access to a broad value proposition. And I think our strategy will still within reason need to stick to that underlying heritage.","Nick Del Deo","And then I was hoping to get a few more details on xScale, how do you determine what deployments going to xScale versus what goes into Equinix. A material amount of your current leasing shift index scale and how tight or lose the exclusivity component of the agreement with the GIC?","Charles Meyers","Yes, let me take some of them and Keith can add on as needed. But really, there is a pretty distinct difference typically in terms of a very large multi-megawatt footprint and the requirements of that for hyperscalers as they look at availabilities zone type of deployments. And they look very different than a typical either sort of on-ramp platform or network node.","And so most of that business I think on a very large side of that, we will try to direct to the xScale facilities and so because we think that's a better way to allocate our capital. And so there - there are mechanisms in place for us to evaluate that and again if we have availability of capacity in an xScale environment to take on those very large footprint we would prefer to do that just because that provides better returns overall.","Nick Del Deo","Just a follow real quick. My understanding was willing to take some larger deployments in your European footprint, you're saying that what xScale is targeting is even larger than what you've done there historically?","Charles Meyers","Well, as you look at what we did in London 10 for example that was exactly that type of footprint and it was in a hybrid facility and that now that facility is being sort of recap, being sold to the JV.","And so, yes, we were doing some of those, I mean, I do think that there are - we talked a little bit that this I neither last - is the prior earnings call or last one, or the one before that. But we've been - we selectively done some of that in our hybrid facilities in Europe. I think our preference would be to do that in the xScale data centers. That has to say it's out of the question the dynamics of the market, either from a capacity or availability standpoint would preclude us from doing something different. But given our druthers, we would prefer to move that capacity into the xScale JV.","Nick Del Deo","Okay. And then regarding the exclusivity component?","Keith Taylor","Yes, so on exclusivity and other parties exclusive to the other, but there is a lot of compelling reasons that we want to partner for allowing the extended period with each other and again there is the flexibility that we choose to do something that they are not interested in. Then, we can go do it ourselves or they can go do something their selves.","But overall, we have to be careful there is no competitive tension in the markets that we operate in. And that's sort of the understanding of the parties that we're not going to compete against each other in market, but there are - there could be markets where again one of the other chooses to be in. And the other is not interested.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Your line is open.","Erik Rasmussen","And maybe just continue with xScale. How should we think about the particulars of the xScale opportunity, especially around capacity at full build out. I know you put out in the announcement is - what do you expect the capacity of would be, but and then just a number of sites initially in relation to what was laid out at Analyst Day. Maybe just compare how that compares to what was laid out?","Charles Meyers","Yes, I think it's very much the first step along the vision of what we painted at Analyst Day. So we continue to feel like that we can, I think that if you recall that slide from there, we were talking about larger number of markets and probably 500 megawatts, I think over time. Those are things that I think are absolutely doable through a series of joint ventures, and so obviously this one covers sort of four key markets that are really we think critical to the overall ecosystem.","And as we add incremental JVs we think we'll add additional metros, and so, yes, I think the vision that we laid out is I think very, very accessible. If not, I think we can, it may even - we may even have the opportunity to grow. I think the overall collection of JVs for xScale to something that is better than that.","We think there is a big opportunity there. We think we're going to operate at the sort of deep into the demand pull there and. And so I think this is a great first step for us and several more I'm sure to come in the not too distant future.","Erik Rasmussen","And then maybe just related to that, one of the properties, that was I guess under committed and will be under development, would be in Amsterdam. And I guess it relates to what we've heard recently about the 12-month moratorium on data center construction, do you have any thoughts on the potential impact and what that might mean for this project. And maybe just in relation to others.","Charles Meyers","Yes, I mean we've - obviously the Amsterdam is a significant market for us. And in the sort of global scheme of things we've stayed very close to that. And the good news is that I think we have the runway on our projects that are already sort of grandfathered in and so we're going to have, I think plenty of capacity to keep things moving as we sort through that moratorium and I think we'll stay very close to that.","But I also think that we're going to have the opportunity, as the market leader there to a really continue to serve that market. Well, and because we have so much already committed development to do. I think we're going to be well positioned as we go through that phase.","Operator","We do have time for one more question. Our last question comes from Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Robert Gutman","Yes, thanks for taking the question. Regarding the $12 million portion of the revenue guidance that raise attributed to outperformance, can you - with any more specificity to what is performing better than plan. We've talked about a lot of stuff in this call, but it's something is going faster than you thought it would. Is it, would you say it's Europe, would you say it services uptake. Is it the channel deals is it multi-region deal demand, would you highlight anything in particular that's pushing your head faster.","Keith Taylor","So Robert I mean the 12 part of us just highlighting that is - that where we try to sort of give everybody an indication of where the strength is coming from us in the recurring element of our revenue stream. And now, it's important for us to highlight on the prepared remarks, number one, number two, when you look at our forward guide for Q3 is relatively modest to the overall guide for the second half of the year, which really is telling you that the momentum is going to come in the fourth quarter more so than that of the third quarter of based on some book-to-bill differentials and then there some one-off anomalies they're going through our results in Q3 from asset sales to how we get reimbursed for some costs with under a favorable tax ruling situation in Dallas.","But overall, I mean there is momentum right across the portfolio across the platform and we're delighted with all three regions, and how they're performing and that was really what Charles alluded to earlier on today.","Katrina Rymill","Great. That concludes our Q2 call. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."],"8489":["Equinix, Inc.

Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in an hour, we'd like to ask you, the analysts, to limit any follow-on questions to just one.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Before we walk through the results of the quarter, I'd like to reflect on the milestones that we achieved in 2014.","To start, turning to slide three, we leveraged significant market momentum to deliver another strong year of financial results generating $2.44 billion of revenue, up 14% year-over-year and over $1.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA or 46% margin, and growing AFFO 12% to $762 million.","Second, we established Equinix as the home of the interconnected cloud by partnering with an all start list of cloud providers including AWS, Cisco, Google, IBM, and Microsoft, and won business from a host of enterprises, who are taking advantage of their presence to implement hybrid cloud architectures at Equinix.","We have continued to innovate and enhance our offer set to help transform enterprise IT launching two new solutions in 2014, Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange. The traction we are seeing is very compelling, as hundreds of customers are now using these solutions to improve network and enterprise application performance as well as accelerate cloud adoption.","Third, we expanded our global platform completing 10 major IBX expansions in 2014, including projects in Amsterdam, Dallas, Sao Paulo, Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo. We are successfully creating value over the long-term through our development pipeline achieving attractive returns and healthy yield on stabilized assets with our premium value proposition.","Given the market strength, we are continuing to grow our presence in core markets. And in the first half of this year, we are opening five new IBXs in the financial and network hubs of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto, as well as a new metro in Melbourne, Australia.","Fourth, we extended our position as the global interconnection leader. With interconnection revenue continuing to outpace overall revenue, growing 16% year-over-year and further demonstrating the strength of our ecosystems. Customers interconnecting across Platform Equinix resulted in 18,500 new cross-connects in 2014 with a notable uptick in the latter half of the year, driven by strong growth to networks and acceleration in private connections to the cloud.","Our digital exchanges also saw a sizable increase in both traffic and sales, adding approximately 600 ports in 2014, about 2.5 times more adds than the prior year. And finally, we successfully began operating as a REIT on January 1 and are very pleased to announce our first quarterly dividend program. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, including raising and refinancing our high-yield notes and senior debt in the fourth quarter, and feel very good about our liquidity position and capital structure. This strategic and operational flexibility will allow for continued re-investment in our business and new market development along with distributions to our shareholders on a quarterly basis.","As we enter 2015, we see continued momentum in our core business and are well positioned to execute on emerging growth opportunities by expanding our routes to market and further enhancing our solutions portfolio. As the applications become increasingly interactive, solving complex interconnection scenarios is mission critical for today's business. We believe our global scale, as well as our network and power density puts us in a unique position to solve these challenges. Today, we have over 4,800 customers and expect to significantly expand our customer base over the next several years as Platform Equinix becomes increasingly relevant to a large universe of buyers.","Now turning to the quarter; we deliver record gross and net bookings driven by strong performance across all three regions, solid new customer additions, and continued expansion of our cloud ecosystems. An increasing global deployment and accelerated interconnection growth are helping contribute to firm yield and reduce churn. We continue to see customers expand their geographic with Platform Equinix, and today, 67% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple regions up from 63% last year and 81% of recurring revenues come from customer deployed across multiple metros, up from 79% last year.","Now let me show the highlights of our industry vertical performance this past quarter. Our network vertical delivered steady growth as wireline carriers upgrade core node infrastructure to support exponential traffic growth in new services. And several of our non-strategic customers began to bundle Equinix into their custom enterprise solutions.","Network interconnection also experienced strong growth as both connections to and from our network customers grew more than 20% year-over-year. Emerging demand for mobile platforms is generating new business and wins in this vertical include EE, the UK's largest 4G operator, and Truphone, a global mobile network operator.","Content and digital media delivered a record quarter with healthy demand from large content players and rapid growth in our advertising sub-segment, which is gaining traction as real-time ad placement becomes a cornerstone of the company's advertising strategy.","Cloud adoption is on the rise among content and digital media companies as they leverage the scaling advantages offered by cloud and seek the low latency required to deliver the highest quality user experience. For example, global publishing company HarperCollins recently chose to connect to Microsoft Azure through the Equinix Cloud Exchange inside our London IBX, in order to achieve guaranteed levels of security and latency with improved operational resilience and flexibility.","Turning to financial services, we saw steady growth and continued progress in diversifying our financial services business across insurance, retail banking, and digital payments and processing.","Our five largest financial deals of the quarter came from these sectors, including a top 15 global retail bank, a top five global insurance firm, and the third largest global payments and analytics provider. Electronic payments in particular is an area, where we have been increasingly focused and we see potential for a digital commerce ecosystem to emerge spanning multiple industries. We have captured over 50 customers in the digital commerce space, including Adyen, a global payments technology provider, leveraging Equinix's network density and cloud connectivity to enable global payments for merchants from anywhere in the world.","Turning to our cloud and enterprise verticals, the enterprise shift from centralized in-house IT infrastructure to distributed hybrid and public cloud architectures is driving an incremental and transformational opportunity that we expect to be Equinix's top growth vector over the next several years. In the fourth quarter, cloud and IT services again delivered record bookings. And we now have over 1,250 cloud and IT service companies driving 27% of our revenue.","Expansions on AWS, Oracle, Microsoft, and T-Systems drove strong momentum in the quarter and we saw an uptick in larger footprint deals as the size of deployments for public and private cloud access nodes have expanded given the rapid growth in this market. Cloud service providers continue to choose Platform Equinix to support rapid global deployment, cutting edge application performance and unmatched reliability. The Equinix Cloud Exchange, our intelligent switching platform that enables companies to connect directly and securely to multiple cloud and network providers continues to scale and is now live in 19 markets globally.","Over 100 companies, enterprises, networks and cloud service providers have joined the Equinix Cloud Exchange and new wins include Google, IBM Software, Fusion Apps as well as PacNet, Tata, and Telecom Italia. Google and IBM Software are two important platform wins that enhance the value and diversity of our cloud ecosystem. Equinix will offer high-performance direct access to Google Cloud platform in 15 markets and to the IBM Software platform in 9 markets this year.","On the enterprise side, as leading companies around the globe operate increasingly interconnected and on demand business models, we're experiencing significant momentum in the enterprise market. Over 100 customers have deployed Performance Hub, our targeted solution that allows customers to deploy IT resources closer to user population and provide secure high-bandwidth connectivity to a variety of networks in cloud.","This distributed interconnection based approach to data center computing provides significant benefits in both application and network performance. Enterprise wins include General Electric, as well as GP Strategies, a management consulting and engineering services firm, and Metso, a leading process provider for mining and oil and gas.","So let me stop here and turn the call over to Keith to provide some deeper results \u2013 deeper details on the results for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Great. Thanks, Steve. And good afternoon to everyone. To start, I'd like to first review some of our 2014 highlights, and then I'll turn to our fourth quarter performance.","We reported revenues of $2.44 billion representing an almost 14% year-over-year growth rate. All three regions delivered better than expectations, with EMEA and Asia-Pacific show reported growth of 21% and 19% respectively, while the Americas region produced greater than expected growth of 9% on its much larger base.","We continue to balance margin expectations with the reinvestment in the business to drive our future growth. Our gross profit margin was 51% and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46% after taking into consideration significant investment and expansion activities across the regions, as well as directing approximately $30 million in operating expenses to fund new product innovations, such as Cloud Exchange and Performance Hub. Also in 2014, we continued to scale our go-to-market efforts to better position ourselves to attract the enterprise customer. Despite these investments, our margins remain stable and we continue to target a longer-term objective of achieving 50% adjusted EBITDA margins or better.","We continue to focus on the balance sheet and finding ways to optimize our capital structure. During the fourth quarter, we refreshed our debt structure and secured $2.75 billion of new financings. This puts us in a great position to fund both our existing and new initiatives, invest in the development pipeline, and fund our quarterly dividend.","So, let me now turn to slide four. As I'd like to highlight how we allocated the resources in 2014. First, we generated approximately $709 million in adjusted cash from operations, and then reinvested $660 million of this cash into development and other projects that have consistently high levels of return, including our newly opened Melbourne and Singapore IBXs. We now have 103 data centers across 33 markets, the largest global retail data center footprint in the world. We purchased the remaining shares of ALOG in Brazil, and now own 100% of this important South American asset. Also we continue to increase the number of assets owned and developed with the purchase of land for our current and our future Melbourne IBXs.","And finally, we repurchased $298 million of Equinix stock in 2014 and completed $416 million special distribution for stockholders, which included $83 million in cash.","Returning to the fourth quarter, simply put, it was another outstanding quarter for the Equinix team. Our strategy continues to deliver better-than-expected results across the company. At the global level, we had record gross and net bookings, and our quarterly key metrics remain solid including MRR per cabinet especially on an FX neutral basis and net cabinets billing.","Also our interconnection metrics were again outstanding as we added 5,600 net cross-connects, and 130 exchange ports this quarter alone.","As depicted on slide five, global Q4 revenues were $638.1 million, our 48th consecutive quarter of top line revenue growth, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 13% over the same quarter last year. Our over performance was due to higher gross bookings, lower than planned MRR churn, and continued custom sales order activity.","Our Q4 revenue performance net of our FX hedges absorbs an $8.5 million negative currency impact when compared to the average rates used last quarter, and a $1 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. Currency volatility against all of our operating currencies continues to cause significant FX headwinds this quarter and meaningfully affected our 2015 guidance. Our largest exposure to FX movement related to the weakening of the Brazilian real, the British pound, and the euro.","For 2015, we have layered in new hedges approximating 80% coverage against our EMEA operating currencies for the full year. Besides the negative FX impact on our 2015 guidance, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has created a $100 million FX headwind against revenues and a $47 million headwind against our adjusted EBITDA.","Cash SG&A expenses increased to $147.8 million for the quarter, higher than guidance primarily due to a December change in our commission practices, where our sales reps will now earn their sales commissions when their order is booked versus when the order is billed. This change was made to better align our comp practices with the market and to enable us to better track these costs as we measure our business performance.","As a result, we accelerated on a one-time basis $7 million of sales commission cost into the fourth quarter. This was not included in our prior guidance. Global adjusted EBITDA was $294.4 million, at the top end of our guidance range and up 12% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46%. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $1.1 million currency impact when compared to the average rates used last quarter and a $3.4 million net positive impact when compared to the FX guidance rates.","In the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss of $355.1 million. Consistent with our comments from the last earnings call, a large portion of this loss relates to write-off of deferred tax assets totaling $324 million as we formalized our conversion to a REIT. Also we recorded a $106 million loss on debt extinguishment related to our refinancing efforts. Our Q4 operating cash flow decreased slightly over the prior quarter to $202.3 million, largely due to increased cash interest and taxes paid. Also our DSOs improved two days to 37 days.","Our AFFO for the year was $761.7 million, higher than our expectations mainly due to lower than expected recurring CapEx and cash taxes. MRR churn was better than anticipated at 1.9%, the second quarter in a row where we are below the 2% threshold and we believe reflects some level of stabilization of this key metric. For the full year 2015, we expect our MRR churn rate to range between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, although we do expect the average to be at the lower-end of this range.","Now moving on to our comments on REIT; well, we've officially began operating as a REIT as of January 1, 2015, which is a significant and exciting milestone for the company. That said, to give you a perspective on how we've structured our REIT assets, we placed the majority of our U.S. and European assets along with our Japanese assets under the qualified REIT structure or QRS, with the rest of Asia, Brazil and Canada placed in our TRS or taxable REIT structure. This is important to note as the taxable income from our QRS business is what drives our dividend payout requirements. In addition, while we don't yet have our PLR in hand, we continue to expect to receive a favorable PLR in 2015.","On slide six, we summarize our expected REIT related cash cost and taxes. We expect our second special distribution to range between $580 million and $680 million and to be paid in Q4 of 2015. Our REIT-related cash cost should approximate $12 million in 2015 including $2 million of one-time costs to finalize the REIT structure. And finally we expect our effective worldwide tax rate excluding REIT-related cash taxes to range between 10% and 15% in 2015, although this range may narrow as we continue to review our tax operating structure.","Turning to slide seven, I'd like to start reviewing the regional results beginning with the Americas. The Americas had a strong quarter, delivering its second highest gross bookings activity with record cross-connect addition. These results clearly show the benefits from our core strategy. The Americas revenues increased 4% over the prior quarter and 10% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis.","Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 5% over the prior quarter and 6% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Americas adjusted EBITDA margin was 47% for the quarter, a step-up over the prior quarter due to lower seasonal utility expenses. In 2015, we expect to spend approximately $7 million to integrate our ALOG business. Americas net cabinets billing increased by 500 in the quarter, lower than last quarter, largely due to timing of installations. We added a record 3,500 net cross-connects and 95 exchange ports in Q4, highlighting the strong demand for our Americas digital exchanges. With respect to the region's new builds, we're expanding our Dallas 2 IBX in the Infomart, which is the primary interconnection building in the Dallas market.","Now, looking at EMEA, please turn to slide eight. EMEA delivered a strong quarter with record gross bookings with particular strength coming from our Dutch and German businesses. Revenues were up 6% quarter-over-quarter \u2013 pardon me, and 17% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis.","Our EMEA business continues to capture market share, growing twice as fast as our regional competitors. Also, we would like to highlight the improved German performance throughout the year, the result of new leadership, better execution, and renewed focus across our German team.","Adjusted EBITDA on a normalized and constant currency basis was up 1% over the prior quarter and up 18% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased slightly to 42% due to one-off cost in the fourth quarter. EMEA interconnection revenues increased 2% over the prior quarter and up 29% over the same quarter last year and represents 9% of the region's recurring revenues.","We added 1,200 net cross-connects in the quarter and EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant currency basis. Net cabinets billing increased by approximately 600.","Moving to expansion opportunities, the Frankfurt market has performed very well in 2014 and we've seen a substantial increase in our fill rate compared to the prior year. To support this demand, we're expanding both our Frankfurt II and our Frankfurt IV IBXs.","We're also accelerating the third phase of our Amsterdam-3 asset to respond to sales momentum in the Dutch business. Located on the Amsterdam Science Park, this is the second most cloud dense location in Europe and an important interconnection hub for our customers.","And now looking at Asia Pacific, please refer to slide nine. Asia Pacific revenues were up 7% over the prior quarter and 29% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis driven by record gross bookings in the cloud and IT services and network segment. Adjusted EBITDA on normalized and constant currency basis was up 9% over the last quarter and 34% over the same quarter last year.","MRR per cabinet on a constant currency basis went up 3% quarter-over-quarter largely due to increased power density and a steady increase in interconnection revenues. Also, cabinets billing increased by 700 over the prior quarter. We added 900 net cross-connects and interconnection revenues remain at 12% of the region's recurring revenues.","In December, we opened our first data center in Melbourne, Australia expanding Platform Equinix to 33 markets. The Melbourne business already logged more than 40 new customers including our 11 network service providers.","We're also expanding into Hong Kong market with new phases in both Hong Kong I and Hong Kong II IBXs to support deployments from the digital, media and financial verticals.","And now looking at our balance sheet, please refer to slide 10. Fourth quarter was very active from a capital structure perspective. We settled our 2014 converts, we completed two new debt deals securing $2.75 billion in fundings.","We used the proceeds from these offerings to redeem our 7% senior notes, did all the make whole payment and repay our prior term loan. These transactions effectively lowered the average cost of our debt financings to 4.93%.","We ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion of cash and the net debt leverage ratio decreased slightly to three times our Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA.","Now switching to AFFO and our dividend outlook for \u2013 on slide 11. For 2015, we expect the AFFO to be greater than $810 million or growing 12% on a constant currency basis. This guidance absorbs $43 million in negative FX headwinds, as well as an incremental $27 million in interest expense related to our November financing.","Also today, we're excited to announce our first quarterly dividend of $1.69 per share, a very important milestone for Equinix. We expect to pay out 100% of our QRS's taxable income. Our current AFFO payout ratio approximates 48%, the result of significant international assets still structured under our TRS as well as significant tax depreciation and stock based compensation expenses.","For 2015 and beyond, we'll continue to review our QRS, TRS REIT structure. It's important to note that our goal is to maximize total shareholder return. This is facilitated by our flexibility to support a growing cash dividend, as we continue to scale our business and more of our assets move into the QRS structure, while continuing to invest in our development activities.","Turning to slide 12, given the cash on the balance sheet add to that our growing cash flows plus our debt capacity we are well positioned to fund our 2015 development activities, pay our quarterly dividends including the 2015 special distribution and service our debt obligations. As a REIT, our target net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio will remain at 3 times to 4 times. This level of debt provides us the strategic and operational flexibility, we need to execute against our business needs.","Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to slide 13. For the quarter, cap expenditures were $238.5 million including recurring CapEx of $33 million in line with our guidance. We currently have 16 announced expansion projects underway across the globe of which 15 are campus builds or incremental phase build. Also note we have finalized the breakout of CapEx between recurring and non-recurring for our AFFO definition. This is the format we'll be reporting on, on a go forward basis.","Turning to slide 14, the operating performance of our stabilized 69 global IBX and expansion projects that have been open for more than one year continue to perform well with revenues up 6% on a year-over-year basis. Currently, these projects generate a 32% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested and are 82% utilized.","And lastly one final point, as part of the REIT conversion, we'll continue to rollout incremental financial data to enable our investors to sit back and analyze the business. This quarter, we added a supplemental section to our earnings deck, which now includes our non-financial metrics and expansion sheet, as well as some additional disclosure.","Starting in Q1, we expect to add additional materials to this earnings deck, including the components of NAV and NOI. So let me stop there and turn it back to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Keith, thanks. Let me now cover our 2015 strategy and outlook on slide 15. Our focus in 2015 is driven by three strategic priorities, designed to further differentiate our global data center services and extend Platform Equinix.","First, we will continue to drive differentiated growth by deepening our existing ecosystems and applying particular focus on capturing the expanded opportunity in cloud and enterprise. With both network and power density that is unparalleled, we aim to become the provider of choice for the new age of enterprise IT. We will continue to invest meaningfully in innovation to deliver enhanced offers for multi-cloud consumption and build-out our cloud service provider ecosystems, anchored by cloud technology leaders.","Second, to tackle these opportunities effectively, we will also invest in our go-to-market and our global platform to broaden our reach, scale, scale our organization and deliver premium customer services. We will do this by expanding our channel program to enhance our reach into the enterprise through agents, resellers, systems integrators, and key platform partners such as Microsoft, NetApp, and Cisco, working in tandem with our direct sales engine. Additionally, we're delivering on our commitment to build a professional services practice that aids enterprises in designing and deploying next-generation architectures, starting with our acquisition of Nimbo, an established market leader in enabling hybrid cloud.","In parallel, we're expanding our sales support and enablement functions including our solution architects and sales engineers that facilitate the selling process. To support these efforts and the growth of our sales engine, we're driving global consistency and alignment through our Equinix Customer One program. This initiative is enhancing our customers' experience through global standardization of our products and streamlining our quote to cash process. We successfully rolled this out in Asia in the fourth quarter and will implement the EMEA and Americas regions by mid-2015. And finally, we will continue to refine our capital allocation strategy of profitable growth through organic and inorganic investments and the distribution of dividends, while driving return on invested capital. We continue to ensure that our expansion CapEx supports our growth objectives and optimizes capital outlays, while balancing project risk and customer needs.","Equinix has a long history of achieving attractive returns in the development of new properties. This is done by building campuses that can be extended with additional premium priced space connected to our mature datacenters where interconnected communities of customers have already been established. The vast majority of our new development is in existing markets and our unique market intelligence gained from working with customers, gives us visibility into a market's demand, pricing and returns. This knowledge helps us make prudent capital allocation decisions and enables us to maintain highly differentiated project returns.","Last I'll cover our outlook for 2015 on slide 16 to slide 19. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of $634 million to $638 million, which absorbs $19 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to Q4, 2014 average FX rates and normalized and constant currency growth of 3% quarter-over-quarter. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $146 million to $150 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $287 million and $291 million, which includes $12 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to Q4 2014 average FX rates and normalizing constant currency growth of 3% quarter-over-quarter.","Capital expenditures are expected to be $195 million to $205 million, which includes approximately $25 million of recurring capital expenditures.","For the full year of 2015, we expect revenues to be greater than $2.63 billion, which absorbs $100 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to 2014 average FX rate, reflecting a normalized and constant currency growth of 12%.","Full year cash gross margins are expected to range between 68% and 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $580 million to $600 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be greater than $1.22 billion or a 46% EBITDA margin, an 80 basis point improvement over the last year. This guidance absorbs $47 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to 2014 average FX rates. We expect adjusted funds from operations to be greater than $810 million, a 12% constant currency growth year-over-year.","And finally, we expect capital expenditures to range between $700 million and $800 million, which includes $115 million of recurring capital expenditures. For 2015, we expect 95% of this expansion capital expenditure will be for campus and existing market build, and roughly 5% for new market development.","So in closing, we are leveraging our leadership position to build unique customer offers and enhance our ecosystems while scaling the business globally. We're successfully expanding our ecosystem of cloud services, which coupled with our network density will drive growth across our entire platform. The rapid growth of interconnection reflects the importance of Equinix as the place where leading companies come to connect their customers and partners to accelerate the growth of their business. I'm very pleased with our position going into this year and look forward to continued progress against our objectives.","So let me stop here and open it up for questions. Liz, I'll turn it back over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now open for questions. Our first question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. Your line is open.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, if I could just three quick ones, first, Keith, could you talk about the difference in the rate of I guess taxable income or AFFO growth whichever one you think is more relevant for the QRS and the TRS, so that we can understand what the growth possibilities for the dividend are as they're propelled by the results of the QRS itself.","I guess the second question is for you, Steve, which would be could you kind of elaborate on your appetite for a large scale consolidating European transaction and if so give us details on that? And then the third question I guess is the obvious one which is \u2013 a year ago we heard that the PLR was coming in 2014, now we're hearing in 2015 \u2013 that it's coming in 2015. The question I get 10 times more often than any other fundamental question is, what possible reason could there be that you don't have it already, you've paid a lot of people a lot of money to help you in this process, they must be telling you something, could you please tell us what it is? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Okay, well, I will start first and foremost with the \u2013 sort of the AFFO and really talk a little bit about the REIT structure, and just having it from the \u2013 in the prepared remarks, and you think about the QRS, it has majority, it has the American business, which is as you know, as I reported, our slowest growing business albeit on a very large base. So, our European business on a currency adjusted basis is our second fastest-growing and then the Japanese business those are all sitting in the queue. What's not sitting in the queue is the rest of our Asian business, and no surprise to you that is Hong Kong, that's Australia, that's Singapore.","And so, when you look at \u2013 sorry, and there is Canada and Brazil. Brazil, because it's a managed services business, you can appreciate it. It doesn't have the revenue type that's fully suitable for REIT, and so think of Brazil as staying inside the T on a continuous basis.","For the remaining assets, you can get a good sense, if you think about Singapore, you think about Australia, you think about us opening up our Toronto 2 asset in Canada. You're going to have a lot of growth still coming from inside the T. And, over time, the reason that we \u2013 the reason that we're structured today as is we're trying to do it tax efficiently, but we also have to meet the REIT compliance test in 2015 with it being a conversion year, we have to be very thoughtful about what assets you move in over what period of time.","All that is to say, when you look at the Q, or you look at the T, these both have very good growth potential. And, over time, not only growth in the overall business, but certainly as we move assets from the T into the Q that will give you the opportunity to get growth on the dividend.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, let me take the second one, David. I guess I'd start with reminding the audience on the phone that our priorities for inorganic growth really around three areas. One, scaling our platform globally, very similar to what we did in Brazil and Dubai for example, entering those new markets over the last 18 months to 24 months. That's still of high interest to growing our platform globally.","I guess the second component might be our continued focus on enhancing our interconnection and growing that platform very similar to what we did in Germany with the ancotel acquisition. So I would tell you that we look for those kinds of plays constantly.","And then, third, certainly, grown over the last couple years is capturing the cloud ecosystem and enhancing the enterprise capabilities to connect to the cloud ecosystem and the acquisition of Nimbo is professional services capability that's aimed at enterprise hybrid cloud enablement is a step in that direction to accelerate our ability to prosecute the cloud business.","So, we look at a lot of things as you well know, the new markets include big, big regions like South Korea and India, and going deeper into China and going deeper into Latin America. So, we're looking at lots of regions of the world, South Africa is of interest to us. So, we've been pretty consistent on the places that scaling the platform are of interest to us. Europe is still obviously a very interesting marketplace for us. I wouldn't want to comment specifically on anything that we're all reading about here recently.","With respect to our European business, we're very pleased with where we are with that business, and as Keith mentioned, it grew 21% year-on-year. It's growing substantially faster because of the inbound bookings we pushed into that region from the other two regions, interconnection growth grew 30% year-on-year. So, it's doing very, very well. Our focus here is to continue to grow that business as it is today and we'll continue to compete with the regional players in all parts of the world. We think we've done that very successfully. Our mantra is to continue on this global platform focus. So, I don't know if anybody would add anything there, Charles or Keith, on the European question?","On the PLR, top of everybody's mind, I think given our position on our first quarterly dividend, David, I guess all I can tell you is that we're still highly confident that we're going to get a response here in 2015 and that's based on the existing legal precedence that's out there today, the fact that many other data center companies are currently operating as REITs. So, we believe, we qualify for taxation as a REIT.","Unfortunately, it's out of our hands right now. The ball is in the IRS's court. We've provided them everything that they need, and you have to remember here also that the previous couple of players that went through this process, I think, Iron Mountain and Lamar, and I forget a couple others, actually all received their \u2013 a couple of those guys received their PLRs post conversion. So, these conditions that we're living in today are not terribly unusual. I think everybody is frustrated about it but we still remain highly confident that we'll get a positive response here in 2015.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, guys. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore. Your line is open.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, I'd like to ask a question about the investment into the professional services organization, maybe two elements to that. One, could you give us an example of the advice, the problem solution that you're providing to your customers through that organization? And then secondly as we think about that business becoming more important to Equinix over time, are there any margin implications that we should be considering? Thanks.","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Hey, Jonathan, it's Charles. I'll take that one. I think that \u2013 a couple things. Again, what we're seeing is our investment in pro serv is really a response to what we're seeing from our enterprise customers in terms of what they need to implement hybrid cloud effectively. And what we're finding is, is that they're at a stage where they are still examining how hybrid cloud fits, how they can implement it, which workloads they would want to consider moving into a hybrid cloud environment, which ones they may want to keep in a more traditional colocation setting, what workloads lend themselves well to a public cloud, interconnect, and then how to implement that over time, particularly in a highly distributed fashion globally for larger players.","So that's the type of advice that they are looking for before they make commitments and execute plans on hybrid cloud implementation. And Nimbo was already actively engaged with customers of ours and with partners of ours like Microsoft in those types of discussions. And so we're very excited about the opportunity and in fact have gotten a ton of positive feedback from partners like Microsoft and existing customers about that capability. And so that's the essence of what they're doing and again it's early days. But we continue to be really optimistic about what that means for us and for our customers, as they look to implement hybrid cloud.","In terms of our desire, I would say that the overall scale of the business is a couple things. We are \u2013 our objective here is not to grow a professional services firm for the purpose of growing our top-line, it is really to draw pull through and demand for Platform Equinix over time as a hybrid cloud enablement platform. And so we are going to do that kind of business and we'll do it at reasonable margins. They will certainly be lower than our services business, but the overall scale of the business will be relatively immaterial and not have a significant impact on the overall margin structure.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)","All right. Thank you for taking the questions.","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is open.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. First question I had was, if you could just share with us what the sequential currency headwind was in the fourth quarter from the average rate in the third quarter?","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, the \u2013 so on a total basis, Michael, it's \u2013 the net exposure is $8.5 million on the top-line. Having said that, the currency hedges themselves offset a fairly meaty piece of that exposure, but overall, it's a net hit of $8.5 million.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And, just secondly when you look at the flow through to revenue in the quarter, on a sequential base if you add back some currencies above the average of the last few quarters, would you say that this is a result of the stronger bookings and sales activity or is it some of the book-to-bill that you highlighted in the past catching up?","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Michael, really it's a combination of all three things. I'd tell you, it's not only the fact that we're pushing more volume into the system, and as Steve alluded to, we had record gross and net bookings this quarter, effectively Americas second best quarter ever, and the other two regions, their best ever. If you combine that with churn being lower than our expectation, that's a great output to our revenue line, number one. And number two, the book-to-bill interval, so certainly there're some of that that bleeds into the results. And then the last piece, which is something that we've spent a little bit more energy on this year, relative to last year. We actually do more nonrecurring activities as well. I would tell you, as we look in this quarter, it's roughly just over \u2013 NRR is roughly 5% of our revenues, but relative to where we'd come from we do a little bit more, and so for those three reasons alone you see a nice step up in our activity.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And one last question if I could. You're carrying a balance of cash, I think, you referenced it a little over $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","If you take the average interest rate, multiply that against the $1.1 billion, if I'm calculating this correctly, it's almost $1 per share of pre-tax interest. How should we think about what kind of cash balance you're going to carry going forward and how to think about the cost of that cash balance? Thanks.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. It's a very good question. I think look, certainly, we went to the markets opportunistically at the end of November, or sorry in November. And we did that for a couple reasons. One, we felt it was a good time to go and refinance, we wanted to take out our 7% senior notes, we wanted to put a new term line in place. We also wanted to have a revolving line of credit. And that $1.5 billion facility between the term-loan and the line of credit is very, very cheap money for us, it's up 2%.","If you think about the high yield that we did on a blended basis between 7% and 10%, it's a 5.52% cost of capital. All of that to say, as I said in my comments, our cost of funds today on a blended basis for all of our financings is 4.93%. So that's the first thing.","The second thing I want to leave you with is the $1.1 million, as I said, we opportunistically went to market in November. It is not our expectation that we're going to carry that level of cash on a go-forward basis. And, suffice it to say when you think about the capital investment that we're going to be making this year and you add to that basically the dividends that we're going to be disbursing, plus perhaps some asset acquisitions, some land or some buildings, all of a sudden you can get a pretty good sense of what we're going to consume a fairly meaty piece of that $1.1 billion.","And, therefore, as you roll forward in time beyond 2015, I would expect that you would see us either continue to consume cash from the balance sheet, as we generate it, but also go into our revolving line of credit. And then, as times permit we go back to the market and raise more debt to fund the future growth. And so, that's how we're sort of seeing it. I would tell you I don't think that you're going to see a lot of cash left on our balance sheet on a regular basis given the fact that we've now converted to a REIT.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen and Company","Great. Thank you. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're seeing an uptick in larger footprint deals and I wanted to know how are you able to potentially dynamically adjust your own offer or investment in your facilities to continue to get what you would deem the proper return. And then the second question is, I noticed in your AFFO calculation, you changed how you account for installation of revenue adjustment, and I was wondering why you may have done that and is the AFFO formula you have out there now something we should consider to be the finalized version. And then just one point of clarification, you mentioned for example in the first quarter that you're observing $19 million in FX headwinds. How much of that is actually being covered by the hedge itself?","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks. Hey, Colby, this is Charles. I will take the first piece around large footprint, and then let Keith handle the other ones. As we've said consistently over the years our ecosystem centric strategy is very focused on putting the right customers with the right applications into the right assets and that really continues to be the case. But undoubtedly as we did comment in the script we're seeing an uptick in the requirements around the large footprint, particularly for cloud service providers who are looking to rapidly scale their business on a global basis. And that's \u2013 again we been \u2013 we've sort of always had that posture of, hey, there are large footprint deals that we believe are accretive to the overall ecosystem story that we will pursue and that we believe can sort of because of their ecosystem power, sort of support the right kind of long-term blended returns.","And we are seeing those and winning that type of business and in terms of how we accommodate it, I think that and I would say in Asia and Europe we have typically sort of managed our facilities as some are blended facilities anyway with a combination of sort of small, medium, and large footprint deals going into those facilities. In U.S. it has been a little different. In that, there are specific assets where we are in a better position to accommodate large footprint at the right kind of price points with the right dynamics for customers.","And we continue to have that capacity available to us and so we're looking at selectively putting those into \u2013 in the markets around the world and we are also looking to expand our capabilities and looking at our investment portfolio and plan to continue to put the right kind of capacity in the right places and looking at evolving the offer so that we can deploy essentially hybrid infrastructures that allow us to ebb and flow with the market demand and put the right mix of larger footprint and traditional premium retail into a market at once, and doing that in a way that we also are looking to sort of phase the capital more aggressively by really doing it as just in time as possible and that's another thing that our global designing and construction teams are actively looking at. So, those are the things that are going on right now, in terms of us being able to respond to that. We do see plenty of opportunity and we're going to be selective about that, because not every deal is something that we're going to chase. But the ones that we think are critical to winning in the cloud are things that we will pursue.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","So, Colby, then on the other two questions, as it relates to AFFO, what I would say first and foremost is, I think we are \u2013 we are now firm on what our calculation is going to be on a go-forward basis. We feel good about \u2013 I mean, the biggest area that we're really focusing in was CapEx and making sure we got the recurring CapEx, consistent with how we think we should be measuring this metric. So we've proven that up, and I'll tell you that AFFO on a principle basis is firm. And so we'll continue review it, but I feel very, very comfortable with our current definition.","As you can see by all the disclosures we have, we've done a very good reconciliation of what we include between the FFO and the AFFO, and we reconciled also from EBITDA to AFFO. So that's, that's what we feel comfortable with. And we'll tell you that the $810 million increase, the $810 million as I said currency is impacting that number by $43 million, interest based on the November financing, again that was an opportunistic financing, relative to our expectation that adds another $27 million. If we hadn't done that our number would have been looked more likely $880 million on a constant currency basis or roughly 16% up quarter-over-quarter.","And then \u2013 going then back to the comment just on currencies. If we look at currencies, again we did some bridges in our presentation, and so, when you go to pages 16 and 17, you get a pretty good sense of how currency has impacted it. Suffice it to say, I don't have the exact number, but what we gave was in the press release, we told you the rates of exchange that we're using for our currencies. And embedded in that of course, if you take euro, for example, it's trading spot today is roughly $113 and we've got a blended rate of $120. And it's no different than what we experienced last quarter where basically spot was roughly $126 and we're guiding you at $132. And all that to say is that we are looking at our relatively big currency impact on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And so, as we sort of presented in our reconciliation, in our bridges, you will see absent \u2013 taking out currency, we're reporting revenues flat quarter-over-quarter, currency is having a 3 percentage \u2013 3 growth point \u2013 I'm sorry, 3 points of growth impact on our Q1 results. And so we've now got \u2013 we've got this \u2013 the guidance range, we have got the \u2013 what we think is the size of the impact, and that should give you a good step forward in how to look at the business.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen and Company","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. So, I wanted to go back to the European situation and I just wondered how that M&A deal that's been proposed would affect you from a competitive standpoint given that it would create a clear new leader in the colo sector over there. And then just turning to your comments where you ended up Microsoft to NetApp, and I just wanted to get a sense about indirect channel and if you could quantify the contribution of the indirect channel today and then how large do you see that growing over time? And then finally just on the churn, it's been the lowest it's been for a while, and I wondered if that's sort of a sustainable level or how we should think about churn? Thank you.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right, Jon. Why don't I start, this is Steve, and then Keith or Charles you guys might want to give your opinion here on the European thing. I think I've stated \u2013 I tried to be clear in the first question that was asked about this, about where our priorities are for inorganic growth. And that's where the focus is. So, the combination that you're referring to over there, we're obviously have watched it, will watch it, are \u2013 those kinds of styles of companies have been on our gameboard for ever. Our interest is again back to what I said earlier which is to scale this platform globally to bolt more things on like Brazil and Dubai. We feel like the business that we're doing in Europe which is growing faster than both of those assets is doing exactly what we wanted it to do.","If you'll remember when we went into Europe 2008, the IX Europe asset was the third largest player. I think, at the time Telecity if I remember correctly was number one, Interxion was number two.","Five years later now with the global platform wrapped around our EMEA business, this business is growing two times as fast as our competitors. So, it's doing exactly what we wanted it to do and that's where our priority and focus is going to remain. And we'll compete with regional providers all over the world, I think, it will be no different as we look at this potential combined competitor.","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I guess, all I'd add Jonathan is that again we really operate primarily and compete primarily as a global platform. And so, in our view the combination wouldn't meaningfully change the competitive dynamic there, the assets that are in play in terms of how they meet the customers' needs are essentially the same in a post-combination world.","And again most of the customers who really resonate with the Equinix value proposition are often looking for a global player. As we've talked about, and I think, highlighted here in the metrics in our business, a substantial portion of our revenue is from customers who are operating with us in a multi-region way. And so, we're going to continue to sell into those opportunities and we think we can compete very effectively with those companies either independently or in combination.","And then as it relates to the platform players we're very excited about the momentum we're seeing in terms of platform players and the reach that they have into the market particularly from a cloud perspective as customers look at the hybrid cloud implementation and so that's one of the significant investments, we're making is putting channel partners and channel program investments sort of into the system on a global basis and we are seeing levels of engagement between ourselves and the sales teams of key partners like a NetApp, like a Microsoft, et cetera, as being a very meaningful way that we're going to gain access to the enterprise market. And then when you look at that \u2013 I mean, as we talked about at Analyst Day, it's a huge addressable market, several hundred thousand possible target customers for the services that we deliver and we're simply not going to reach those with our direct quota bearing head count and so it's critical that we invest in the programs and the channel sales resources to partner up with those types of players.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","And then the third question, Jonathan, the...","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Churn.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","It was churn, and so 1.9% that's the second quarter in a row where we've been below that threshold of 2%. Clearly, we love to be at this level on a continuous basis, but we think it's appropriate to say, we think it stabilized, this is an important metric that has stabilized, number one. Then number two we're guiding on a forward basis 2% to 2.5% recognizing, we think the average is going to be at the lower end of the range, as I said. But the other part is, the reason we give range is, as you can appreciate churn, it has variability to it, and we wanted to make sure that we share that with the investors and on the call here. So for all those reasons, I think, we feel very comfortable that we're seeing stabilization and as we sort of look forward, we feel good with our guidance there.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I guess, the only thing I would add is...","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","\u2013 what we always talked about is that the best protection, the best way to manage churn over time is to get the right business in the door to begin with, and I think we've been very disciplined about that and I think we're seeing the benefits of that. And there is some volatility in it, but we continue to see things very positively from the churn perspective.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess just a quick follow-up on the churn side. Taking a longer term, Keith and Charles, given the wake of optimization, is there a way that we can sort of wind this thing or trend it lower or is just there a natural resistance that you guys bump up against. And then secondly, not to keep plugging away on inorganic things, but it sounds like domestically AT&T is interested in probably getting out of some of the data centers. Just trying to get a sense for what you guys think about that asset or the carrier assets that will be a good fit structurally, any thoughts around that would be great?","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Mike. I'll jump in and start on the first one. I don't know that we know exactly what the natural sort of frictional churn in our business would be, and I think, we're constantly \u2013 we're obviously very focused on continuing to reduce churn and make sure that there are no regrettable churn losses in our business. And candidly, there are very few today. For the most part, what we see is frictional churn associated with people optimizing platforms and footprints over time and resolved to a changing dynamic in their business. And so, I don't know that we could answer whether \u2013 certainly I think that we have the opportunity to continue to reduce it over time, but I think that the range that we've given you and kind of where within that range we expect to operate is our best current view.","Over time, particularly as we scale the enterprise opportunity and if we're winning the kind of business that we expect to win around Performance Hub implementations, attached to Cloud Exchange as part of an overall hybrid cloud implementation, we believe that will be very sticky business, like much of the rest of what we offer today. And so, yes we would strive to be driving that lower. That increases customer lifetime value and creates long-term intrinsic value for the business. So we're going to \u2013 we would strive for that, but I think that the range that we've given is probably where we would be comfortable with providing right now until we learn more.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Charles, I'm sorry. Is there a significant difference in the enterprise base with respect to MRR growth or MRR churn?","Charles J. Meyers - Chief Operating Officer","Well, I mean, I think that we are \u2013 right now we are seeing our logo \u2013 new logo wins are actually very focused on the enterprise, the bulk of our new logo wins are in the enterprise space. It was I believe our fastest growing bookings segment in the enterprise and so we are probably seeing that segment over index. It's probably easier for it to over index, as it's a bit smaller than the others, but that is certainly a sign of momentum. And then churn wise I would say to be determined, right, because these new implementations, these new enterprise implementations particularly Performance Hub is a new offering for us. Again, we believe based on what we're seeing because of how it leverages our network density and how it leverages our cloud density, we think they're going to be very sticky over time. And again the interconnection momentum we're seeing sort of indicates that. So that would be my comment on that.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think on your second question Mike, on the AT&T assets, yes, from time-to-time we look at opportunities like this, very frequently and very quickly we fall back to our priorities. It unlikely puts us into a new market where customers want us to go to extend the platform, if it's an interconnected asset, it might be of interest to us, if it's going to extend the cloud ecosystem, or allow us to prosecute enterprises better in some market would be interesting to us. But typically when you're looking at those older assets you're not really buying forward, you're more buying backwards and so not very often do we find an asset from those types of companies. But there are examples and you would know of them. There's examples in some of those companies that \u2013 particular assets that would be of interest to us.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","If they were to deemphasize that business, would it have any meaningful impact on industry dynamics, industry pricing here?","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You mean, being in the co-lo part of their business?","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","If they start to get out of it, or they sell to somebody else, will that have an overall impact on the pricing environment?","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think so, I mean, as you guys, you know we compete with a lot of carriers on that part of their business where they have co-lo assets in certain markets and I think if that share shifted somewhere, it wouldn't be a big impact on us.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our final question comes from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Your line is open.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. Obviously we've spoken a bit about the foreign currency here and impact. And I was wondering if we could take it just from a different dynamic, I mean, as you look to build out the global platform, perhaps not even just from an inorganic perspective, but is there an opportunity here to leverage some of the near-term disruption in currency to accelerate some of the investments for building out certain assets in areas where your customer pull has really been driving you? And then a follow-up on that is from a capacity perspective, obviously we saw a couple of quarters ago, there was some rattling in the marketplace in terms of pricing and some builds on capacity. I would love to get an update in terms of where you're seeing sort of pricing trends right now and the capacity that you're seeing in the marketplace? Thank you very much.","Stephen M. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, why don't I take the first one, and I want to also supplement it with a comment just on margins as well. I think like anything, when the currencies, when our functional currency, which is USD, is strong, clearly it gives you an opportunity to look at initiatives. And from our perspective, because we're already investing quite handsomely across our portfolio and across the regions, I would tell you, it's not going to make us do anything radically different, but like anything when you look at it and you look at the decisions on when to put capital to work in a given market, clearly it can work to your advantage. And so whether it's a U.S. \u2013 sorry, whether it's the Canadian dollar or the Australian dollar, or for that matter the Singaporean dollar, to the extent that we can use it to our advantage, we certainly will.","I think what's most important though is, if I step back though and just talk overall about our margins, which is something I really wanted to get out, because there has been a number of questions that we've received on that. When I take, when I look at 2015, and then we look forward and the impact that currency has had on our margins, I want to sort of just walk you all through something. First and foremost with the guidance that we have delivered, we said for the year we can do greater than $1.22 billion on EBITDA line. If I take you to 2014, we did $1.114 billion, but included in that number of course are the REIT costs. And the REIT cost, recognizing most of those are going to go away, I add $17 million, say \u2013 we spent $29 million in 2014, we're only going to spend $12 million in 2015.Therefore, on an adjusted basis, our margin is 46.3%.","So what we've said is, just on the guidance that we've delivered, we said we can do greater than $1.22 billion, that's 46.4% margin. As we look forward, we've announced two things that we're going to do, and Charles has talked to one, which is investing in the channel which is $20 million and integrating ALOG which is $7 million. If I add those two things back that's 47.4% margin. But the other thing, currency, because we're a U.S. dollar denominated company, a lot of our costs reside in U.S. dollars. The impact of the currency affecting our revenues and our EBITDA, it's affecting our margin by another 90 basis points. So, all that to say is when I reconcile out 2015 relative to 2014, we see basically a 48.3% margin business with some discreet investments that we're making in channel and the one-off investment in ALOG. That relative to what we exited 2014, which is really an adjusted 46.3%. So, overall we feel that the business is performing well, currency, yes is working against a little bit today, but given our ability to reallocate our resources and invest in the right things for our future growth, we think it's the right investment decisions to make.","Keith D. Taylor - Chief Financial Officer","And then, I'll wrap up with a commentary on sort of overall pricing environment, supply\/demand characteristics in the market. We tend to look at pricing in sort of two primary ways, really the most important being yield and our MRR per cab metrics. As you can see in our regional results, we saw strength across all three regions on a constant currency basis in our MRR per cab. So we continue to really benefit from how we're managing the business both in terms of entry price points on deals as well as \u2013 which is really driven by deal discipline, as well as some interconnection and then managing power densities effectively. And so those levers really have given us strong performance on a yield basis.","The other dimension of pricing is really as I said entry level price points on deals and obviously the sort of supply demand characteristics in the market influence that heavily. And I guess what I would say is one, where we are \u2013 we've been very \u2013 continue to be very disciplined about the deals we are pursuing and pursuing those where we have a unique and differentiated value proposition and so continue to see firm pricing there. And even where there are \u2013 where we would want to selectively pursue, say larger footprint deals or deals where the competitive overlap with other players maybe higher. What we are seeing is, I would say a favorable balance in overall supply demand across many of our markets and a general stabilization in the pricing environment.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much for the incremental color.","Stephen M.

Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen M. Smith","Okay. Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. In Q3, we delivered both revenue and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance ranges despite significant currency headwinds as the global demand for Platform Equinix continues to drive our business.","As depicted on Slide 3, revenues were $620.4 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 14% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $283.9 million for the quarter, up 3% over the prior quarter and up 14% year-over-year. We delivered near-record bookings fueled by solid performance in our core verticals, global expansion with key customers and accelerated momentum in the development of our cloud ecosystem. The strength of our ecosystem strategy continues to manifest itself in very healthy fundamentals, including firm MRR per cabinet, lower churn, rapid interconnection growth and healthy operating margins.","Interconnection continues to be a critical differentiator and source of sustaining value for Equinix. Interconnection revenue outpaced overall revenue, growing 17% year-over-year. And the robust growth of both our established and emerging ecosystems generated a record 5,700 cross-connect adds, 36% higher than our previous record. Importantly, secure private access between cloud consumers and cloud service providers is now the fastest-growing category of interconnection at Equinix.","Secular trends driving this cross-connect growth are also driving similar momentum in our leading digital exchanges. This quarter, we added 143 ports, 3x the net adds we saw on the same period last year. Strong port growth on our Internet exchanges has translated into 27% year-over-year growth in traffic to 2.8 terabits across 2,500 ports, with network content and cloud customers driving this increase.","Our global platform also remains a unique differentiator and is a key driver of our bookings momentum and revenue growth. Today, 67% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple regions, up from 60% last year. And 81% of recurring revenues come from customers deployed across multiple metros, up from 78% last year.","Global growth, robust interconnection and high levels of customer retention are a reflection of the disciplined execution of our ecosystem-centric strategy. From our early days, Equinix has demonstrated the ability to incubate, scale and extend digital ecosystems and continued success with this approach is driving solid performance across our industry verticals.","But let me share some highlights from our vertical performance, with a particular focus on our progress in capturing the transformational cloud opportunity. Beginning with network, this ecosystem continues to be foundational to our competitive advantage and delivered steady growth in Q3 as wireline carriers actively upgrade infrastructure to deploy 100-gig services and develop their own cloud offerings.","On the wireless side, as 4G networks begin to scale, mobile operators are now deploying inside Equinix in order to capture new sources of value and drive a superior customer experience in an increasingly complex mobile value chain. Mobile operators like Vodafone and China Mobile continue to expand with Equinix on our advanced peering hubs to access the wireline infrastructure and efficiently interconnect with large content players.","In content and digital media, the advertising subsegment, anchored by the exchange ecosystem we refer to as Ad-IX, grew 26% year-over-year, driven by global expansions of ad exchanges, advertising networks and data aggregators such as BrightRoll, MediaMath and RadiumOne that utilize Platform Equinix to maximize revenue in the latency-sensitive world of digital ad placement. Our advertising segment is now approximately equal in size to our CDN segment and is driving healthy levels of interconnection.","In the financial services vertical, we saw a healthy step-up in bookings over last quarter, driven by diversity of wins across exchanges, payments and insurance. Our win with BATS, who is consolidating the infrastructure on our Secaucus campus, is generating pull-through as additional clients migrate from competitive facilities in preparation for consolidation of the BATS matching engines inside of Equinix slated to go live in early 2015.","We are also seeing growing traction in the electronic payments and mobile wallet space. Similar to what happened in the development of our electronic trading ecosystem, the business of moving money is facing pressure to process more and more transactions at a lower cost, and business models are beginning to monetize payment-related data. A new ecosystem is quickly taking shape as we bring together financial institutions, technology providers, mobile networks and retail companies pursuing these opportunities.","Equinix is a trusted provider of top global payment card networks such as MasterCard, who recently expanded into Dubai with us. We are also building success with emerging technology players in this space such as iZettle, a mobile point-of-sale business, which is using the AWS Direct Connect offering.","We are also leveraging our capital markets customer base to cultivate wins in the broader financial services enterprise business. Performance Hub is a core element of IT architectures in the financial enterprise as these companies seek to enhance interconnection and service delivery to support new business models. This quarter, we won a global Performance Hub deployment from one of the largest banking institutions in the world to support its online banking business.","Our ability to nurture, grow and extend our more mature network financial services and content and digital media ecosystems continues to generate solid growth and drive superior returns on capital and remains a central focus. But the emergence of the cloud ecosystem represents a transformational opportunity and is our top growth vector as we move towards 2015.","Cloud represents a fundamental disruption in how IT services are both delivered and consumed. And building a cloud equivalent of our network density advantage is critical to our ecosystem strategy. Equinix is shaping our customers' targeting, investment profile and go-to-market model to ensure that we can meet the needs of both cloud service providers and the broad range of enterprise customers who are rapidly adopting hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. Our Cloud Exchange and the Performance Hub are key innovative offers to facilitate this new marketplace between service providers and enterprises.","On the service provider side, we are actively engaged with hundreds of cloud service providers. And we are pleased with our significant progress in building out cloud provider density. We are helping these customers efficiently scale to reach their enterprise customers through integration with our Cloud Exchange, allowing for secure, private, scalable delivery of cloud services.","We are the only exchange to offer an API capability that automates this provisioning for customers, which helps accelerate the onboarding process. And our product road map for the Cloud Exchange is designed to help cloud providers more easily adopt this interconnection model. These efforts have resulted in very strong cloud and IT service bookings and an uptick in larger footprint deal activity, driven by strong momentum with critical cloud magnets such as AWS, IBM's SoftLayer, Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle and Workday.","We continue to grow our connectivity to a broad menu of cloud service providers and now offer private access to over 70 such providers through both fiber cross connects and the Equinix Cloud Exchange. The Cloud Exchange is enabling a new private multi-vendor cloud consumption model, and new customers announcing their commitment to participate in the Cloud Exchange include Cisco, Datapipe, Blue Box and CloudSigma.","We also recently announced a unique strategic relationship with Cisco to accelerate connections between private and public clouds, and we are pleased to be a preferred Cisco data center provider. Although many cloud services are available in the market, the management and orchestration of workloads across multiple cloud and network providers is a significant barrier to wider adoption.","Cisco intends to deploy intercloud-enabled capabilities in 16 Equinix data centers across Europe, Asia and the Americas. We are rapidly achieving critical mass in our cloud ecosystem. And the combination of robust direct connectivity and a rich feature set for Cloud Exchange are positioning Equinix as the home of the interconnected cloud.","On the enterprise side, we are increasingly engaged with innovative CIOs who are transforming their IT architectures for today's digital world and who understand the importance of data center selection and interconnection offerings in achieving their goals. The Equinix Performance Hub, in tandem with Cloud Exchange, represents a truly compelling value proposition for enterprise customers to leverage the reach and service provider density within Platform Equinix. As IT architectures migrate to the hybrid cloud and become increasingly distributed in order to deliver high application performance and enhanced user experience, the Equinix Performance Hub serves as a key lever in enabling this transformation.","Performance Hub wins this quarter include a U.S. automotive manufacturer, a global biopharmaceutical company and CDM Smith, a leading engineering and construction firm. CDM Smith is deploying Performance Hub with Cloud Exchange connections in 9 global IBX locations, leveraging a full solution created by Equinix and fulfilled together with managed services partners. This solution will allow CDM Smith to significantly optimize its private data network architecture and cost structure and enhance the performance of key applications serving their users located across 160 offices worldwide.","This win is representative of the robust solution development that Equinix is bringing to enterprises, working together with key managed services and fulfillment partners. In line with these enhanced solution development efforts, we are also augmenting our go-to-market capabilities through a channel partner program designed to increase our reach and service to the enterprise.","We are very pleased with our performance this quarter and remain encouraged by the strength and vitality of our ecosystem-centric strategy. Our mature verticals are operating at scale, with attractive customer acquisition costs, low churn and high levels of interconnection, which combine to drive healthy operating margins. The performance of these flywheel ecosystems allows us to invest in the emerging high-growth areas such as Ad-IX, electronic payments and most notably cloud through the intentional and disciplined targeting at larger strategic deployments that enables critical magnets to rapidly achieve global reach, and in turn, attract new participants.","While others may strive to emulate our strategy, we believe that our scale, global footprint, network density and ecosystem reach give us critical advantages that position us as the long-term winner in an increasingly cloud-enabled world.","So let me stop there and turn it over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.","Keith D. Taylor","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone. In the third quarter, we saw strong performance across all regions with near-record growth in net bookings. Our bookings activity produced record billable cabinet adds of approximately 3,400, 70% above the average 4-quarter trend. We added a phenomenal 5,700 cross connects and 143 exchange ports in the quarter. This clearly highlights the benefits of our current strategy.","Also, as demonstrated by our financial results and the strength of many of our key operating metrics, our ecosystem effect not only increased our revenues but preserved the attractive yields we enjoy on a per cabinet basis. As Steve outlined, capturing the cloud and enterprise opportunity is the next phase of growth for Equinix, and we're in a unique position to lead and benefit from these market changes.","To accomplish this, we need to make some investments. We need to target new and existing customers. We have to determine how to deploy our capital for new product initiatives such as Cloud Exchange and how do we augment our go-to-market efforts. We'll be making these investments alongside our key system initiatives being Equinix Customer One, which was rolled out in Asia Pacific earlier this month, in the Americas and EMEA earlier next year and our financial systems conversion to support the REIT compliance effort.","So now let me move to Slide 4 from the presentation posted today. Global Q3 revenues increased to $620.4 million, a 3% increase over the prior quarter and up 14% over the same quarter last year. Our overperformance was due to higher gross bookings, continued custom sales order activity and lower-than-planned churn. For Q3, revenue performance reflects a $2.3 million negative currency impact when compared to the average rates used last quarter and a $3.7 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance range.","Currency volatility, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Brazilian real, caused increased FX headwinds this quarter. We hedged our exposure for cost and favorable accounting treatment permit. Our cash flow hedges against the British pound, the euro and the Swiss franc reduced the FX volatility this quarter by $800,000. For Q4, we're approximately 75% hedged against our EMEA operating currencies. As we look to 2015, using the 2014 average FX rates, the strength in U.S. dollar is expected to create an FX revenue headwind of $40 million and an adjusted EBITDA headwind of $17 million. Compared to our prior guidance rate with -- sorry, compared to our prior guidance rates with current FX rates, the 2015 revenue impact is $65 million.","Global cash cost of revenues were consistent with our expectations. And cash SG&A expenses increased $140.1 million for the quarter, including approximately $7 million of REIT-related cash costs. Global adjusted EBITDA was $283.9 million, above the top end of our guidance range and up 14% year-over-year.","Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46%. The Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance reflects a negative $1.4 million currency impact when compared to Q2 average rates and a $1.8 million negative impact when compared to our FX guidance range.","Our Q3 net income was $42.8 million, which includes a substantial increase in our income tax expense, the result of a higher annual effective tax rate related to profit levels in certain jurisdictions. This higher tax impact will be mitigated upon conversion to a REIT.","Diluted earnings per share was $0.79, up significantly over the prior quarter due to the Q2 loss on debt extinguishment. For Q4, as part of the process to convert to a REIT, we expect to write off the net deferred tax asset currently on our books. This charge to net income is expected to range between $330 million and $370 million, negatively affecting our earnings per share by approximately $6 per share.","MRR churn was better than our expectations of 1.9%, a clear reflection of our strong deal discipline and our efforts to improve the overall attractiveness of our installed base. During the quarter, we were able to fully rebook the LinkedIn churn with key cloud and content customers, demonstrating our continued ability to manage and optimize our IBX assets. For Q4, we expect our MRR churn rate to be in the range between 2% and 2.5%.","Now moving to our comments on REIT. We expect to receive a favorable PLR in 2014. And we've begun operating as a REIT from a financial perspective. In October, we declared a special distribution of $416 million to our stockholders, a key requirement prior to converting to a REIT. We expect the November 2014 distribution will pay out the entirety of our estimated pre-REIT earnings and profits.","On Slide 5, we summarize the various expected REIT-related cash costs and taxes. For the full year of 2014, we now expect to incur approximately $32 million of cash costs and $21 million of capital expenditures for the REIT conversion. In 2015, we expect our ongoing REIT-related cash costs to be approximately $10 million.","Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to start reviewing the regional results, beginning with the Americas. The Americas had a strong quarter, delivering its third highest gross bookings production of all time, resulting in high fill rates and increased interconnection activity. Americas revenues increased 2% over the prior quarter and 9% over the same quarter last year.","Americas adjusted EBITDA was up 1% over the prior quarter and 7% year-over-year. As a reminder, the Americas region absorbs higher seasonal utility rates in Q3, consistent with our expectation, as well as continues to be fully burdened by the cost of the corporate functions, including the corporate IT initiatives such as the REIT conversion and Equinix Customer One. Americas adjusted EBITDA margin was 46% for the quarter.","Americas net billing cabinets increased by 1,500 in the quarter, one of its highest levels and added a record 2,600 net cross connects, which is double the prior 4-quarter average. We also added 101 exchange ports in Q3, a significant uptick. And we continue to see robust demand for interconnection products, particularly from content, cloud and network providers.","To put this demand in perspective, over the last 4 quarters, we've added more ports than over the prior 3 years cumulatively, highlighting the strong demand for the Americas digital exchanges. MRR per cabinet remained firm at very attractive levels. And while up 1% quarter-over-quarter, we expect this metric to remain stable going forward as higher power density and increased interconnection activity offset the impact of IBX and product mix and our pursuit of selective strategic and critical cloud workloads. Interconnection revenues as a percent of the region's recurring revenues increased to 21%, a new milestone that we're very pleased with.","With respect to the region's new builds, we're expanding on our Seattle 3 IBX, an important telecommunication hub with the Pacific Northwest and a distribution point for IP traffic to Asia Pacific. This build will help satisfy growing demand in the Seattle metro from cloud network and content companies. In Brazil, we're expanding our Rio de Janeiro 2 IBX to support cloud service providers and other multinational customers. We continue to expand our most strategic and interconnected campuses with an incremental phase of our DC11 assets in Ashburn.","Now looking at EMEA. Please turn to Slide 7. EMEA revenues remain very healthy, up 5% quarter-over-quarter and 18% year-over-year on a normalizing constant currency basis. This reflects strong performance in our U.K., Dutch and German businesses, with particular emphasis on capturing new cloud opportunities.","Adjusted EBITDA on a normalizing constant currency basis was up 10% over the prior quarter and up 20% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 43% due to higher interconnection revenues and a reduction in one-off costs compared to Q2. EMEA interconnection revenues increased 7% over the prior quarter and up 43% over the same quarter last year and now represents 9% of the region's recurring revenues.","We added 1,100 net cross connects in the quarter, and EMEA MRR per cabinet was up 2% on a constant currency basis. Net cabinets billing increased by approximately 1,000.","With respect to expansions, we accelerated the second phase of our Amsterdam 3 assets to respond to the increased demand from our cloud providers looking to store their critical data at this connectivity hub. Opened in October, this phase is already 20% booked from magnet cloud and content providers expanding into this European digital gateway.","And now looking at Asia Pacific. Please refer to Slide 8. In Asia Pacific, revenues were $111.4 million, a 6% increase over prior quarter and up 24% over the same quarter last year on a normalizing constant currency basis, driven by strong gross bookings in cloud and IT services and network segments.","Adjusted EBITDA on a normalizing constant currency basis was up 4% over last quarter and 32% over the same quarter last year. MRR per cabinet remains firm, slightly up quarter-over-quarter on a constant currency basis, and cabinets billing increased by 900 over the prior quarter. Net cross-connect addition has doubled from last quarter to a record 2,000. And interconnection revenues remained at 12% of the region's recurring revenues.","We opened new IBX phases in our Osaka and Singapore markets this quarter, and we continue to expand across all our major Asian metros. In Japan, we're now moving forward with our new Tokyo 5 IBX, located adjacent to our successful Tokyo 3 IBX. This expansion will enable new customers to access our rich financial services ecosystem in Tokyo as well as support demand from cloud and content providers.","And now looking at the balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 9. We ended the quarter with approximately $500 million of unrestricted cash and investments on our balance sheet, a decrease over the prior quarter level, primarily due to the purchase of our noncontrolling minority interest in ALOG.","Our net debt leverage ratio increased slightly to 3.1x our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Also, we settled the remainder of our 3% 2014 convertible notes in exchange for 1.6 million shares upon maturity in mid-October. Under the share repurchase program, we repurchased 43 million in Q3. As we finish out the year, we'll continue to evaluate additional opportunities to optimize our balance sheet and capital structure.","Now switching to Slide 10. Our Q3 operating cash flow increased over the prior quarter to $216 million, a significant improvement over the prior quarter due to decreased tax payments related to REIT and non-REIT-related obligations and more cash interest payments.","However, despite this positive trend, our DSOs increased to 39 days. As the organization continues to gain experience with our new billing system and processes, we expect this trend to reverse over the next few quarters.","For 2014, we are raising our guidance for AFFO to be greater than $745 million due to increased expectations from adjusted EBITDA. And this absorbs the $5 million negative FX headwind compared to the prior FX rates. As a reminder, AFFO includes approximately $32 million of REIT-related conversion costs in 2014.","We expect our 2014 adjusted discretionary free cash flow to now range between $590 million and $620 million and adjusted free cash flow to be greater than $160 million. Compared to our prior guidance, these cash flow metrics reflect changes in our working capital expectations as well as an increase in our capital expansion initiatives.","And now looking at capital expenditures. Please turn to Slide 11. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $156 million, including recurring capital expenditures of $20 million, slightly below our prior guidance. We currently have 13 announced expansion projects underway across the globe, of which 11 are campus builds or incremental phase builds.","And finally, turning to Slide 12. The operating performance of our stabilized 69 global IBX and expansion projects that had been open for more than 1 year continue to perform well, with revenues up 7% on a year-over-year basis. Currently, these projects generate a 31% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested and are 82% utilized.","I'll turn the call back to Steve now.","Stephen M. Smith","Okay. Thanks, Keith. Let me now cover our outlook for 2014 on Slide 13. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect revenues to be in the range of $627 million to $631 million, which absorbs $11 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to our prior guidance rates. Cash gross margins are expected to approximate 68% to 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $139 million.","Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $291 million and $295 million, which includes $6 million in costs related to the REIT conversion and absorbs a negative foreign currency impact of $5 million compared to prior guidance rates. Capital expenditures are expected to be $210 million to $230 million, which includes approximately $35 million of recurring capital expenditures.","For the full year of 2014, we are raising revenues to now range between $2.433 billion and $2.437 billion or a 13% year-over-year growth rate. This absorbs $15 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to prior guidance rates. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, the revised revenues range reflects a $20 million increase compared to our prior midpoint guidance.","Full year cash gross margins are expected to range between 68% and 69%. Cash SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $553 million. We are raising adjusted EBITDA to now range between $1.110 billion and $1.114 billion. This revised guidance includes $32 million in costs related to our REIT conversion efforts and absorbs $8 million of negative foreign currency impact compared to prior guidance rates.","Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, the revised adjusted EBITDA range reflects a $10 million increase compared to our prior midpoint guidance. We expect 2014 capital expenditures to range between $630 million and $650 million, which includes approximately $110 million of recurring capital expenditures.","So in closing, we are executing our strategy of driving differentiated growth, reflected in the strong performance of our core ecosystems and record interconnection activity. We believe Equinix is the best location to access the variety of cloud services critical to managing enterprise workloads. And we continue to close strategic deals driven by the strength of new offers like Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange.","Going forward, we remain focused on leveraging the advantages of our global footprint, driving both network and cloud services density and distancing ourselves from the competition through innovative products and investments in Platform Equinix.","So let me stop here and open it up for questions. I'll turn it back over to you, Rachel.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Mr. David Barden of Bank of America.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess a couple, if I could. Just first, Keith, I think you said you were going to maybe kind of look opportunistically at CapEx -- or capital structure and balance sheet opportunities in the fourth quarter. I believe the original intention for the stock buyback program was to complete it in 2014. I was wondering if you could kind of comment on whether that's still the intention. The second thing was just getting some questions on your assumptions that the euro and pound foreign exchange rates relative to your -- relative to spot rates are going to improve in the fourth quarter. I'm assuming that has something to do with your hedging game plan, but that'll be good to know. And then the last thing, again maybe for Steve or Keith. I think in Keith's comments, he referenced something about investments that need to be made to attack the cloud opportunity. And I was wondering if that was trying to foreshadow some kind of CapEx or operational type of expense that might be -- we need to start thinking about for 2015.","Keith D. Taylor","Okay, David. So let me take the first couple, and then Charles or Steve will take the last one. I think when we look at capital structure, it's clear to me as we continue to move towards conversion to a REIT and recognizing where we may spend our capital dollars, all else being equal, given where the market is, there's still an opportune time to raise capital relatively inexpensively. And so one of the things that we've said before, to the extent that we do raise capital, particularly given that we've taken out the 2014 conversion over hopefully not too long distance, we'll take out the 2016 converts, we'll have the capacity to put more debt on the balance sheet and use it effectively. So that would be one thing that we will continue to look at. There's no commitments yet other than we are actively looking at the opportunities that are present in the marketplace. Also, I'd tell you that given the size of our revolving line of credit, that's another area that you expect us to change as we exit the year and start operating as a REIT effective 1\/1\/15 so that would be one other area that we would actually look at. As it relates to our share repurchase program, we have roughly 150 -- sorry, $150 million left on the program. And clearly, we will use the cash opportunistically, taking into consideration some of the other decisions that we're going to make about how to spend our capital. So clearly, that is what's spent, roughly $350 million to date. We'll continue to look at that opportunistically. As it relates to FX, a couple of things. Number one, when we look at the FX rates, particularly on the forward guidance relative to spot rate, you're absolutely right. We've had -- as I said in my prepared comments, where we can get favorable accounting treatment, that's particularly around the euro, the sterling and the Swiss franc, with the functional currency of our businesses effectively the U.S. dollar, and it is in that case, we will -- we can put hedges that actually effectively hedge against the lines in which we're trying to protect such as revenue or whether it's cost or EBITDA. So for that purpose, we have put some hedges in place. As I said, we're roughly 75% hedged for Q -- in Q4. We're less hedged as we move into 2015, but we're roughly 50% hedged in Q -- sorry, 80% hedged in Q1 and 60% hedged in Q2 of next year. Again, those rates will vary over a period of time. And I think, David, I want to leave you and certainly the rest of the investors with clearly when we put our hedging programs in place, what we're trying to do is mitigate, of course, the effect -- the volatility in currency. But over time, again, what we're -- to the extent that the euro is going to continue to trend down, what we're really doing is giving ourselves a soft landing as that currency continues to weaken, if at all. So I think we're well positioned from a hedging perspective as we look into 20 -- into Q4 and the beginning of 2015.","Charles Meyers","Yes, and David, this is Charles. I'll take the last piece relative to some of the investments. As the results demonstrate, we continue to see very significant momentum in certain building the cloud ecosystem, both on the service provider side as well as sort of significant early traction on the enterprise or the buy side of the ecosystem. And we intend to continue to invest behind that momentum given that we see the cloud overall as really quite a transformational opportunity and growth opportunity for the company. So there's probably several categories in this of investment that we would be looking to incorporate into our 2015 plan and through the remainder of this year. One, on the product side, really building on the momentum of our Performance Hub and our Cloud Exchange offers to continue to add feature functions to those and make sure that those are the leading platforms from a cloud perspective in the industry, which we're very confident is the case. Secondly, on go-to-market, we're going to continue to invest in our solution architect team, which has really been critical to ensuring customers can leverage those offers to their benefit as they implement their hybrid cloud architectures as well as our -- we'll probably selectively augment the direct force in response to continued strong demand and then also continue to invest in our channel program, in our professional services capability, both of which are really designed around: one, completing whole offers by sort of adding third-party value-add to our core offers and then expanding our reach from a distribution perspective as we -- particularly as we tackle the enterprise market. And then finally, sort of targeted demand generation, again probably focused on the enterprise and really building off of our lighthouse wins, several of which we talked about in the script, and in fact, have talked about a handful of them in every script for the last several quarters. And now what we're beginning to see is a broader -- people sort of looking to those lighthouse wins and saying, \"Hey, if they're doing it, we ought to be considering it,\" and people who are implementing hybrid cloud and using Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange to do that. So we'll probably be putting money behind increased awareness and demand generation activity to build off of that momentum.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I have a question about Open IX. A lot of the folks that I speak to, including myself, have been a little bit concerned about the development of Open IX in the U.S. And one of the things that Open IX talks about is kind of connecting its locations with a fiber ring and sort of extending its density that way, which is very much, as I understand it, the way that the London Internet Exchange works. Now you guys have been very successful across Europe, in London in particular, in terms of winning key customers. And maybe if you could give us some insight into how you compete there and how you differentiate there while sitting on that ring to give us a little bit more confidence in how you guys will defend against any sort of perceived move here in the U.S.","Stephen M. Smith","Sure. Jonathan, this is Steve. I'll start and I'm sure Charles can probably supplement here. A couple of data points. First of all, after 16-plus years, we have a critical mass, as you all know, of cross connects and ports on our switch fabrics and a couple of switch fabrics now that we're deploying, one with the Internet switch fabric that's been around for a long time and more recently our cloud switch fabrics. So if you just purely look at the results that Keith mentioned in this quarter, just in the Americas, where the Open IX is -- I think the heart of your question is before we go to Europe. Just to remind you guys, we added 2,600 net cross connects just in Q3 and over 101 ports in the Americas alone. And as Keith mentioned, that -- over the last 4 quarters, we've added more ports in the U.S. than we have the prior 3 years cumulatively. So that tells you something that the value that we're delivering and the leadership position and the critical mass that we've accumulated is still advantaging us. So there's no discernible impact to Equinix really at this point. Like any competition, we are tracking it closely in the U.S. We'll continue to monitor these alternative exchanges. But our real focus is on the next generation of interconnection, advantaging our leadership position and continue to deliver a superior peering model to our customers. And I think the scale and advantage we have there is proving out in the metrics. I don't know, Charles, if you'll add anything. Maybe...","Charles Meyers","Well, all I'd say is I think although the industry structure is slightly different in Europe than it is in the U.S. and Open IX is, I guess to some degree, attempting to shift some of that industry structure and introduce a dynamic that looks more like the European model, I would argue that the fundamental basis of competition on the exchange market -- or in the exchange market isn't meaningfully different across its various regions. At the end of the day, the customer is making a fundamental decision about how effectively they can peer their traffic. And they're looking at a range of options that goes from transit to private peering -- I'm sorry, to public peer to private peering. And the reality is the most effective way to do that, typically if you have -- particularly if you have large volumes of traffic, is to ensure that you can peer off traffic to the right counterparties most effectively. And when you look at the results that -- I mean, that Steve has articulated in terms of our port growth, it's very clear that customers are voting with their wallet relative to how they can do that most effectively and they're doing with Equinix. So they can move from: one, accessing transit partners; two, then peering their exchange -- their traffic over a public exchange inside the facility. And then quite importantly, when they get traffic between a counterparty to a certain level, they want to pull that off in private period over cross connect. And them being able to do that inside of an Equinix facility where we have a very high critical mass of participants is just much more effective for them. And so in the end, we feel very good about the product. We continue to invest in its future functionality. And I think if you look at our momentum compared to what limited growth and trajectory that we're seeing from Open IX participants, I think we feel very good about where we are.","Stephen M. Smith","The only thing I'd add, Jonathan, is as Charles said, the traction in the U.S. is negligible. But in Europe, if you listen to our team in Europe, those 3 firms are doing well. And actually, they're growing in our facilities and we're benefiting from that. So we're -- they're getting the port growth and we're getting the colocation growth. So if you talk to Eric and his team in Europe, he's still growing on the back of the relationship that we have with all 3 of those in Europe. So the dynamics are a little different between the 2 regions. We're competing in Americas. We're working together in Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to touch on a bit of a bigger picture question here around the enterprise arena. I was wondering if you could give us a bit more color in terms of the type of traction you folks are seeing here overall in the enterprise. Clearly, it seems as though cloud-based opportunity seemed to be reaching a tipping point for you folks. But I was hoping that you could see how -- or at least get a little bit more insight on how we should think about when we should start to begin to see similar momentum on the enterprise front. Clearly, you guys have a number of partnerships, most recently with Cisco, as you mentioned on the prepared remarks. I would love to hear how these partnerships have been resonating with some of your potential customers.","Stephen M. Smith","Why don't I start, Charles, and let's double team this again. I think there's a lot going on here in the enterprise. It's a good question, Amir. First of all, if you talk to any CIO or the head of applications or head of infrastructure in any company -- any enterprise company today, they're going to tell you that they're faced with a variety of disruptive forces going on. One, they've got congested network issues. They have performance and security limitations that they're challenged with. And then more recently, their user experience is becoming more social and more mobile. So most of the clients we're dealing with are pushing to rearchitect their IT to be able to access the hybrid cloud. So they're all studying. Some are further ahead than others. And they're doing that in a distributed hub architecture. So that's why you hear us, and that's why we develop a network Performance Hub, which is to address this distributed hub architecture that they're going to want to get to, to get to the -- to ultimately get to the hybrid cloud. So they're reinventing their wide area networks, their local area networks. Their workplaces are becoming virtual. Their hybrid cloud is the choice of the future. That's been validated pretty much anywhere you look or talk to. So there's a lot going on there. Now we have to get use cases built and we're doing that. You hear about that every quarter. Our approach to this is to get the cloud access nodes, the cloud service nodes, get our data centers as populated as possible with these access nodes so that enterprises can look inside of these data centers and see the cloud density and network density they need to put private workload in there to enable the hybrid cloud. They can connect private to public cloud access points and create the hybrid cloud. So there's a lot going on in the marketing function of the company to build these use cases. And as you get to an industry vertical and you get a use case started, then the rest of vertical will follow suit. So we have a lot of that going on today.","Charles Meyers","Yes. I mean, just maybe a couple of things. I think that again, we're seeing very strong momentum on the service provider side of the cloud. We are getting these sort of key lighthouse wins on the enterprise side that leverage our Performance Hub offering. And interestingly actually, the momentum on the enterprise is across a range of enterprise types. We talk about enterprise distinctly from cloud, content, digital media, financial services, et cetera. But in reality, all of those companies are enterprises and they have very distinct enterprise needs. And what we've been able to do is actually to leverage our relationships with them and leverage the fact that they already use us for many of their revenue-facing applications to meet their enterprise requirements. And that is their ability to deliver distributed applications with high performance, get anything anywhere to all of their users in the enterprise, moving to a more distributed architecture that allows for the high-performance application delivery. And so those lighthouse wins are really starting to open the eyes of the broader enterprise community. And I think when we're -- so we see that momentum. And I think when we're really going to start to see it at a new level is as we ramp up our go-to-market capabilities. We have relatively small direct enterprise selling force today. We're selling across all -- our enterprise offers across all our verticals. But as we ramp the professional services in the channel, that's when I really think we're going to begin to see it contribute more meaningfully. And we've been prudent about what pace that's going to be in our planning, but we think we're excited about the investments we're making in 2015 and believe that we'll begin to see those very positively impact our numbers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. So I have a question around the interconnect. The networks are very strong, and Keith sounded very optimistic about the outlook going forward. And I just wondered how to think about that in terms of translating to gross margins starting to ramp and even margins starting to ramp. They've been fairly flat in most regions except for Asia Pac. So that's kind of my financial question. And then I wondered, we've been kind of talking around this in terms of sales headcount and solutions architect, but can you kind of quantify where you are now and what your targets are for sales force and solutions architecture?","Keith D. Taylor","Good question, Jonathan. So a couple of things. Number one, yes, we are quite optimistic about what we're doing with interconnection and how we see that continue to scale, not only within the Americas but across the broader platform. So I think the benefit that you're going to see is interconnection revenues, there was roughly a 50 basis point improvement on a total company basis in interconnection revenue as a percent of our total recurring revenue this quarter. All 3 regions were up. The company therefore as a whole was up, and that's, obviously, a net positive. Equally, from a positive perspective, we are continuing to increase, if you will, the product density in some of our deployments. And both of those are driving, if you will, more profit into the system. The offsetting part of that, of course, is our product mix and also some of our IBX. And as we alluded to, we're also being very thoughtful about some of these larger cloud-based strategic footprints that we're taking. And so what offsets some of that -- some of the successes, of course, is some of those decisions we make. As Charles alluded to, I think we're being thoughtful and very prudent about the decisions we make, recognizing overall, we believe that cash gross margins are still -- we're still driving for a 70% or better cash gross margin line. And we're still driving towards a 50% or greater EBITDA line. All that said, we also want to make investments. Again, when you look at the size of the opportunity that we see out there, and again, Steve and Charles alluded to it, in a way that when you think about trying to capture that enterprise and continue to win the cloud business that exists in the marketplace, you got to scale the business. And one of the ways that we're going to scale is, of course, adapting our go-to-market strategy, looking at the channels, looking at the solution architects, looking at how we create more demand gen, investing our technology and our technology platforms behind Ihab and Brian Lillie. So for all those reasons, I would tell you that we're making great headroom -- headway and continuing to drive leverage in the business and scale and profitability. But we're taking some of that value and we're putting it into the future of our business because we think that's going to be really important as we look towards us being a much larger company than we are today.","Stephen M. Smith","Sales headcount, Charles?","Charles Meyers","Yes. So sales headcount, we are right now in the sort of 225-ish range globally for quota-bearing headcount. We had talked about 250 as a range that we could easily see getting to. I think we're doing that quite selectively in terms of where we see the demand there in markets or verticals that we -- where we want to make additions. So I think I can see us getting over a period of a few quarters up to that 250 type range. And then on the solution architect side, we're looking at probably adding another dozen or 2 of those over the course of the next several quarters just given the success we've seen in terms of them being able to really help our customers identify how Platform Equinix can fit in to most typically their sort of hybrid cloud architecture strategy. And so those are sort of the level of investments we're making. But importantly, I think also of note is that with the way we're going to get leverage in the long term is by also spooling up partners that can provide some of the professional service solution architect type capabilities as well as some of the sales reach from a distribution perspective. So we're looking at probably investing in the indirect side of our business from a channel program standpoint to the tune of 50 or more people in 2015. And obviously, we'll ramp that up in a disciplined fashion. But we can -- that's a big investment, a big focus area for '15.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just real quick on the channel program, as that does start to ramp, how do we think about the margin impact on that? Does it affect either way if the channel partners do account for a bigger portion of your incremental sales?","Charles Meyers","Not really. The cost of sale won't be meaningfully different, I don't think, for us in terms of the indirect. It might be, particularly in the early days as we probably look to invest in the level of channel harmony and making sure that we have a good collaboration between our direct force and the channel out there. You may have a slightly higher cost of sale. But I also think that we're going to be able to, particularly with some of those channels targeting certain enterprise segments with our Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange offers, which we believe have a very strong value proposition. I think we'll be able to sustain kind of the price points margins that we're accustomed to. So I don't see that as meaningfully different, and I certainly don't see it in terms of having any kind of meaningful negative impact on our overall margin structure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I have 2. First off, as it relates to CapEx, when I look at your buildout in terms of cabinets the last few years, it's been fairly consistent. And also, the cost on a per cabinet basis is somewhere around $50,000. Is there any reason to think that as we go into 2015, the number of cabinets you tend to build out and also the cost of those cabinets would change very much? And then also, as it relates to the cloud business, you talked about adding some larger cloud deployments, magnet customers as you referred to them. What do you anticipate the overall impact of those deals being on MRR per cabinet, particularly in the United States or the Americas as we go into 2015?","Charles Meyers","Yes, Colby, Keith and I can tag team this a bit. I think in terms of capital expansion, I think we're going to -- we're looking with some granularity as to where we need to invest given the demand. I don't think there would be a dramatic difference in terms of the pace of buildout. I do think we're looking at whether or not some of the large footprint opportunity that we are exploring and seeing in the cloud space will require us to make some incremental investment there. But that's something I think that we'll probably give you little more clarity around come our guidance in February. As to the cost per cabinet, we are constantly striving to sort of drive our cost per cabinet down while at the same time ensuring that we're delivering the premium quality service delivery that our customers require given the premium nature of their applications. So again, we're trying to drive it down to some degree from a continuous improvement standpoint. But I think the number that you articulate there, which is on the order of $50,000 a cab, is probably a reasonable planning number. And again, we'll probably continue to chip away at that, but that's probably not going to -- I wouldn't say change dramatically. And then lastly, as it relates to these big cloud footprints, honestly, we have been pursuing those as part of this sort of disciplined cloud ecosystem strategy for several quarters. And despite that, as you can see in our results, we've continued to maintain very attractive levels of yield. And that is because there are a number of levers available to us in terms of: one, driving interconnection growth, which as you can see, was very healthy this quarter; and continuing to manage power densities in the facilities with some rigor and some care that allows us to really sort of offset some of -- if we are taking on a cloud footprint that may not ramp from interconnection standpoint immediately or it will take some time to for an ecosystem effect to build to up around that, honestly, we continue to have levers that we believe will allow us to sort of maintain stability in the yield. And so that's where we are, and the results have showed that over the last several quarters.","Keith D. Taylor","Colby, I would just add one thing. The other thing I think that's important to add to what Charles said, we also -- when we think about CapEx for 2015 beyond -- and beyond, we want to continue to be very disciplined about how we deploy that capital. But as you're aware, we also have 13 projects of size and scale today that are underway such as a Toronto or Singapore 3 or a London 6 large deployment. And so we're going to be very measured about how we deploy our capital on a go-forward basis. And I think Charles is absolutely right about the comment that we're going to -- it's going to be roughly in and around the same order of magnitude. But we're also going to reserve the right to take the opportunity when it exists. But as you can appreciate, it takes a long time to build out some of these assets. So as we continually think about how to deploy capital, our teams are already thinking about '15, '16 and '17. And so I feel we're in a very good position to moderate the consumption of our capital on a go-forward basis and be thoughtful and prudent about how that gets deployed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Michael Bowen of Pacific Crest.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","A couple of housekeeping things. I'm not sure I heard on enterprise. I think you gave out the percentage of revs the last couple of quarters. If you could provide that, that would be terrific. And then with regard to the recurring CapEx definition as it pertains to AFFO, do you guys have an update on that? Has that been finalized? And then finally, with regard to Performance Hub, you announced some wins. How can we think about that as far as revenue impact and margin impact going forward? If you can help us think about that, that would be terrific.","Keith D. Taylor","Okay. So let me take the middle one, if I could. And just as we get -- as we sort of -- and then Charles and Steve will take the other 2. So as it relates to AFFO, as I said, this quarter, we're raising our guidance to greater than $745 million. It includes a $5 million headwind relative to currency. And when you add in the $32 million of what I call REIT-related operating costs, you get a sense of roughly greater than $780 million. That also assumes, as you know, $110 million of recurring CapEx. There are still 2 lines. So when you look at basically the results that we've provided on the earnings deck, the PowerPoint presentation, there's a couple of areas that we're still looking at to make sure we look at our peer group, we look at [indiscernible] and we look at what makes a good sense for us. And so we're continuing to refine that. And so I'd ask that you just give us patience for at least one more quarter as we continue to work through that. But suffice it to say, when you look at CapEx, the $110 million that we allocate to recurring, which is about 4.5% of revenues, it has the potential potentially to change a little bit depending on how we allocate that small bucket of -- that bucket of cost.","Stephen M. Smith","Could you remind us the initial question?","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Yes, the other question was with regard to Performance Hub, with regard to how impactful, with regard to revenue and how should we think about it from an incremental margin standpoint. The other was the percentage of revenue on enterprise. I think last quarter, if I'm not mistaken, it was 11%, up from 9% the prior quarter. If you have that, that would be great.","Charles Meyers","Yes, I think the deck shows that again, you have to understand that we are -- we separate out an enterprise vertical that we distinguish from our other verticals, financial services, content, digital media, cloud, et cetera. And that one is also -- that 11% now is shown in the deck, I think on Page 15 of the deck that we posted today. But one thing that is very important to remember is that the momentum of our enterprise class offers, if you will, is not necessarily reflected just in that number because the number of the buyers of those are customers who live in other verticals at least in our classification. In fact, our largest wins to date have been with customers -- well, some of our largest wins today have been with customers that live in the other verticals in our categorization. So for example, we referenced a very large global Performance Hub with an online banking -- for an online banking application that we have this quarter. That would be -- that would fall in our financial services revenue line. And we also had some with content and digital media or cloud customers that would be in there. And so that's what we're seeing in terms of momentum for our enterprise class applications. Having said that though, we definitely are seeing momentum in what we categorize as the rest of the broader enterprise or what our CMO likes to refer to as the other -- the rest of the enterprise. And in fact, that category is our largest source of new logos, and we've been very effective in getting in there, getting admittedly smaller wins and then really being able to land and expand from a geography and a product set standpoint with them.","Michael G. Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And I guess where I was going with the Performance Hub, Steve, was maybe to put a finer point on there. Principally, the question is one of the things that I've been getting questions on is with regard to Performance Hub and Cloud Exchange. Technically, I guess, isn't there an opportunity cost for incremental revenue that might be going directly to the cloud provider rather than incremental revenue within your data center? But I'm assuming you're going to answer that in a way that -- or in a manner in that the overall incremental impact is positive. But can you help us think about the puts and takes there as far as opportunity cost but then offset by an increase in revenue to the -- for the Direct Connect to the cloud provider?","Charles Meyers","Yes, I mean, I think what you're getting at is probably a very common question that we get, which is if people are taking workloads and moving them directly into the public cloud, doesn't that represent a net reduction in the sort of colo opportunity? And the reality is, is that in aggregate, that may be true across the broad colocation market. But as it relates to Equinix, who tends to play in a very specific sort of premium application segment where people are moving workloads that are -- require network density, global reach, ecosystem reach and sort of mission-critical performance, we see it as a very sort of net positive opportunity for us. And so what we're able to do is we look at enterprises who may, in fact, be looking to move certain applications from their basement into a hybrid cloud architecture. And they may take stuff that was living in their data center and move some of that, particularly back office applications or other nonperformance sensitive applications, into a cloud environment. But the way they're going to do that is they're going to purchase a Performance Hub implementation from us across probably a global reach, a global opportunity for us, 3 or 4 or 5 locations, interconnect that to Cloud Exchange and then move their workloads through that Performance Hub. And so we see it very much as an upside opportunity for us.","Stephen M. Smith","Michael, the simplest way to think about this, these are service offerings, both of them, that help customers connect their workloads to public cloud access points. So the cloud exchange is trying to accelerate that specifically. The network Performance Hub, we've been utilizing for several quarters. And it's to help a CIO who's distributing their wide area network in a more optimized, cost-effective, higher-performance way to get -- to solve all the challenges that they're all seeing with mobile, social, cloud, et cetera. So these are service offerings that actually is helping customers connect to cloud access points -- or access nodes. And when you consider that 80-some percent of the IT spend in the world today is sitting in-house, on-premise and a lot of that stuff is being predicted to come out to the market, get colo-ed or outsourced or managed service, we're going to catch a lot of that workload that's coming out to the market in the future because they're going to look inside of Equinix and they're going to see all this network density. They're going to see all this cloud density and they're going to say, \"That's how we can build a solution, the multi-cloud, multi-network drives that I need to go run my company.\" As we've mentioned to you guys multiple times, even Equinix as a $2.5 billion company uses 30 to 35 cloud providers just to run our IT. That's exactly what we see happening with enterprises today. We're trying to figure out how to get to the multi-cloud environment. And these too -- these are offerings to help them do that.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Mr. Mike McCormack of Jefferies.","Michael McCormack - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Maybe just a comment, Keith, that you gave on the MMR (sic) [MRR] outlook in the 4Q. What are the key drivers around that? And then thinking about cloud installments in particular, any differences in what you're seeing in churn among those installments?","Keith D. Taylor","Yes, Mike, at least from an MRR perspective or we refer to as yield, there's really no change that we're -- no meaningful change that we're expecting in Q4. And again, as you can appreciate, given the size of our installed base now, any movement in either direction is going to be relatively dramatic over a short period of time for us to meaningfully adjust those metrics. So that all said, we feel confident in the firmness of our metric both on a global basis as we calculate globally. We're up roughly 1%, I think, quarter-over-quarter and 3% year-over-year. We feel very good about the firmness of that metric. And it gets supported by the fact that, as I said earlier, increasing infrastructure density and the deployment, increasing interconnection and then just the volume of opportunity we see. All of that would lead me to believe that we're going to continue to be playing in this range for the foreseeable future.","Charles Meyers","Yes, and Michael, let me take the second one with regard to the sort of cloud footprint and the churn dynamics around those. What I would say is that for the most part, cloud is a relatively newer phenomenon over the last several years in terms of driving significant deployments. And so we're probably inside of the sort of contract length on many of those. But what I would say is that we have developed over the last several years a very robust understanding of the churn dynamics in our business and what represents a deployment that is going to be sort of subject to churn or price compression versus those that are going to have high -- very high levels of retention and therefore higher customer lifetime value. And what I would tell you is that the dynamics of churn -- of cloud deployments tend to really favor them being high retention, high lifetime value deployments. And the reason is several-fold: one, they tend to be revenue facing; two, they tend to be very well interconnected; and three, they tend to be global and so they're deployed cross region, cross metro. And we actually have a pretty hard handle, analytical handle, on something we call our -- it's basically an index that we have where we can calculate the likely retention of deployments based on those dynamics. And I would tell you that generally, cloud deployments stack up very well along those dimensions.","Katrina Rymill","Thank you. That concludes our Q3 call. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."]}}
