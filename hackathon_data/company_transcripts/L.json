Edelson - Loews Corp.","Analysts","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Operator","My name is Nicole and I'll be your conference operator this morning. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Loews' Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Skafidas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. You may begin.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Loews' second quarter earnings conference call. A copy of our earnings release, earnings supplement and company overview may be found on our website, loews.com.","On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Edelson. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session, which will include questions submitted via email by our shareholders.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward-looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those made or implied in any forward-looking statements due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings.","Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is only a brief statement of the company's statutory forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included in the company's filings with the SEC.","During the call today, we might also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our security filings and earnings supplement for a reconciliation to those most comparable GAAP measures.","In a few minutes, our CFO, David Edelson will walk you through the key drivers for the quarter, but before he does Jim Tisch, our CEO, will kick off the call. Jim, over to you.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Overall, Loews had a great quarter, and operating results were strong across the board. But instead of simply focusing on quarterly results as was once my custom, on today's call, I'd like to continue my recent practice of speaking in detail on a single topic of interest. Specifically, I'd like to talk a bit about the benefits of diversification with regard to our portfolio of businesses using the recent histories of CNA and Diamond Offshore as examples.","It has long been our belief that having a diversified portfolio of businesses subject to different market cycles offers the best way to deliver superior returns over the long-term. However, operating in diverse industries does mean that, at any given time, our subsidiaries can face vastly different market environments, some hospitable and others more challenging. CNA and Diamond today illustrate the point. Over the last few years, CNA has been on the upswing while Diamond now operates in an industry facing a protracted down cycle.","Let's focus on the positive first and take a look at CNA and the commercial property and casualty insurance market. Over the last year, CNA's total return to shareholders was more than 70%. While CNA was just as strong financially a year ago as it is today, the market seems to have finally caught on. A little less than 20 years ago, CNA was an insurance company that had lost its way trying to be all things to all people with no focused strategy. Today, the company has been transformed into a consistently profitable commercial P&C insurance carrier with strong operating results and an intense focus on underwriting fundamentals.","Let me give you a little history. Steve Lilienthal, CNA's CEO from 2001 to 2009 had the arduous task of streamlining the company. He divested certain lines of business that were not core to CNA, such as reinsurance, life insurance and personal lines. It sounds easy in retrospect, but at the time it was grueling and Steve did an excellent job riding the ship.","When Steve retired in 2009, Tom Motamed became the CEO and focused CNA on improving its market position in specialty and commercial lines, creating a culture of underwriting discipline and making sure that the company had adequate reserves. This new direction helped modify CNA's balance sheet which remains rock solid to this day.","In November of last year, industry veteran Dino Robusto joined CNA, ready, willing, able and chomping at the bit to lead the company through its next phase of growth and profitability.","CNA's longstanding goal is to post best-in-class underwriting results and it's getting closer to that achievement every day. CNA's loss ratio is basically in line with, if not better than its top tier competitors. However, its expense ratio tends to be higher than its competition, which management is addressing. The bottom-line is that while CNA has come a long way, we believe there is still ample runway for value creation and we believe that Dino, with his energy, experience and vision is the right individual to get the job done.","If you look at CNA's earnings results for this quarter, you'll see he's already been hard at work. The company had a combined ratio of 93.5% primarily due to improved underwriting performance.","In stark contrast to CNA's upswing, Diamond Offshore is operating in an industry that continues to face one of the sharpest downturns in its history. Contracts have been cancelled, leading edge day rates are oftentimes at or below operating costs and oil prices remain well below levels of a few years ago. Despite the pain, Diamond's CEO, Mark Edwards, and his team continued to navigate these troubled waters with tireless focus, skill and determination. And while the short to medium term outlook for the offshore drilling market remains bleak, Diamond has maintained its relative strength and all of its newbuild drilling rigs are operating under long-term contracts at an average rate of $450,000 per day.","The company has also been exploring new ways to differentiate itself from its competitors and provide better value to its customers. While we don't know exactly when the offshore drilling market will recover, we do not doubt the inevitability of a recovery. Steep declines in existing oilfields will hit the market in the next few years and growth in offshore oil production will be needed to meet demand.","Offshore oil is a significant part of the global supply mix that we believe cannot and will not be replaced by conventional offshore drilling or shale production. Today, we're seeing the faintest of green shoots as the offshore drilling industry moves towards product standardization and simplification.","So, in conclusion, let's remember that it was only about five years ago that Diamond was Loews' largest subsidiary by market value, supplying the lion's share of our cash flow. Back then, CNA was just beginning its rise, yet today, the roles are reversed. Owning companies in a variety of industries offers the safeguard to shareholders against volatility in any one sector.","Looking back at our history, we can clearly see that operating in diverse industries has given Loews a distinct advantage in its quest to create long-term value for its shareholders, a commitment that has defined Loews for more than 50 years.","And now over to David.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $231 million or $0.69 per share, up from a loss of $65 million or $0.19 per share in last year's second quarter. Diamond Offshore and CNA Financial accounted for the bulk of the $296 million year-over-year positive earnings swing, while parent company investment income was the main detractor versus the prior year.","Lower rig impairments at Diamond contributed to the year-over-year improvement. Rig impairments reduced Loews' net income in Q2 2016 by $267 million whereas in this year's second quarter the impairments' hit dropped to $23 million. Excluding the Diamond impairments, Loews' net income was $254 million in Q2 2017, up from $202 million in Q2 2016. The key drivers for the quarter are set forth on page 12 of our earnings supplement, which has been posted to our investor relations website.","CNA had an excellent quarter and was by far the largest contributor to our consolidated net income at $244 million. This represents a $55 million or 29% year-to-year increase. Two factors drove this increase. Stronger P&C underwriting income and higher realized investment gains. Net investment income was in fact down slightly year-over-year, given a modest fall-off in LP results. The improvement in P&C underwriting income came from a meaningfully lower combined ratio. CNA's calendar year combined ratio declined from 97.4% in Q2 2016 to 93.5% in this year's second quarter, a 3.9-point improvement on $1.6 billion of quarterly net earned premiums.","Given the catastrophe losses and favorable prior year development essentially offset one another this quarter, I would highlight the improvement in CNA's combined ratio, excluding cats and prior year development, also known as the non-cat accident year combined ratio. Specifically, the company's non-cat accident year combined ratio dropped 3.7 points from 98.3 in Q2 2016 to 94.6 in this year's second quarter. All three of CNA's P&C segments, Specialty, Commercial and International, showed excellent year-over-year improvement. The improvement was particularly notable in the company's Commercial and International segments, as those non-cat accident year combined ratios dropped by 3.2 points and 14.2 points, respectively.","This quarter highlights CNA's enhanced underwriting discipline, its ongoing favorable prior year development and its focus on expense control. Dino Robusto and his team are singularly focused on continual improvement across CNA, building on the solid foundation created by Tom Motamed during his tenure as CEO.","Turning to Diamond Offshore. While Diamond contributed only $7 million to our net income this quarter, that is over $300 million more than last year's second quarter. The previously mentioned rig impairments accounted for most of the year-over-year swing. That said, even after excluding the impairment charges, Diamond's contribution to our net income increased $57 million year-over-year, driven mainly by higher contract drilling revenues, strong cost controls, reduced depreciation expense owing to last year's rig impairments and a lower effective tax rate.","Boardwalk posted excellent results in the quarter after excluding a one-time loss associated with the sale of a gas processing facility, and related gathering assets. The loss decreased Boardwalk's contribution to our net income by $15 million, thus accounting for the year-to-year decline in net income contribution. Absent this loss however, Boardwalk would have contributed $21 million to our Q2 2017 net income versus $17 million last year. And remember that in last year's second quarter, Boardwalk benefited from the legal settlement that increased its net income contribution by $4 million.","Loews Hotels also had a good quarter, with net income of $10 million. During last year's second quarter the company wrote down an equity investment in one of its joint venture hotel property. So, while the year-over-year net income comparison was still favorable, it's not as dramatic as it first appears.","The Hotel company's adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the write-down in other non-recurring items was $61 million for the quarter, up from $56 million in Q2 2016. The increase was principally driven by Loews Hotel's joint venture properties at the Universal Orlando Resort. Our earnings supplement includes a definition of adjusted EBITDA.","Turning to the Parent company, net investment income was weak in Q2 2017 as results from gold related equities were down meaningfully versus the prior year as were results from other equity strategies. While our holdings of gold-related equities can be volatile from one period to another, we have under 3% of Parent company cash and investments devoted to this asset class. And over time, these investments have performed as intended within the context of the overall parent company portfolio.","As you know, we closed on the purchase of Consolidated Container Company on May 22. In the segment results on page 5 of our release, CCC's revenues for the period of our ownership are included in investment income and other. CCC's pre-tax net income are included in corporate. CCC essentially broke even during the first six weeks of our ownership as the company's income was negatively affected by deal-related expenses and the impact of purchase accounting entries. Please note that we will be disclosing in our Form 10-Q the purchase price allocation for the acquisition. We expect to show CCC as its own reporting segment beginning with our Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2017.","Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At June 30, post the funding of the CCC acquisition, the Parent company portfolio totaled $5 billion with approximately two thirds in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments.","During the second quarter, we received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, including $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk.","CNA announced this morning that it had increased its quarterly dividend from $0.25 per share to $0.30 per share, which translates into an incremental $12 million per quarter to Loews. This dividend hike is yet further evidence of CNA's rock solid capital position and its improving operating performance.","I will now hand the call back to Jim.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Thank you, David. Man, oh man, I lost my pages, here we go. Thank you, David.","Before we turn the call over to Mary, I want to bring up a question that I think is top of mind for most of you; namely, why hasn't Loews bought back more shares considering that the sum of the parts discount is the highest it's been in a number of years.","As I'm sure you know, we are well aware of Loews' sum of the parts valuation. In fact, it's something that I track constantly. Judging by the increase in our stock price over the past nine months, it certainly seems that we should have been more active repurchasing our stock. What's held us back is that while Loews almost only seems relatively cheap and even more so now, given the widening discount, the market still seems very high to us. We've been nervous about the equity market for a while and we've been struggling to reconcile our view of the market's absolute level with the relative value of Loews' stock.","As you know we take a long-term view on share repurchases. We look for opportunities to repurchase Loews' stock when both its relative and absolute values are attractive. We know that if the stock market declines, our share price will likely move in the same direction. So, given our nervousness about the stock market, we've been waiting for a time to repurchase shares at a more advantageous price. Some of you may think we may be too cautious. You may be right, only time will tell. Historically, though, we have shown that once we are comfortable buying back shares, we buy back a lot of them.","In the last two years, our buybacks may have seemed anemic, but over just the last five years we've bought back 14% of our outstanding shares at a cost of approximately $2.5 billion. Clearly, repurchasing our shares remains an important way that we allocate capital to create shareholder value.","And now, I'd like to hand the call back to Mary.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Jim, for answering that important question from shareholders. At this time, Nicole, we'd like to hand the call back over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Bob Glasspiegel from Janney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","I'd like to pursue a little bit a few questions on CCC. I think, you said you think it's a 10% cash-on-cash return. But it sounds like purchase accounting might offset some of that. Now that you've had it in your hands for longer, any sense on the conviction on that 10% cash return and what sort of goodwill offsets might there be to that?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So, we've owned it now for approximately two months, and it's performing basically exactly the way we had expected it to. When I talked about the potential for double-digit cash-on-cash returns on our investment, that is just what it says. Cash-on-cash, so it doesn't include any factoring in of goodwill, nor of depreciation. And, as I said, in our first two months of ownership we have nothing to disabuse us of our notion that it's going to be a good cash generator for Loews.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Bob, I'd also note that the purchase accounting and certain of the purchase accounting entries in the six weeks of the second quarter really related only to the six weeks of the second quarter. There will, of course, be ongoing purchase accounting given the accounting, but these were sort of one-time setup sort of purchase accounting entries.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","I was using $600 million for the equity investment or is there further disclosure somewhere?","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Yes.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","That's correct.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Are you going to disclose it in the Q.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","No, no, I'm sorry, it's correct that our equity investment was approximately $600 million.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Yes.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Yes, that will be disclosed.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","In the Q, okay.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Yes.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","And now that you don't do the sort of parent rollup, I have to bother you with a couple other questions. Hotel carrying value?","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","I'm going to have to get back to you on that.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","You're talking about net book value?","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Yes, equity. Yes, carrying value, yes. So it'd be great if you could like somehow put that in the supplement or in some other source now that it's no longer in the 10-Qs, your divisional carrying values.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Okay.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","And what was the gold losses either absolute or year-over-year?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Yes, in the context of the portfolio, it wasn't big, but there were some losses in the quarter. Gold prices went down during the quarter. But let's keep it all in perspective. Gold is not a big factor in our portfolio. And what we have is a portfolio. So, we have a number of hedge funds, we have a few hundred million dollars in equities, and it just so happened that for the quarter, the hedge fund didn't perform particularly well. Gold was down and the equities that we had didn't perform particularly well.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","I was just curious, I'm trying to get to what the run rate for corporate is, recognizing there's volatility in investment returns prospectively, but...","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","The run rate is that we've got I think about $1 billion of hedge funds, we have like $150 million of gold-related securities, and we have a few hundred million dollars of equities.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","The real change in the quarter, Bob, was just the fact that in the second quarter of last year, gold had extraordinary returns, and in this year's second quarter, as Jim described, gold declined in the quarter. So it was really the year-over-year change that's more remarkable than the absolute return.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. You gave me enough information that I can be a little bit dangerous in my modeling. Thank you.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Millman from Millman Research.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Thank you. So as I guess recent publicity about some huge number of uncompleted wells in the U.S., as one article indicated, there is huge underground storage. With that kind of news, is that accelerating any dumping of drilling equipment? You've always said the time to be optimistic is when you start to see equipment being dumped. And then I have another question.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So drilled but uncompleted wells, otherwise known as DUCs, I am not exactly sure what's been happening to that number. I haven't followed it recently. What we do know is that shale oil production is up rather significantly in the past year. And the general forecast is that U.S. shale oil production can increase by about 1 million barrels per day every year. The question is for how many years will U.S. shale production be able to increase at that rate. And the other question is, what's going to happen to worldwide oil consumption. And most importantly, in my mind, what's going to happen to worldwide oil depletion.","Our guess is that the underinvestment in oil exploration and production over the past three years is going to start to take its toll as projects that were completed before that period start to come online and start to deplete. And it's our view that in the coming years there will be a significant need for the offshore oil that has provided up to 30% of the worldwide oil supply. So I would say that we feel that right now, even though you didn't ask about it, we feel that right now we're bouncing along at the bottom with respect to offshore oil drilling. But we believe that there are, as I said, a few greenshoots, and we think that in the coming months and years, there will be more.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","So are you suggesting that we shouldn't expect to see this historic \u2013 what has been historic kind of dumping at the bottom \u2013 dumping of equipment at the bottom?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","I'm not exactly sure what you mean by dumping of equipment. Are you talking about offshore drilling equipment?","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Yes.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So, yes, there has been significant scrapping of certain offshore drilling equipment. That's equipment that's generally third- and fourth-generation rigs where there has been an assessment by the individual owners that those rigs it is not worthwhile for them to store those rigs with a hope and expectation that in a number of years they will be able to come back into the market. There is general agreement that there are more than enough fifth- and sixth-generation rigs in order to satisfy the future demand for drilling assets over the coming five years.","So I think that it's very possible that some of that scrapping will continue. But I think the important thing to look at is not the scrapping but rather what percent of the fleet is operating and how much of the fifth- and sixth-generation fleets are stacked, and what would be the cost to be able to bring those rigs out of the stack mode when, as, and if the demand increases.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Okay. And then just kind of a follow up on your share repurchase. As analyst talking to investors and trying to convince them to buy Loews, it's difficult to do that when the company is saying, gee, it's not a good time, because we think it's possible the stock is going to go down with the market. So maybe you could sort of help us out on how do we approach this?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So let me just mention a few things. Number one, we think about absolute value versus relative value. I don't think that Loews in any way is overpriced versus the stock market. But the stock market trading at 17x, 18x, or 19x earnings, the fact that interest rates are still as low as they are when we're seeing economic growth of 2.5%. The fact that there's a lot of complacency in all markets, not just the equity markets, leads me, and I'm pleased to say a significant number of other market commentators, to the view that this complacency that we're seeing in the markets can lead to a decline in equity values.","When most investors buy Loews' shares, if they change their mind, if they get nervous about the market, they can turn around and sell those shares. When the company buys in the shares, we buy them forever. And so what we are trying to do when we buy our shares is to buy them at the cheapest price we can purchase them at. I understand there are a lot of companies that repurchase their shares, they do it according to a program, and they know every quarter they've budgeted so and so many dollars to buy in their shares.","That's not the way we roll. I will stand firmly behind, and I am proud of, our repurchase record that goes back to the 1970s, that we've bought shares at attractive prices over that time period, and in that time period, have probably retired in excess of 75% of our then outstanding shares. So, yes, it is possible that I'm being a bit stubborn that the market is going to go up from here, but we've got to do what we think is right for all the shareholders. And our guess, at this point in time is, as it has been, not to spend our corporate cash on share repurchases. That can change at any point in time without any notice to shareholders, but it's how we come out after assessing all the factors that we consider.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. I hate to keep hitting this horse, but maybe you can explain a few things to us. So you spoke about...","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","The horse is already dead.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Well, thank goodness Loews isn't. So that's what we're talking about here. And if we think about the idea of a 10% cash-on-cash return at Consolidated Container versus repurchasing your own shares, those are two different kinds of investment decisions. But as a good investment manager, you're supposed to be able to explain why one makes more sense than the other. Is a 10% cash-on-cash return better than you can do by buying your own shares and would you do that to kind of trade over and over again? And if that's the case, why buy any shares of those back? Why not be doing bolt-ons for CCC?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Listen, first of all, buying CCC did not in any way hinder our ability to repurchase shares. Even after the CCC acquisitions, we had $5 billion in cash and investments. With respect to bolt-on acquisitions, CCC is ready, willing, and able to do it. They're looking around, they're waiting for the right deal at the right price, and doing bolt-ons is not like buying shares of stock. It's not there is something to do every day. You have to wait for the right opportunity and then seize it. And I promise you that CCC is looking for those opportunities. We discussed it with management, and we have complete confidence in management's ability to over time find the right bolt-on acquisitions for CCC.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And with Loews's loan CCC the money to do bolt-ons or would it purchase those bolt-ons on their behalf?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","We haven't fully thought about it. It depends how big the acquisition might be. If it's not too big, certainly CCC can afford it itself. So there are a lot of different factors that will go into it.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","The way we've structured CCC post the acquisition is they have balance sheet capacity to do bolt-on acquisitions up to a point, of course, but a number of them.","Josh D.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mary Skafidas, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Paula, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to Loews Corporation's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of our earnings release may be found on our website, loews.com. In the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, Peter Keegan. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward-looking in nature. Actual results received by the company may differ materially from those projections made in any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they were made, and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is only a brief summary of the corporation's statutory forward-looking statements disclaimers, which is included in the company's filings with the SEC.","During the call today, we might also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our security filings for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.","Now I will turn the call over to Loews' Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch.","James S. Tisch","Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss Loews' first quarter results. Overall, our first quarter financial results were solid. As you know by now, we reported earnings per share of $0.92 for the quarter, which matched the $0.92 per share that Loews earned in the first quarter of 2011. Our book value per share at quarter end was $48.96 a share, a 3.4% increase over our book value per share at year end. Underlying these financial results are the actions being taken by each of our subsidiaries to set value-creating strategies and to achieve operational excellence. Let's take a closer look at each of our subsidiaries beginning with CNA.","Under Tom Motamed, CNA continues to improve its core P&C operations, which included specialty insurance and commercial insurance businesses. The CNA team is executing strategies to achieve the dual goals of growth and underwriting profitability. Adjusting for the sale of its 50% stake in First Insurance Company of Hawaii during the fourth quarter of 2011, CNA achieved growth in net premiums written in its P&C operations of 5%. This strong growth came from 3 main factors: strong retention of existing business; healthy rate increases on retained business; and attractive new business in targeted areas.","By way of example, during the first quarter, CNA specialty and CNA commercial increased rates by 3% and 5%, respectively, with certain sub-lines of business showing much stronger rate achievement. Additionally, the ratio of new to lost business is 1.4:1. What this means is that CNA's underwriting and marketing efforts are gaining traction.","CNA's 68.8% first quarter loss ratio before the impact of catastrophes in prior year development was essentially in line with the prior-year quarter. The company's objective is to reduce its loss ratio materially from here. Rate increases, combined with improved underwriting discipline, are the keys to achieving this objective.","Finally, CNA took a major step in March when it reached agreement to acquire Hardy Underwriting for $227 million. Hardy is a specialized Lloyd underwriter with a respected market reputation and a long history of disciplined underwriting. The proposed acquisition will provide CNA with a key platform for international growth. Hardy shareholders approved this transaction last Thursday, and it's expected to close by the end of the second quarter.","Turning to Diamond Offshore in the offshore drilling market. Diamond had a good first quarter, despite net income being down 26% year-over-year. Diamond's quarterly earnings can vary meaningfully, as a result of such factors as survey downtime, rigs coming off contract and the cost associated with moving rigs from one locale to another.","As we've discussed previously, Diamond continues its program of fleet renewal and has 3 ultra-deepwater drillships and one moored semisubmersible rig under construction. Two of the drillships are already contracted to begin working for Anadarko Petroleum at attractive day rates. The other 2 units are currently being marketed and should be able to benefit from the prevailing robust day rate environment. These 4 units are in addition to the 2 ultra-deepwater semis that Diamond purchased out of bankruptcy in early '09 and the 4 semis that were upgraded to ultra-deepwater status since '02. We're encouraged about Diamond's market position and the future of the offshore drilling business.","Turning to Boardwalk Pipeline. During this past quarter, Boardwalk purchased from Loews for $285 million the 80% equity interest in Boardwalk HP Storage that Loews had acquired to support Boardwalk's purchase of those storage assets in December. As we previously said, our intention was always to drop down our 80% stake when it made financial sense for Boardwalk to purchase it. This transaction worked just as planned and ultimately benefited both Boardwalk and Loews shareholders. Boardwalk continues to pursue projects like Boardwalk HP Storage that leverage Boardwalk's core assets, diversify its services and geographic footprint and generate growth. HP Storage is a great example of that strategy in action.","Another example is the Eagle Ford expansion project. Boardwalk announced in February that it had executed a long-term fee-based gathering and processing agreement with Statoil and Talisman for approximately half of the processing plants capacity. Boardwalk's construction of the gathering lines and processing plants are continuing on schedule.","We don't typically spend much time on these calls discussing Loews Hotels, but hopefully, that will change in the quarters and the years ahead. Paul Whetsell, who joined Loews Hotels as President and CEO in January, has hit the ground running. Paul and the Loews Hotels team are sharpening their focus on growing in key urban and resort markets while, at the same time, improving the performance and profitability of our existing properties. Renovations are either underway or imminent at several of our current hotels, and growth opportunities are being continually reviewed. As with all of our subsidiaries, our goal at Loews Hotels is to create long-term value for all Loews' shareholders.","Finally, let me turn to HighMount E&P. Quite simply, low natural gas prices make life difficult for HighMount, as the company is predominantly a producer of natural gas. Last Friday, the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas settled at $2.06 per Mcf, the equivalent of oil selling for less than $12.50 a barrel.","The good news is that HighMount is not standing still. Instead, it is responding to this unprecedented environment by taking a number of steps, including materially scaling back dry gas development activity in the Permian Basin, focusing development in the Permian Basin on gas-rich wells with high liquid yield and oil potential, specifically in the Wolfcamp strata, and also acquiring and developing a core position in the Mississippian line that we believe will be profitable -- a profitable oil development opportunity for HighMount. HighMount is in the early stages of scaling up its efforts to produce more oil and liquids, so current production is still dominated by dry gas, but we\u2019re encouraged by management's efforts to pursue projects that have the prospect of generating higher returns in the current environment.","HighMount recorded a non-cash ceiling test impairment charge of $28 million after taxes in the first quarter related to its carrying value of natural gas and oil properties. This non-cash accounting charge was a result of declines in natural gas prices. If prices remain unchanged through 2012 and holding all other assumptions constant, HighMount will incur non-cash after-tax ceiling test impairments that could range from approximately $400 million to $450 million for the full year of 2012, inclusive of the first quarter impairment.","As you know, ceiling test impairment charges are mandated by GAAP, not because gas is no longer in the ground, but simply because the accounting rules require us to value all of our reserves at current prices.","Before I turn the call over to Pete, I want to take a few moments to comment on natural gas in the face of today's historically low prices. When putting today's natural gas price environment into context, I'd like to remind myself of what I call the second rule of economics, which is what has to happen, happens. Currently, gas prices are unsustainably low due to the combination of an extraordinarily warm winter and the over production of shale gas. It is simply not economically viable today to drill a well for dry gas at a $2 per Mcf price. Like it or not, with natural gas prices this low, gas production will slow down and demand will increase. Eventually, we will arrive at an equilibrium price of natural gas, which I estimate to be at about $4.50 per Mcf, which is the BTU equivalent of $27 per barrel of oil, still a veritable bargain.","At that $4.50 price, the United States can and will dramatically increase its production of natural gas. And at that price, there will still be an enormous incentive for consumption of natural gas to increase significantly. In fact, this is already happening. Diesel fuel consumers are currently making the capital investments necessary to switch to natural gas, often with a 2-year payback on their investments. Not only will truckers and railroads convert to natural gas, but HighMount too is seriously analyzing the option of converting its drilling operation in the oil patch to natural gas from diesel.","Due to improvements in frac-ing technology, which have unlocked enormous amounts of gas shale hydrocarbon, the United States has a virtually unlimited supply of natural gas. This new abundant source of energy can, and will, in the next decade transform our economy. With supply assured and prices low, natural gas consumption will certainly continue to increase. Power generation, transportation, industrial production and L&G exports from the U.S. should all combine to material enhance -- materially enhance gas demand. So while the U.S. may be in for a few more years of unnaturally low gas prices, I'm of the belief that over the medium to long term, the most fundamental precept of economics, which is that relative prices drive demand, will result in higher natural gas prices and a more favorable pricing environment for HighMount.","Now back to the business at hand, let me turn the call over to Pete for more details on the first quarter.","Peter W. Keegan","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $367 million or $0.92 per share for the first quarter of 2012 as compared to $379 million or $0.92 per share in the first quarter of 2011. The slight decrease in the first quarter was due to lower earnings at HighMount and Diamond Offshore. These decreases were offset partially by higher earnings at CNA and increased investment income at the holding company. CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the first quarter was $226 million as compared to $199 million in 2011. The increase was due to lower catastrophe losses in increased investment income, especially in limited partnership results.","Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the first quarter 2012 was $87 million compared to $117 million in the prior-year quarter. Results for the first quarter were impacted by lower utilization, including planned downtime, the impact of lower day rates from contract rollovers on 5 rigs and higher rig downtime for mobilization, prepping and stacking. Additionally, there were higher contract drilling expenses reflecting the higher costs of operating rigs internationally rather than domestically.","Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the first quarter increased to $35 million from $33 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase in net income was partially the result of the acquisition of HP Storage and lower interest expense, which was modestly offset by the continuing decline in natural gas prices and lower throughput primarily from mild winter weather.","As Jim mentioned, HighMount recorded a net loss of $22 million for the first quarter of 2012 compared to net income of $19 million in the first quarter 2011. The lower results were due to a non-cash cost center ceiling test impairment charge of $28 million after taxes related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties, as well as decreased sales volumes stemming from a reduction in drilling activity and declines in natural gas prices.","HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the first quarter are as follows: Natural gas production was 10.3 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $4.22 per 1,000 cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 633,000 barrels at an average realized price of $39.79 per barrel; and oil production was 81,000 barrels at an average price of $95 per barrel. HighMount has hedges in place as of March 31, 2012, that cover approximately 51% of projected equivalent production. Natural gas hedges totaled 22.9 billion cubic feet at $5.30 per MMBTU. Natural gas liquid hedges total 1,848,000 [ph] barrels at $37.33 per barrel, and crude oil hedges total 198,000 barrels at $102.59 per barrel.","At Loews Hotels, net income increased $2 million for the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to equity earnings in joint venture properties as compared to the 2011 period. Revenues per available room increased $3.24 to $155.31 for the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the 2011 period. The increase in revenue per available room reflects improving occupancy and average room rates.","Holding company cash investments as of March 31, 2012, totaled $3.7 billion as compared to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2011. We received $170 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries and paid $25 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the first quarter of 2012. Additionally, we received $285 million from Boardwalk Pipeline from the sale of our 80% interest in HP Storage. We also bought back 2,500 shares of Loews common stock for $96,000. ","I'll now turn the call back over to the Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Pete, and thank you, Jim. Paula, we're ready for our Q&A session of the call. Could you please give participants instructions for asking questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bob Glasspiegel of Langen McAlenney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Is your carrying value for HighMount $2 billion now after the write-down?","James S. Tisch","Pete's looking that up.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. Second is booking [ph] question, the -- how do we get from what Boardwalk reports to what you report? The $285 million, which I guess was assumed that they had it for all 3 months on their books, was there any sort of implied interest that goes to Loews? Or is this just that it never happened for the quarter? I'm just wondering how that sidecar earnings went through the numbers.","Peter W. Keegan","We did not pick up any interest from that expense. We just picked up earnings during the period in which we held it.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","But based on their books, they owned it for the whole quarter, I think they said.","Peter W. Keegan","Right, they used purchase accounting, which pushed it back to January 1. And obviously, whatever duplication there is, is illuminated in consolidation.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","So how do we get from what they -- just roughly, how do we get from what the earnings they reported...","Peter W. Keegan","You're talking about a very minor adjustment, Bob. Just -- I mean, just take their numbers. It's not a big deal.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. When the hedges run out for HighMount, is it sort of roughly a breakeven operation to you on a reported basis? Or what's the rough earnings power?","James S. Tisch","I'm not exactly sure. I\u2019ll have to get back to you on that.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","I guess the question is does it make money or lose money is the question.","James S. Tisch","Let me put it to you this way. It does not make sense for us to drill for natural gas at $2 an Mcf. And in fact, we are not drilling in the Permian Basin for dry gas, nor are we drilling anywhere for dry gas. The only drilling that is going on now is looking for wet gas and also oil.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Got you on that. I\u2019m just -- for modeling purposes, I just want to know how we think about this unit looking out to next year.","Peter W. Keegan","To answer your question, at the end of the first quarter, HighMount's total assets were $2.8 billion.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","I was actually looking for carrying value, which I think is around $2 billion.","Peter W. Keegan","Well, our equity is $2 billion. The equity is $2 billion.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jim, are you -- will you make any comment about the pacing of share repurchases looking backwards, over, say, the last 6 months? They've been pretty modest.","James S. Tisch","I'm not -- as you know, I'm not going to comment on that.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, at HighMount, will these non-cash impairments be reversed if natural gas prices were substantially higher?","James S. Tisch","No. But what will happen is the amortization that we will have going forward on gas that's produced will be lower. So in essence, it will come back invisibly into earnings over time as the gas is produced.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Baker of Barclays.","Andrew Baker","Couple of questions, Jim. You were talking about the increase in demand and decrease in supply of natural gas hitting equilibrium. Is that a 2013 event, do you think? Is that earlier, later? How should we think about when that sort of -- should sort of kick in?","James S. Tisch","It's a process that will occur over a number of years. And it's a process, first of all, because in terms of demand for natural gas, it will take time for people to make the capital equipment changes that they need to make in order to be able to consume natural gas in trucks and trains and even in the oil patch. And likewise, for supply of natural gas, my guess is that there is still some small amount of drilling that's going on for dry gas. There are a lot of reasons for that, such as people trying to hold property by production and the like. But over time, if gas prices stay down here, my guess is that a lot of that gas -- a lot of that drilling will stop. We've seen, for example, over the past few weeks a number of producers in the Haynesville say that they are going -- they're laying down their rigs, and they're not going to start to drill for dry gas there again until prices get to somewhere between $4 and $4.50 per Mcf. The Haynesville, going back a year or 2, was one of the most prolific and the most profitable areas to produce natural gas. So we are seeing, in terms of producer plans to drill for dry gas, that they are no longer drilling or they're planning not to drill, and they're going to wait a good long time until prices get back to reasonable levels so they can earn a rate of return on their investment. Now that's different in drilling for wet gas. With wet gas, not only do you get natural gas, dry natural gas, but you also get natural gas liquids. And natural gas liquids, to a large extent, are priced off of oil. So oftentimes, people can drill for wet gas, which can represent 30% or 40% of the BTUs produced, but since the wet gas, propane -- since the wet gas constituents, the liquids, propane, butane, isobutane, natural gasoline and a few others, since those are priced off of oil, then in essence, the producer doesn't really care so much about the price of natural gas because the price of the liquids so dramatically outweighs the value of the natural gas that's being produced.","Andrew Baker","So then given your sort of long-term view in general and your tremendous pool of capital, does it make sense for you to go out there and take dry gas reserves off peoples\u2019 hands with a 5-year time horizon from those people who may only have a 1-year time horizon?","James S. Tisch","We\u2019re always looking, but the problem is that they are not stupid in the market. If you look at the forward price for natural gas in the futures market, that anticipates that -- it anticipates that the recovery is going to come back to natural gas prices over the next 2 or 3 years. So my prediction of $4.50 natural gas prices is not substantially different from the futures market. And the people that are actually selling properties today are able to sell on the basis of the forward price for natural gas, not the spot prices. So to date, we haven't found any veritable bargains.","Andrew Baker","Even though the forward has been proven incorrect so far?","James S. Tisch","That's right. This year is going to be a little different though, I think, because, come the end of October, or even before the end of October, the storage facilities in the United States may be full. And so production will have to decline to meet that end of storage season, and prices will have to decline. But after that, it's unclear what will happen to prices. It's possible that production will have -- goes down enough that prices could start to accelerate meaningfully.","Andrew Baker","And one last question. Given the S&P is back to 1,400 and the interest rates are still low, can you give us your thoughts on how you think about investing the $3.7 billion of corporate cash?","James S. Tisch","Yes, we really haven't changed too much. We have like $500 million or $600 million of equities and a slightly greater amount of limited partnership investment, and then beyond that, we\u2019re fixed income and treasury bills.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sam Yake of BGB Securities.","Sam Yake - BGB Securities, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering on -- you made some comments about your hotels segment, which is kind of small, and you haven't talked much about it in recent years. I'm just wondering, what are your thoughts on potentially creating like a REIT structure, kind of like what you did with Boardwalk and then creating a vehicle for the hotel business?","James S. Tisch","Right now, we don't have any plans for that. Right now, we are interested in growing our hotel business in what we would call an asset-like manner. And we understand that to do that may require bridge financing from Loews similar to the bridge financing that we've provided to Boardwalk for their acquisition earlier this year. But we are looking at a number of different opportunities, and we're hopeful that over the coming years, that our hotel business can grow.","Sam Yake - BGB Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned you have $3.7 billion of holding company cash. What's kind of like the minimum amount you'd want to have?","James S. Tisch","We have -- well, first, we have $3.7 billion of holding company cash and investments. And historically, that cash balance has not gone below $1.5 billion or $2 billion.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research Associates.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","On the hotel business, are you talking about or looking into doing management and\/or franchising out the brand?","James S. Tisch","We are not looking to franchise the brand. We have historically done hotel management. We have a number of hotels under management, and we're looking to continue doing that, as well as take equity investments in hotels.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Okay. And regarding gas, what's the breakeven for drilling for shale-related gas?","James S. Tisch","You mean dry gas?","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","For dry gas. Is that...","James S. Tisch","Well, the -- I mentioned, for example, the Haynesville that producers are saying that they're not going to start drilling again until they get to $4 to $4.50 natural gas prices. That's just one particular area. But it's -- some shales are a bit higher, some shales are a bit lower, but that's approximately where a producer can earn a reasonable rate of return on his investment. Now a lot will be driven by the cost of drilling services and tracking services, and that can be move dramatically over time, so when I say $4 to $4.50, we're really talking about a moving target.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","That's what I was trying to get to a little bit more. And regarding the share repurchase, can you mention whether you had any blackout periods during the last couple of quarters?","James S. Tisch","No. No, I'm not going to mention whether we had any blackout periods.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.

Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session with question committed by shareholders.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward-looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those made or implied in any forward-looking statements due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings.

Please refer to our security filings and earnings supplement for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures. In a few minutes, our CFO, David Edelson will walk you through key drivers for the quarter. Before he does, Jim Tisch, our CEO, will kick off the call.","Jim, over to you.","Jim Tisch","Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Before we get into the details of the quarter and our year end results, I want to mention share repurchases. For those of you who follow Loews closely, I must sound like a broken record. I've been saying for a while that we believe Loews\u2019 stock looks cheap and trades at a deep discount to our view of its intrinsic value. Rather than complain, we have acted.","From January 1st of 2018 through Friday, we repurchased more than 45 million shares of Loews\u2019 common stock for total cost of just under $2.25 billion. That represents more than 15% of our currently outstanding shares. Typically, most of the funds we\u2019ve used to repurchase our shares have come from dividends paid to Loews from our subsidiaries. And in recent years, most of those dividends have come from CNA. However, dividends paid to Loews represent only a portion of the free cash flows generated by our subsidiaries.","Our businesses may also decide to use their free cash flow, either to fund growth or to pay down debt. And to the extent that they have the opportunity to profitably reinvest their cash flow into their businesses, we encourage them to do so. However, if there is no other productive use for their free cash flow, more often than not, they'll distribute that cash.","To pull back the curtain a bit on this process, in 2019, Loews received more than $180 million from Loews hotels. This cash came both from the sale of hotels and free cash flow from operations, both after Loews hotels invested around $70 million into construction of new properties, we expect Loews hotels to return capital again in 2020 but the amount will likely be smaller because the hotel companies will continue to invest in its own development and we expect fewer proceeds from the sale of hotel properties. No matter what, to the extent that the hotel company has economically attractive projects in which to invest, we want them to do so.","This year, we have three new hotels opening in St. Louis, Orlando and Kansas City. These hotels represent more than 3,000 new keys for our company. These properties will either be focused on transients and group business like the new Loews Kansas City, which is attached to the Kansas City Convention Center, or they will have built-in demand generators like the Endless Summer Hotel in Orlando.","Additionally, in late December of 2019, most hotels received the necessary approvals from the Arlington Texas City Council to build $550 million 888 room hotel that will be connected to a new Convention Center. The Arlington Convention Center complex, which will be at the base of AT&T Stadium and Globe Life Field will offer 216,000 square feet of meeting and outdoor function space. As part of an overall effort by the city to increase convention and tourism business in Arlington, which is nestled between Dallas and Fort Worth and 15 minutes from the DFW Airport.","Since 2013, Loews hotels have more than tripled its adjusted EBITDA, going from $68 million back then to $227 million last year. We believe the company's future is bright and that it will be a strong growth engine for the parent company. In other subsidiary news, those of you who look at our earnings supplement may notice that CCC, our packaging subsidiary recently changed its name to Altium. The rationale for the change is that CCC had been well known with the industry as the water and milk container company, but their product lines and capabilities are much broader.","With Altium\u2019s recent acquisitions, the company has expanded even further the number of segments of the packaging industry it can service. The new name is meant to underscore the company's diverse capabilities and help to continue to grow its customer base.","Before turning the call over to David, I want to briefly talk about our results for 2019. Loews had a good year driven by stellar results at CNA, as well as good investment income at the parent company level. CNA\u2019s underlying combined ratio continue to improve in 2019 despite a competitive environment. In 2016, CNA\u2019s underlying combined ratio improved by more than three points. Additionally, CNA grew net written premiums by 5% for 2019, driven by particularly strong growth in commercial lines, rate increased 5% for CNA\u2019s and P&C operation last year. It goes without saying that we remain very bullish on CAN, both on the fundamentals of the insurance industry and on CAN\u2019s growth trajectory within the industry.","CNA will continue to focus on maintaining and improving its strong underwriting culture and building on its expertise in areas of deep specialization. These steps will help CNA reach its goal of sustaining top quartile underwriting performance. CNA represents a significant portion of Loews\u2019 some of the parts and as such, our lead purchases underscore our confidence in our insurance business.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David.","David Edelson","Thank you, Jim and good morning. Today, we reported fourth quarter net income of $217 million or $0.73 per share compared to a net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we reported net income of $932 million or $3.07 per share, up from $636 million or $1.99 per share in 2018.","I will start by summarizing our much improved fourth quarter results, and then turn to the full year. The earnings turnaround in Q4 was driven mainly by investment results at both CNA and the parent company, as well as higher P&C underwriting income at CNA. CNA's net income contribution swung from the $75 million loss in Q4 2018 to income of $244 million, an improvement of $319 million.","Returns on CNA's holdings of LPs and common stocks accounted for $146 million of the improvement, and a pivot from net investment losses to net investment gains accounted for another $61 million. P&C underwriting income at CNA accounted for $119 million of our year-over-year net income increase, driven by lower cat losses and stronger underlying underwriting results. CNA's overall combined ratio declined almost 10 points from Q4 2018 to 95.6, and its underlying combined ratio, which excludes cats and prior year development, improved 3.1 points to 94.9.","Like CAN, Loews parent company investment results benefited from more favorable equity market conditions, as they swung from the $57 million after-tax loss to income of $67 million in Q4. Loews Hotels and CNA's corporate segment were the main year-over-year negatives. Loews Hotels incurred a $69 million after-tax charge from the impairment of two hotel properties in Q4. Absent this charge and other nonrecurring items, such as pre-opening expenses and properties under development, Loews Hotels\u2019 contribution to our net income would have been up around 20%, as operating results continued to be robust.","CNA booked a $48 million after-tax charge in Q4 related to its legacy asbestos and environmental pollution reserves, which reduced our net income by $43 million. In last year's fourth quarter, CNA incurred a net retroactive reinsurance charge that reduced our net income by $24 million. As a reminder, in 2010, CNA exceeded substantially all its legacy asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities to national indemnity, pursuant to a loss portfolio transfer.","Before turning to the full, one year one last observation on the quarter. Average shares outstanding declined about 6% from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting our ongoing share repurchase activity. Now for our full year results, we reported net income of $932 million, up 47% over 2018. CNA, Boardwalk and the parent company investment portfolio, drove the increase with Diamond and Loews Hotels posting year-over-year declines.","Let me start with CNA whose net income contribution rose 23% in 2019 to $894 million, as CNA itself, posted net income of $1 billion. Favorable investment performance propelled the increase. Net investment income rose, thanks to LPs and common stock investments, while net investment gains swung from losses in 2018 to gains in 2019. The swing in net investment gains was dominated by the change in market value of CNA's holdings of non redeemable preferred stock.","P&C underwriting income was essentially flat year-over-year as better underlying underwriting income and lower catastrophe losses were offset by lower level of favorable net prior development in 2019 than in the prior year. For the year, CNA posted an underlying combined ratio of 94.8, marking its third consecutive year of improvement. This result included an underline loss ratio of 61. While CNA has already made great strides in enhancing its underwriting profitability, it remains laser focused on further reducing both its loss and expense ratios.","The long-term care reserve charge taken in the third quarter was the main detractor from CNA's 2019 results. During 2019, CNA unlocked and strengthened its long-term care active life reserves and action it hadn't taken since year-end 2015. This charge reduced Loews' net income by $151 million. When factoring in long-term care claims reserve releases in both years, however, LTC reserve actions accounted for $133 million year-over-year reduction in CNA's contribution to our net income.","The bottom line is this, CNA's balance sheet is strong, its underwriting performance continues to improve with opportunities for further premium growth and combined ratio reduction. And its long-term care business continues to be aggressively and prudently managed to reduce risk and improve results.","Boardwalk also had a good year as reflected by the significant increases in ts contribution to our pre-tax and net income. Since the increase in net income contribution is due in large part to increasing our ownership from 51% to 100% in July of 2018, I will focus my comments on pre-tax income.","Pre-tax income was up $50 million in 2019 to $281 million as revenues generated by growth projects more than offset net revenue losses from contract restructurings, expirations and renewals. Also, about half of the year-over-year increase was from proceeds received when a customer filed for bankruptcy.","The parent company portfolio of cash and investments was the final driver of our year-over-year improvement. This portfolio generated $188 million of after tax income in 2019 versus an $8 million loss in 2018. The beat was almost entirely attributable to returns on equity holdings. The parent company portfolio of cash and investments averaged $3.9 billion in 2018 and $3.4 billion in 2019.","On the flip side, Diamond and Loews hotels, both showed year-to-year income declines. Diamond had a tough year with its pre-tax loss growing from $226 million in 2018 to $402 million in 2019. Diamond\u2019s 2019 can be summarized by two statistics, revenue earning days up 4% but average daily rate down 17%. As a result, contract drilling revenues were down 12% and contract drilling margin declined from 32% to 15%. Contract drilling expenses were up almost 10%, largely due to the mix of rigs working in 2019 versus 2018, as well as the accelerated amortization of contract preparation costs on several rigs.","In 2019, Diamond invested approximately $325 million in its fleet to ensure its raise continue to be considered top tier by customers. The company expects significantly reduced capital spending in 2020. Diamond ended the year with an undrawn revolver of almost $1.2 billion. Revolver capacity will decline to $950 million later this year. Loews hotels had a strong year operationally, but its contribution to our reported income was impacted by impairment charges and non-recurring pre-opening expenses.","The company reported an annual net loss of $31 million versus net income last year of $48 million. Excluding impairments and other nonrecurring items, Loews hotels\u2019 net income increased 8% from $49 million to $53 million. Loews hotels\u2019 adjusted EBITDA, which is defined and disclosed in our quarterly earnings supplement, was essentially flat from 2018 to 2019 at $227 million. However, when properties that Loews hotels\u2019 no longer owns are excluded in both years, adjusted EBITDA was up about 2%.","Turning to the parent company. We continue to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year end, the parent company portfolio totaled $3.3 billion with 77% in cash and equivalents and 22% in LP investments and marketable equity securities. During the fourth quarter, we received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $85 million from CNA and $25 million from Boardwalk.","For the full year, we received total dividends of $927 million from CNA and Boardwalk with CNA contributing $825 million of that amount. Today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend and an increased regular quarterly dividend of $0.37. Combining the two, Loews will receive $575 million in dividends from CNA this quarter.","Please note that since Boardwalk is now wholly owned, it will no longer pay Loews a fixed quarterly dividend and will likely pay an annual dividend toward the end of the year. We currently expect Boardwalk\u2019s dividend to Loews in 2020 to approximate 2019\u2019s $100 million. I would highlight that we have worked diligently over the past couple of years to streamline the parent company.","Net corporate operating expenses, which include investment expenses, now netted against investment income and exclude corporate interest expense, dropped about 20% from 2018 to 2019. While some of this decrease relates to slightly higher allocations to our subsidiaries, much of it relates to parent company efficiencies. We repurchased 8.3 million shares in the fourth quarter for $417 million and 21.5 million shares during all of 2019 for $1 billion. Since year end, we have repurchased an additional 3.3 million shares for a total of $172 million.","I will now hand the call back to Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, David. We'd like to move to our question and answer portion of the call. Laurie, would you please take us through the prompt?","Operator","Question-and-Answer Session","[Operator Instructions]","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Laurie. Our first question is why doesn't Loews purchase the outstanding public shares of CNA? What is the benefit of maintaining CNA as a public company?","Jim Tisch","So right now, we believe that the public floating CNA while small is very important for a number of reasons. First of all, it provides transparency. Transparency for credit agencies and regulators, which I think they value very much and they like seeing a public start for CNA. Number two, it's a barometer for all Loews shareholders just what the market is valuing CNA. And I dare say if CNA went public, then a lot of people would be asking why don't we take it public so that they can actually see what the value of CNA is in the free market.","Additionally, in order to attract the best talent, it's important to have public shares so that it can be, those shares can be used for employee compensation plans. And I dare say if CNA weren't public, if we didn't have those shares directly reflecting the value of CNA it might be more difficult to attract the best and the top talent.","One other thing that I'd add is that as long as Loews owns over 80% of CNA, and right now it owns close to 90%. But as long as we own over 80%, we can do a tax consolidation and get all the benefits of owning 100% of the stock. So there's absolutely no penalty vis-\u00e0-vis cash income taxes, resulting from Loews\u2019 owning 90% instead of 80% of the stock -- 90% I'm sorry instead of 100% of the stock.","Mary Skafidas","Jim, second question is, what has been the impact of the corona virus on Loews\u2019 hotels business?","Jim Tisch","So at this point in time, it hasn't had much of an impact at all. Yes, the virus is affecting areas like China and Asia dramatically, but we haven't seen so much of an impact here in the United States. Our hotel people are continuing to monitor the situation. In terms of inbound travel to Loews hotels from China represents less than 1% of our business. So if the status quo continues to hold, I don't see there being much effect of corona virus on our hotel business.","Mary Skafidas","Next question relates to Diamond. What's the role of Diamond in the Loews portfolio?","Jim Tisch","So Diamond may have a big impact in a GAAP sense on Loews\u2019 results. But our downside is really limited to our stake in the company, which today represents less than $1 per Loews corporation share. I would say that the current share price Diamond is really trading more like an option than it is like a stock. Regarding the offshore drilling industry in '89, knowing that it was highly cyclical when the current downturn started in '14, we thought we've seen this movie before having weathered a number of drilling cycles downside. However, this downturn now has lasted much longer than we are, I dare say anyone could have anticipated.","Nevertheless, Diamond, the management continues to focus managing its cost and maximizing earnings potential on the assets through diversification and good operating performance. One other thing, I think the bearishness in Diamond is really -- has been around just since the beginning of the year. At the end of last year, oil prices West Texas Intermediate was $61 a barrel, it traded up to $63 a barrel in early January and now as you all know it's down to $50.","And I think that move down to $50, which was due in large part to the corona virus and also a sense that the world production capacity would be a bit higher than demand this year, but not in the future. So those two factors have caused a dark bearishness to overcome the whole offshore drilling industry. I could easily foresee at some point oil prices getting back to the $60 and $65 barrel level. I think that, shale oil cannot be -- the growth will not -- in shale oil production, will not grow significant at those prices. And I ultimately say next year could see oil prices at the $65 to $70 a barrel level, which would I believe lead to significant improvement in the offshore drilling industry.","What happened now is that this is an industry-wide phenomenon. What's going on is not just accessing Diamond offshore. The low day rates are going to affect all companies and in order for day rates to improve, I think we need to see an increase in oil prices, which as I said I think is coming in as we say the fullness of time.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. We want to thank all of you for your continued interest. A replay will be available on our Web site loews.com in approximately two hours.

I'm Mary Skafidas, the Head of Investor Relations for Loews, and I'd like to welcome you all to the Loews Corporation Fourth Quarter and Year End 2011 Earnings Call [ph].","A copy of our earnings release may be found on our website, loews.com. On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and Chief Financial Officer, Pete Keegan. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call may include statements that are forward-looking in nature.

Tisch","Thank you, Mary, and welcome to the Loews Corporation and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Loews' fourth quarter and year-end results. I'll cover a few key highlights for the year, and then turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our CFO, to review our results in more detail. ","As you know by now, net income for the full year 2011 was $2.63 per share, as compared to $3.07 in the prior year. While net income was down year-over-year, it left positive developments of several of our key subsidiaries. But before I discuss our individual businesses, let's take a moment to focus on the strategic management of Loews. ","As I said before, we focus on 3 basic strategic principles, all with the goal of building long-term shareholder value. First, we constantly focus on making opportune investments and acquisitions that position us for future growth. This past year, Loews did not make any acquisitions at the holding company level. However, we did facilitate significant investments with at 2 of our subsidiaries, Boardwalk and HighMount, that should serve to greatly enhance long-term value of those companies and ultimately, Loews.","Our second basic principle is to create long-term value -- our second basic principle to create long-term value is to effectively manage and allocate Loews' capital. In that regard, in 2011, we spent $718 million buying back 18.2 million shares of Loews' common stock, an investment which we think significantly enhances value for all Loews' shareholders.","And third, we constantly work to enhance our subsidiaries' operating performance and capital structure. In 2011, Loews and our subsidiaries continue to weather the economic storm, while positioning ourselves for the future. Our subsidiaries made great progress in meeting the strategic imperative they set to make their business and operations stronger and better able to compete in any economic climate. I'm very pleased with the progress that each of our subsidiaries is making.","With respect to our subsidiaries, let's first take a look at CNA. The company continues to work towards its main strategic goals of improving the market position and profitability of the core team sea [ph] operation. CNA is focusing on underwriting and pricing discipline, seeking growth while continuing to build its balance sheet. Let me share 4 points that underscore CNA's success. ","First, CNA's positive rate increases, solid business retention and strong new business have all resulted in premium growth across the P&C businesses. Second, 2011 was the fifth consecutive year of favorable prior year P&C loss development to CNA. ","Third, CNA's book value per common share increased to $42.92 at year-end 2011, which reflects continued improvement in CNA's capital position. And lastly, CNA continued its efforts to simplify, strengthen and focus its organization. In that regard, CNA sold its 50% ownership interest in First Insurance Company of Hawaii in August and acquired in June the minority shares of CNA Surety that it did not previously own.","Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond continues to improve the capabilities of its fleet while maintaining its focus on prudent capital allocation. Diamond recently announced its plans to construct a deepwater semi-submersible rig, mainly Ocean Onyx, that is scheduled to be delivered in the third quarter of 2013. Diamond anticipates that there is significant demand from operators for new deepwater units and this rig should be ideally suited to meet that demand. ","Diamond will construct the Ocean Onyx, utilizing an existing hull of a cold stacked unit, which should allow the rig to be built and placed into service in approximately half the time and at half the cost of current new build. Longtime Diamond watchers may be saying that they've seen this movie before. I'd say I like the ending. ","The new rig, along with the 3 ultra-deepwater drill ships under construction in Korea, will be another step in accomplishing Diamond's goals of renewing and upgrading its fleet. Over the last 5 years, Diamond has ordered, built or purchased 8 units capable of operating in deep- or ultra-deepwater.","Shifting our focus to Boardwalk. The company is in full-growth mode. It is pursuing its strategy to look for projects that leverage Boardwalk's core asset and diversifies its services and geographic footprint. In the past few months, the Boardwalk management team has made significant progress on these fronts. ","Just today, the company announced an outstanding news and major projects in the liquids-rich Eagle Ford shale. Boardwalk will be building 55 miles of the gathering pipeline and the natural gas liquids processing plant. Long-term fee-based agreements are already in place with anchored tenants, Statoil and Talisman, for half of the processing plant's capacity. Boardwalk is in discussions with other producers for the remaining capacity.","As Stan Horton reviewed on the Boardwalk call earlier today, our Boardwalk has approximately $875 million of growth in acquisition opportunities, which include the Eagle Ford Shale project, the Marcellus gas gathering project and the recent acquisition of the Petal and Hattiesburg storage and pipeline assets, now called HP Storage. As you may recall, HP storage was acquired through a joint venture with an affiliate of the Loews-owned general partner. Boardwalk owns 20% of the joint venture and may acquire the remaining 80% from Loews.","Let's now shift to HighMount and the Natural Gas market. We remain optimistic about natural gas prices over the long term. But for the past 6 months, HighMount has taken steps to diversify its business. HighMount has acquired acreage believed to be rich in oil and natural gas liquids, which currently offers dramatically better economics for drilling and natural gas. ","Consistent with this strategy, in the third quarter, HighMount purchased a working interest in approximately 70,000 net acres of land in the Oklahoma, that we believe to contain oil-rich liquids. HighMount plans to begin drilling this month. In addition, HighMount is pursuing drilling programs in the Sonora field directed at geologic zones that the company anticipates will produce a higher mix of oil and liquid.","Finally, let's turn to Loews Hotels. I'd like to welcome Paul Whetsell, who has recently joined us as the new President and CEO of Loews Hotels. With more than 35 years of experience in the Hotel industry, Paul's understanding of the hospitality business is a great asset to Loews Hotels. In 1987, he founded the CapStar Hotel Company, which became one of the industry's largest hotel owners, with over 110 hotels and $3 billion in assets. Most recently, he served as a member of the Board of Directors of Virgin Hotels, providing strategic guidance for its operations and property-acquisition activity. Paul will look to grow Loews Hotels in an asset-like manner, while building on our successful formula of operating unique properties with exceptional service.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Pete Keegan.","Peter W. Keegan","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Loews today reported net income of $268 million or $0.67 per share for the fourth quarter 2011 as compared to $466 million or $1.12 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease in the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower investment income from limited partnership results of CNA and the increase to insurance reserves for CNA's payout annuity business. The fourth quarter also reflects lower earnings of Diamond Offshore.","Loews' net income for the full year was $1.1 billion or $2.63 per share compared to $1.3 billion or $3.07 per share in 2010. Book value per share for Loews increased to $47.49 at December 31, 2011, as compared to $44.51 at December 31, 2010, approximately a 7% increase.","CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the fourth quarter was $192 million as compared to $297 million in 2010 and $569 million for the full year of 2011 compared to $609 million for the prior year. The decrease was due to lower investment income from limited partnership results of $57 million and $104 million increase in insurance reserves through its payout annuity business. ","As discussed in the CNA call, the underlying core P&C business continued to show improvement in underwriting profitably and growth. CNA also continues its discipline reserving practices. In the fourth quarter, the P&C business benefited from $250 million of pre-tax favorable prior year loss development. CNA has had 20 consecutive quarters of favorable prior year reserve development.","Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $88 million compared to $113 million in the prior year quarter and $451 million for the full year 2011 as compared to $446 million from the year before. Results for the fourth quarter were impacted by a higher number of planned downtime days for scheduled maintenance, survey, mobilization and upgrades, while the full year results benefited from historically low unanticipated equipment downtime.","Boardwalk Pipeline's net income for the fourth quarter decreased to $21 million from $34 million in the prior-year quarter and $77 million for the full year in 2011 compared to $114 million from the prior year. The decrease is primarily attributable to one-time items in both 2011 and 2010. Absent those items, the quarter was basically flat year-over-year. Boardwalk recently raised $217 million in an equity offering.","HighMount's net income for the fourth quarter decreased to $12 million from $21 million in the prior year quarter and $62 million for the full year in 2011 compared to $77 million from the prior year. Results are primarily due to decreased sales volumes stemming from a reduction in HighMount's drilling activity and declines in natural gas prices. ","HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the fourth quarter are as follows: Natural gas production was $10.7 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.71 per 1,000 cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 656,000 barrels at an average realized price of $39.36 per barrel; and oil production was 72,000 barrels at an average price of $88.74 per barrel. ","HighMount has hedges in place for about 52% of its total production for 2012 at an average price of $5.79, and has hedges in place for about 16% of its total production for 2013 at an average price of $5.44. During the fourth quarter, HighMount refinanced its outstanding debt, which included a $400 million capital contribution from Loews. ","Loews Hotels had improved results for the quarter and year. Net income increased to $5 million for the fourth quarter in 2011 from breakeven in the prior year. For the full year in 2011, net income rose to $13 million as compared to $1 million for 2010. The improved results were due to the improvement of business in leisure travel with particularly strong results for Loews at the Miami Beach and Orlando Hotels. ","Holding company cash and investments as of December 31, 2011, totaled $3.3 billion as compared to $4 billion at September 30, 2011. In the fourth quarter, we made capital contributions of $400 million to HighMount for the refinancing of its term loans and $106 million to fund the acquisition of working interest in oil and gas properties. ","In addition, we invested $285 million for an 80% equity ownership in a joint venture with Boardwalk Pipeline. We received $159 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries and paid $25 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2011. We also repurchased 800,000 shares of our common stock for $28 million.","As of December 31, 2011, there were 396.6 million shares of Loews common stock outstanding. ","And that concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn the call back over to Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Thanks, Pete. Kelly, we're ready for our question-and-answer session now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Ron Bobman with Capital Returns.","Ron Bobman - Capital Returns Management","I had a CNA-related question. CNA management regularly comments in the context of capital management and potential capital management activities that an important factor in their sort of menu of choices is the float of CNA stock? And I was -- what I'd like to know is from the Loews perspective. Obviously. As the dominant shareholder, does Loews care about the float of CNA?","James S. Tisch","If CNA went public, I think that Loews shareholders would demand that it be public. And being in public offers a lot of benefits to CNA. And so we actually like the fact that it's public. It gives us a barometer on how CNA is doing and it helps all Loews shareholders to value CNA as well. Beyond that, whether the float is 10% or 5% or 20%, I don't think it's worthwhile for me to comment.","Operator","The next question comes from David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jim and Pete, well, first, were there any dynamics that limited at all the window of opportunity for Loews to buy back its common stock during the fourth quarter?","James S. Tisch","I'm not going to answer that question because I don't want to -- first of all, if there were, then maybe there were some corporate activity. And if there weren't, it just doesn't make any sense for us to go down that road and talk about the things that may or may not have prevented us from buying in shares.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Can you comment, in general, about the -- what you see in terms of the opportunity for the holding company to make acquisitions in the present environment?","James S. Tisch","Yes. I think, and I felt this way for a few years now, that the acquisitions in this environment are very difficult for a few reasons. Number one, because the future is really not clear. I don't have a clear view of whether the economy is going to grow at 2%, 4% or 0%. And there still are an enormous number of uncertainties that those of us that manage businesses have to deal with day in and day out. That's number one. And number two, there really aren't a lot of property or assets that are for sale at prices that I think would be attractive for Loews shareholders. So we are happy to continue to own our businesses. We're happy to repurchase shares and we're happy to have significant amounts of cash on our balance sheet. So we don't feel any strong urge or itch to go out and do a big deal.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could, Pete, 2 specific financial questions, if you have it handy. I was curious if you had what the general partner dividend payment to work from -- at the Boardwalk General Partner for the full year? And then also with the refinancing and capital contribution you mentioned at HighMount, what the year-end debt level was at that division?","Peter W. Keegan","HighMount redid its -- basically, its term debt and brought it down from $1.1 billion to $700 million. The total term debt available is $850 million. So the term debt of HighMount is $700 million. I don't have the exact GP dividends, but we can get back to you with that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel of Langen McAlenney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","A couple of quick questions, numbers of questions in HighMount and then some more subset in the questions about the fundamentals there. What are your carrying values at year-end for it, with the increased divestments? Were there any write-downs at all?","Peter W. Keegan","No. There were no write-downs in the fourth quarter of either ceiling test impairments or goodwill.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. So the carrying value just goes up by the 2 new investments in?","Peter W. Keegan","Effectively, yes.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Which -- it may total -- give me the numbers again. You were going quickly, I didn't get them down.","Peter W. Keegan","Well, for HighMount?","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Right.","Peter W. Keegan","Yes. We put in $106 million -- we contributed $106 million for acquisitions, and we put in $400 million in capital that was the offset to the debt going from $1.1 billion to $700 million.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","So $506 million is what the carrying value goes out by?","Peter W. Keegan","That's the amount we put in. That's correct.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. And then Jim, you seemed like pretty excited -- more excited about that business in commenting about trends and with the gas prices having come down quite a bit. And you and I debated in the last few years -- over the last few years, what has to happen to have the infrastructure in this country change and whether it requires the government or the free market to work. But there doesn't seem to be much progress over this time. What has to happen for -- beyond the -- obviously, the prices going up? What has to happen to move demand up in this country for gas?","James S. Tisch","First, back to economics 101. The thing is going to move demand up as price is going down, our price is going up. Price going up is really appreciated by us. But in order for demand to increase, price needs to be down. Gas price -- spot gas price is now about $2.50 in Mcf. That's the equivalent to about $15 per barrel of oil. Oil is currently trading -- West Texas Intermediate is trading at $97 a barrel and Brent Crude, which has really become the international marker, is at $115 a barrel. So gas is very, very cheap. And what we've seen is that we've had a number of years now where gas has traded under 30% of the price of oil. And what I what that is doing, I believe, is that it is getting people to think about changing from oil to natural gas. I spoke to somebody just this weekend, who told me that he spent a few hundred thousand dollars in his commercial building in New York City, switching from heating oil to natural gas. So all manner of projects to put natural gas, either compressed or LNG, into service stations so that trucks and delivery vehicles and private passenger automobiles can consume natural gas. We're going to have closure of a relatively large number of coal-fired power plants that will then be replaced by natural gas. So there's no doubt in my mind that natural gas consumption will increase rather significantly over the next 4 or 5 years. Combined with that, there will also be, in the next several years, as LNG export facilities that will be able to -- each facility will be able to handle about 1.5% of daily natural gas production. So -- and that will be read by the market as additional demand for natural gas. So in my mind, there's a lot of things that will increase natural gas demand. The only problem is that since virtually all of these things require significant capital expenditures, it will take some time in order for that to be realized. But my belief is it will come online and in the past several years, we've seen natural gas consumption grow dramatically faster than oil consumption in the United States, and I think that's going to continue.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","So am I right in -- I mean, we have your actions of putting $500 million into this business and we have your words and your opening remarks would seem to suggest that you're pumped up about this segment, what potential returns can be over the next 3 to 5 years. Is that a fair characterization?","James S. Tisch","Somewhat, yes. We're also -- the $100 million that we invested in land acquisitions in Oklahoma is primarily in the oil. And we like very much the economics of that drilling program. As I mentioned on the last call, we spent about $100 million for land. And if we find the oil that we anticipate that we will find there, and will mobilize and do that right now. If we find that oil, there could be in excess of $1 billion of drilling activity to get that oil out, and we see attractive returns on that investment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Bunyaner, TLF Capital.","Michael Bunyaner","Would you be kind enough to comment on CNA? If one looks at premium to surplus, especially in light of the post-agreement with National Indemnity, we are very much over capitalized at CNA and clearly, they're beginning to increase their dividends, which is terrific. But nonetheless, the question is does that -- why not to make -- why not to begin to address the over capitalization a little bit more aggressively and\/or use CNA to make investments on a more permanent basis in larger companies rather than using Loews balance sheet to do that. Have you ever thought or considered doing that?","James S. Tisch","Well, the premium to surplus ratio is a good quick indicator of the capacity of an insurance company. But this stage, you really have a look as much, if not more, to the rating agencies and their dicta concerning the levels that insurance companies can operate out in terms of revenues that they can write. In that regard, CNA is -- you're right, very, very strong in terms of capital rating -- has ratings that would ordinarily make it, I think, a AA- rated insurance company. CNA, under Tom Motamed has a very significant growth plans. We're anticipating price increases this year and we're also looking to expand our market share volumes. So hopefully, over the next several years, we'll see that the -- what looks like excess surplus at CNA will be used and in essence, consumed supporting increased written premiums.","Michael Bunyaner","I had just one follow-up on the CNA. So the investment that has been made over the last 2 years-plus in the infrastructure and the sales force, that is really what we're betting on here. Is that correct?","James S. Tisch","That's correct.","Michael Bunyaner","And the next question on HighMount. You clearly have addressed them, again, congratulations for all the hard work to unlock shareholder value by having public entities in various of your businesses. HighMount has been a long-term investment, so I have 2 questions. One, what should take place or what type of an environment should we experience for a period of time that HighMount becomes a public company? Have you thought of that?","James S. Tisch","We really haven't. We've been focused on growing HighMount's business, expanding it into -- and diversifying it into oil and natural gas liquids, and putting in place a steady stream of production of those liquids. And that's still going to take some more time for us to fully diversify HighMount's production. So we're not thinking about what do we need to do in order to take this company public. That's just not on our radar screen.","Michael Bunyaner","And one last question on the fundamentals of gas. You remain to be very positive about long-term outlook and we finally started to see the gas rig count to decline. Is there anything in the marketplace that tells you that the covenants that various companies have there, that have been very aggressive in drilling and have a lot of debt, that we may actually get to a place where there will be forced shutdown anytime soon? Or is it just not where we are at the moment?","James S. Tisch","I haven't seen anything specific, but my instinct and my bones tell me that there are a significant number of independent gas E&P companies that are going to have a lot of trouble. The -- with gas trading at $3.5 or $4, the industry was going to operate at minus $25 billion cash flow. I mean, they were going to have to raise $25 billion outside sources. And now spot gas prices at $2.50 and hedges running off for E&P companies, I think there -- in some boardrooms, there's concern that's moving to fear that's going to move to panic. And I think that the decline in rigs is just one symptom of that. Now we'll have to see how this all plays out over the next 6 months to a year, but it looks like we are going to end the heating season with record amounts of natural gas that's going to put some pressure on natural gas prices. We're also seeing the time spreads increasing because people think that natural gas will go up in the future, which is, to some extent, benefiting Boardwalk Pipeline. I think though that it's going to take some time for the -- measured in a number of quarters for natural gas to really hit bottom and start to move up. And I think that as that happens, they will be more discipline on the part of gas E&P companies so that they won't be so -- go out with such reckless abandon in terms of the drilling program.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research Associates.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","I guess some more HighMount. Could you give us some idea of when you first bought HighMount, what you thought it would be worth long term, long term might have been as much as 20 years? And to what extent that number might have changed considering us going out, considering that frac-ing is unleashing lots of reserves, although I guess, they were just produced?","James S. Tisch","A good question, Mike. When we bought HighMount, natural gas prices were about $7.5 to $7.75 in Mcf. And in the first year, it went through -- it just about doubled to about $15 per Mcf. And now gas prices have declined, I guess, 80% or so to under $3 an Mcf. Nobody is making money at these levels. And my guess is that even though HighMount isn't public, that obviously, the value of our investment is lower today than it was when we made the investment. We did not anticipate the tremendous impact that frac-ing would have on the supply of natural gas. And likewise, I don't think that anybody really fully understood what that impact would be. Having said that, what's happened since then is that the cost of looking for natural gas, just as the price of rigs and other services has come down, but nonetheless, at $2.50 or $3 an Mcf, virtually, nobody can look for natural gas or dry gas and be profitable doing it. So my fearless forecast is that natural gas prices will go up over the coming quarters and years, and reach a equilibrium price that will still probably be lower than when we originally got into HighMount. Having said that, I am optimistic about HighMount's future. I'm optimistic about the investment opportunities that we have there, and believe that we will be able to earn good rates of return on our investment in it.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Good. Switching to hotels. You mentioned asset, like I think, most of the hotels you currently own, you're talking about doing franchising or managing hotels or some combination?","James S. Tisch","No. We're not thinking of franchising per se. We are in the ownership and management business, and we think that we should be able to increase the number of hotels that we have by putting some equity money in, but having partners in ownership. And likewise, we are also going to be looking to increase the number of just hotels that we have under management.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Sam Yake, BGB Securities.","Sam Yake - BGB Securities, Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering, when you evaluate potential investments for Loews, do you apply a pretty strict test of evaluating -- of measuring those potential investments against buying back more Loews stock?","James S. Tisch","Absolutely, positively. When we buy a business that we don't know, there's a lot of uncertainty to it. And the thing that we happen to know best is Loews, and because 3 of our subsidiaries are public, we have a very good sense of what those businesses are worth. So when we buy back our shares, we don't have to pay a premium. We're able to buy it market price. Then when we buy another company, typically, you have to pay a premium to the market price. So all of that and more figures into the calculus that we go through when we think about buying a new business versus buying in our own shares.","Sam Yake - BGB Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. It just seems to me that where the stock has been trading recently, there's very few potential investments that could come close to meeting that test. And I guess, when you mentioned that you had to scale back your stock repurchase in the fourth quarter, I'm wondering, have you thought about -- could you possibly institute like a 10b5-1 plan so you could get around many restrictions?","James S. Tisch","I didn't say we have to scale back our share repurchases. What I said is that I'm not going to comment about our share repurchases. And I'll just say that our lawyers here are aware of the current state-of-the-art in technology in share repurchases, and we consider all of that when we do buy our shares.","Sam Yake - BGB Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I have one kind of one last big picture question. And that is, when I look back at the history of Loews, and you've been so successful over a long period of time, and you had that -- the creative transaction where you spun off boulevard [ph] in that -- a tax-efficient way that benefited shareholders. I'm wondering, what kind of factors do you look at when you think about potentially doing that type of deal again with one of your subsidiaries?","James S. Tisch","The thing that we keep talking about is how we are focused on creating long-term value for all of our shareholders. That really is what drives us every day in what we do. And there are -- we try not to have any bias in our analysis of opportunities. We just try to look for the transactions that will create the most value for all our shareholders. And we find that as we start to explore and get knowledgeable about different transactions, we tend to figure out what really is the best way to execute them in order to create that value. So it's just a long process of a lot of hard work, study and diligence.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the conference over to Mary Skafidas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning everyone, and welcome to Loews call. A copy of our earnings release, earnings supplement, and company overview, may be found on our website, loews.com.","On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Edelson. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session, which will include questions from our shareholders.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward-looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those made or implied in any forward-looking statements due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings.

This disclaimer is only a brief summary of the company's statutory forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included in the company's filings with the SEC.","During the call today, we might also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our security filings and earnings supplement for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.","In a few minutes, our Chief Financial Officer, David Edelson will walk you through key drivers for the quarter, but before he does, Jim Tisch, our CEO, will kick off the call.","Jim, over to you.","Jim Tisch","Thank you, Mary, and good morning.","Loews had another good quarter with strong results from our largest subsidiary CNA. In the quarter, CNA's domestic property and casualty net written premium was up by 8% and rate was up by about 4%. The sizable increase over last year and last quarter reflect significant new business development, as well as sustained improvement in pricing across a number of business lines.","Since our CFO, David Edelson will do a deeper dive into CNA's numbers, I want to focus my remarks today, primarily on CNA's strategic direction over the mid to long term, our confidence in their strategy and the state of the P&C industry.","Reflecting our confidence in CNA through last Friday, Loews spent nearly $0.5 billion on share repurchases and CNA currently accounts for more than 70% of the value of each Loews share. Now that I've told you how much we believe in their strategy, let me walk you through some of the reasoning for this confidence.","CNA's management team has done the work to enhance profitability by establishing a highly disciplined expert underwriting culture. Additionally, the company has strengthened its talent pool and built mechanisms to share expertise across the organization through critical investments in technology and analytics.","At the same time, CNA has embedded a disciplined awareness of expense management throughout the company. The CNA team has worked diligently and successfully to deliver improved growth and profitability with the goal of remaining a consistent top quartile underwriter. CNA's underlying loss ratio continues to be in line with the loss ratios of the company's peers.","In terms of the expense ratio, there is still a few points of improvement to be had and the CNA team has plans to achieve that improvement. Adding to my confidence in CNA and without diminishing the company's achievements and what is still a competitive marketplace, in my 40 years of experience in the insurance industry, I have never known it to be more financially disciplined than it has been for the past five years.","Since CNA and its peer companies are allocating almost all of the earnings to dividends and share buybacks, there is less appetite to underwrite unprofitable risk. With the continual return of capital to shareholders over that five-year period, management's are loath to disappoint their investors with strategies to increase volume at the expense of profitability.","Turning to Diamond Offshore. The company continues to be affected by a longer than expected downturn in the offshore drilling market. As I mentioned last quarter, while Diamond may add a lot of noise to Loews' quarterly results, our downside is limited to the value of our equity stake, which comes to less than $2 per Loews share.","And although we offshore drilling market continues to be challenging, there is a positive side to the ledger, since 2015, diamond has restructured its fleet to focus on its most competitive assets and has selectively invested in several assets that operate in attractive niche markets.","Furthermore, Diamond has differentiated itself from the competition through value-added innovations that enhanced drilling efficiency and save customers time and money. Diamond has accomplished all of this while maintaining its focus on operational excellence and continuous improvements in safety.","We believe that these actions coupled with prudent financial management have positioned Diamond to capitalize on an eventual recovery. We also have some news from our packaging subsidiary CCC, which made an exciting acquisition at June of this year. It bought Tri State Distribution which expanded CCC's footprint in the pharmaceutical packaging space, a specialty growth segment in the industry.","Pharmaceutical packaging now accounts for more than 11% of CCC's total sales. A way of background, Loews acquired CCC a little over two years ago. Since then the company has made six tuck-in acquisitions for a total purchase price of $300 million, all of which were funded at the CCC level.","These acquisitions either added scale at extremely attractive post synergy multiples or increased CCC's presence in specialty segments. The management team continues to evaluate other possible targets that could add size and scale or diversify CCC into segments, with strong growth potential.","Finally, it wouldn't be a Loews earning call without a mention of share repurchases. Fun fact, 10 years ago, Loews had about 40% more shares outstanding than it does today. As for this year, to date, we've repurchased just over 10 million shares. And in the second quarter of this year, we repurchased a little over 3 million shares.","We've continued to buy low stock because in our view, it's still trading below its intrinsic value, not to mention the fact, that share repurchases remain an important way that we create long-term value for all Loews shareholders.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David Edelson, Loews' CFO, who will explain key drivers for the quarter.","David Edelson","Thank you, Jim, and good morning.","For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $249 million or $0.82 per share compared to $230 million or $0.72 per share in last year's second quarter. Our net income was up 8% over the prior year, while our earnings per share increased 14%. As average shares outstanding declined almost 5% from Q2 2018, given our share repurchase activity","CNA continues to be by far the largest contributor to our net income and it posted a slight year-over-year increase. The bulk of the quarterly increase, however, was driven by Boardwalk Pipelines as its net income contribution more than tripled mainly due to two factors; number one, our ownership increase from 51% last year to the current 100%; and two, Boardwalk booked a net benefit of $19 million resulting from a customer bankruptcy and related contract cancellation.","Offsetting the increases from Boardwalk and CNA were lower year-over-year contributions by Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels. Despite the fact that Loews Hotels had an excellent quarter operationally.","Let me now delve into the results in more depth. CNA contributed net income of $249 million, up from $240 million last year. This modest increase resulted from several nearly offsetting factors, underlying underwriting income, which excludes catastrophe losses and prior year development improved with CNA posting an underlying combined ratio of 94.6%, which was 0.7 points better than last year's second quarter.","Despite the increase in underlying underwriting income, however, total underwriting income declined because of a lower level of favorable prior year development and marginally higher cat losses.","CNA's calendar year combined ratio was 95.7%, which was 1.9 points above last year's second quarter result, but still highly respectable. CNA's after-tax investment income in its P&C segment was essentially identical to Q2 2018.","The Corporate and Life & Group segments both had significant favorable variances. In last year's second quarter, CNA incurred one-time costs from transitioning to a new IT infrastructure service provider.","These non-recurring costs were booked in CNA's Corporate segment. And in Life & Group, results improved largely from continuing favorable persistency and long-term care as many policyholders chose to lapse coverage or reduce benefits in lieu of premium rate increases.","Finally, an early redemption charge on the retirement of debt reduced CNA's contribution to our net income by $15 million. In summary CNA posted strong P&C underwriting and investment results and improved results in its non-P&C segments.","Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a $52 million net loss compared to a $37 million net loss in last year's second quarter. Diamond's results continue to be negatively affected by the challenging conditions in the global offshore drilling market, while numerous factors impacted Diamond's quarterly results and comparison, let me highlight three of them.","Number one, contract drilling revenues were down 22% year-over-year as revenue earning days declined 8%, and average daily revenue per working rig was down 14%. Downtime, contract timing and lower day rates drove these declines.","Number two, contract drilling expenses were up 19%, with the increase largely attributable to the adverse impact of the amortization of deferred contract prep and more costs incurred to ready certain rigs for their current contracts.","And number three, Diamond booked a rig impairment charge last year which reduced Diamond's contribution to our Q2 2018 net income by $12 million and a gain on sale this year, which increased our net income by $5 million.","As we have highlighted for the past several quarters, Diamond remains focused on maintaining a healthy liquidity position while investing in its fleet to ensure its rigs are considered top tier by customers.","Boardwalk's net income contribution was $53 million, up from $16 million in Q2 2018, mainly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to 100% and the contract cancellation payment referenced earlier.","Operationally Boardwalk had a good quarter, absent the contract cancellation payment, net revenues were up 5.7%, EBITDA margins expanded by about 50 basis points and EBITDA rose 6.3%. The underlying revenue increase was propelled by growth projects recently placed in service, revenue offsets included the net impact of contract restructurings, expirations and renewals.","Let's turn to Loews Hotels, which contributed $12 million to our net income, down from $17 million last year. Loews Hotels underlying year-over-year earnings gains were obscured this quarter by pre-opening expenses on properties under development and by the write-off of capitalized costs related to our terminated development project.","These items totaled $7 million after-tax in Q2 versus almost no such expenses last year. Revenues declined mainly due to the sale of two owned hotel properties during the past 12 months as well as renovations at a few owned hotels.","As a reminder, Loews Hotels uses the equity method of accounting for its joint venture properties meaning the revenues for those properties, which include the hotels at the Universal Orlando Resort are not shown as revenue in our GAAP financial results.","Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA which excludes non-recurring items and is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary was $68 million in the quarter, up from $67 million in last year's second quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA is $129 million versus $123 million last year.","I would note that the renovation activity cited above and the sale of three properties over the last 12 months, two owned in one JV, held back the year-over-year adjusted EBITDA comparison. The opening of almost 4,100 rooms in Kansas City, Orlando, St, Louis, and Arlington, Texas from Q2 2019 through Q4 2020 should provide a boost to adjusted EBITDA.","Turning to the parent company. Investment income was down modestly. Contributing to the decline was a lower level of invested assets including a much smaller portfolio of limited partnership investments.","At June 30, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.5 billion with 80% in cash and equivalents and the remainder, mainly in marketable equity securities and a portfolio of limited partnership investments. The LP portfolio has declined from about $950 million at June 30, 2018 to $250 million at quarter end, consistent with our decision to shrink the size of this portfolio.","As a reminder, the parent company portfolio totaled $4.7 billion on June 30, 2018, which was just prior to the July 2018 purchase for $1.5 billion of the Boardwalk LP units not previously owned by Loews.","Consolidated Container, which is reported as part of other corporate results completed the acquisition of Tri State distribution late in the second quarter. Non-recurring expenses connected to the acquisition negatively affected other corporate results in Q2. We received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the past quarter, $25 million from Boardwalk and $85 million from CNA.","Dividends received year-to-date totaled just over $700 million. We repurchased 3 million shares of our common stock during the second quarter for a total of $151 million. After quarter end, we repurchased an additional 421,000 shares for just under $23 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 0.4 million shares or 3.3% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.","I will now hand the call back to Mary.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Mary Skafidas","Thank you, David. We have three questions submitted from shareholders. Our first question is, a few months ago, a few months back, Jim you talked about moving Loews cash out of hedge funds. Can you give us an update on that?","Jim Tisch","Sure. So as David said, a year ago, we had about $4.7 billion in cash and liquid investments and today that number is about $3.5 billion. The reason the cash and liquid investments has declined is because offsetting the close to $1 billion of cash inflow that we had from dividends over the past year from our subsidiaries, we spent $1.5 billion acquiring the minority interest in Boardwalk, we also spent approximately $1 billion on share repurchases.","So with $3.5 billion rather than close to $5 billion, we decided that we needed to make some adjustments in our investment portfolio. And one of the areas where we especially wanted to make an adjustment was in our hedge funds. We've decided that the returns that we've received on the hedge funds haven't been sufficient for the risk.","My guess for why that's been the case, is that, the hedge fund space, as I think everybody knows is very, very crowded and returns have been competed away. So we still retain about $250 million in hedge funds, and we also have approximately $600 million in equities and other than that, our investments are primarily in treasury bills, treasury notes and other short-term money market instruments.","Mary Skafidas","Next question is recent capital allocation at Loews has primarily focused on share buybacks. Is Loews actively looking to add another business at the holding company level?","Jim Tisch","So what I find so amazing is that dry powder within the private equity world continues to move upwards and the leverage markets have also been very accommodating to highly levered transactions.","So in my mind this has created a massive supply demand imbalance between assets that are for sale and buyers that are equal - that are eager to buy them. So what's happened is that multiples have moved up rather significantly and they've moved up in just about every sub-sector of the market.","Making matters worse, investment bankers and sellers have found adjustments to earnings with which to market their assets. There is now a term called adjusted EBITDA, and as you might imagine, when someone is selling a business, adjusted EBITDA is higher oftentimes, significantly higher than the stated EBITDA. Those adjustments reflect what sellers considered to be one-time cost that should be excluded and future benefits, that should be included. ","So as a result, while the fancy charts may show private asset multiples approaching their 07 peaks. It's my estimation that in fact, they far surpass it. And as I would like to say, welcome to the world of low interest rates. My guess is that what we've seen going on will persist for some time and while we remain dutifully on watch for any potential opportunities, I'm basically pretty skeptical that we'll be adding a new leg in this environment.","What I'm seeing today is that you really need synergies in order to make the math on any corporate acquisition work. So for all of these reasons, we continue to acquire assets where we currently have strong businesses that can make use of the synergies, but it seems to me, highly unlikely that we'll get into any new industry or business at this point in time.","Mary Skafidas","Last question from shareholder is, can you talk about CCC and what the company is doing to differentiate itself and add value to its customer base? Can you also address, how CCC is addressing the impact of its products on the environment?","Jim Tisch","So let me start with an update on our investment thesis in CCC, a reminder for you. We were attracted to CCC because it was a good size player in a highly, highly fragmented market that we felt could serve as a platform for growth for Loews in the packaging industry.","As I mentioned on the call, in the past several years, Loews - since Loews acquired CCC, we've made six tuck-in acquisitions. These acquisitions have helped us to diversify CCC away from the dairy and water packaging business which has been declining and it's also these acquisitions have also added very significant post acquisitions synergies.","These tuck-ins were all financed self funded by CCC. But all is not entirely sunshine in those, there are headwinds on the - in the industry, including increased labor costs and also a steeper decline in the dairy and water volumes than we had previously expected.","But overall, the original investment thesis still holds. Now in terms of adding value to their customers, CCC's first step with any customer is to try to understand what their priorities are and to develop our customized packaging solution for them.","So one example of providing value added is our recent CCC innovation that adds value not only by helping customers meet their needs, but also by reducing the impact of plastic packaging on the environment, and specifically, what I'm talking about is a product from CCC called Dura-Lite, it's a - in the packaging world, it really is a major leap forward.","Dura-Lite was introduced in 2016, and it's a technology that creates a plastic container that is as strong or stronger than the original, but using the 10% to 20% less resin. So Dura-Lite bottles now make up more than 50% of all the dairy and water gallon bottles that CCC ships.","And a side effect of that is that the Dura-Lite product has translated into 9 million fewer pounds of resin being used by CCC which gets us to the environmental part of the question. CCC is also, I'm proud to say, the second largest producer in United States of recycled high-density polyethylene, which is the major resin that CCC uses.","In the past, manufacturers have been reticent to use recycled resin in packaging, because it was more expensive per unit than virgin resin. But more recently, do I believe to the focus on sustainability, that picture has started to change and we're seeing that more companies are taking an interest in using this greener somewhat more expensive packaging material.","I'd like to add that CCC takes very seriously the impact the plastic packaging has on the earth and it continues to develop solutions that are better for the world and better for CCC's customers. Thanks.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Jim. Stephanie, over to you for questions on the call.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Now, Jim, I'm not trying to putting words in your mouth, but I did hear something that I was surprised in the prepared remarks. You said that given the valuation currently at Diamond if the - your downside was maximum $2 of value and overall low shares today, typically when people talk like that, it presents sort of a view that you think there is a possibility that maybe Diamond - the equity Diamond isn't worth anything. I don't think that's what you said. But I'd like to hear, why you share that data with us and what your outlook is?","Jim Tisch","So my outlook is that the offshore drilling business is going to come back at some point in time. What I'm pleased about with respect to Diamond is that it has a fleet that is very strong and capable and when the recovery comes which eventually will, I believe that Diamond will be able to do well in that environment.","I think that a big problem for offshore drilling has been the price of oil, which has been not only volatile, but relatively low, it's competing with Shale production, which offshore drilling has been competing with Shale production and right now that is the flavor du jour for the oil markets.","But while all this time has passed and while the offshore drilling market has been weak, what we've seen is a large amount of scrapping in the offshore drilling space. I've been through this movie once before in the supertanker business, in the early to mid '80s and there are two things that are going on simultaneously.","Number one, we're seeing that demand is going down and we're also seeing that rigs are being laid up, and as they get laid up and those companies don't have the funds to maintain and invest in those rigs, they deteriorate sitting on the water as they do a highly corrosive environment and after a few years of that rigs become more and more expensive to reactivate.","So my guess is that over the next several years, we're going to - if oil prices don't improve and if activity doesn't increase - does not increase significantly, we will see more rigs scrapped no longer in the market.","And then at some point in time, the supply and the demand curve will change, there will be more demand for rigs and bingo, there won't be enough supply and before you know it, rates will go up again. So my view is that there will be at some point in time a change in the marketplace.","Going back to my $2 comment, I mentioned that because Diamond Offshore is consolidated with Loews. And so it's earnings show up in our net income numbers and the mention of $2 was simply a reflection of the fact that even though those profit and loss numbers may be significant within Loews that the total value of our investment according to Mr. Market is less than $2 per Loews share.","Josh Shanker","And if the cost of financing Diamond outlast it is greater than this drought can support with Loews be willing to bridge finance Diamond to get it through the drought and your ownership stake would change of course in that situation?","Jim Tisch","So Diamond has added 4.5 years of backlog at attractive rates. We believe the Diamond based on the way it's financed has a very strong runway. And we believe that Diamond can do well in an improving environment which I think is coming. As for additional investments, we'll have to wait and see just what the opportunities are, and we will do whatever is in the best interest of the Loews shareholders.","Josh Shanker","I might be wrong in my timing a little bit, Jim, but I think, four years ago you raised some debt, I think at about a 2% yield. My numbers might not be completely right, mostly the reason was, as you couldn't believe the opportunity in the market to raise cheap financing. And so you issued some paper. Obviously, we are going into another trough period for interest rates, does Loews have any interest in expanding its balance sheet just because the timing makes sense?","Jim Tisch","No, not really. The - we have - the coupons that we have are Loews debt range from 2% and 5% ways to 6%. We don't feel that additional debt at the Loews level will make a significant difference for how we operate the business.","So notwithstanding the low rates, Loews is now looking to raise any more debt. For our subsidiaries, they're using the opportunity to refinance some of their debts, but we're not borrowing speculatively at this point in time, and have no intention to do so.","Josh Shanker","And I understand that you want all of the businesses to be freestanding and supporting themselves, but at some point, does it make any economic sense for Loews to be an intermediate lender to the subsidiaries because Loews' cost of capitals much lower than theirs and they would take a loan from you and you would take a loan from the public?","Jim Tisch","So as you know from time to time, we have provided financing for our subsidiaries. But as a general principle, we want our subsidiaries to finance themselves and they all know and understand that and have structured the finances in such a way that they can get that outside financing.","Josh Shanker","Okay. Well, thank you for the answers to all my questions.","Jim Tisch","My pleasure.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Josh. And that concludes the Loews call for today. As always, thank you for your continued interest. A replay will be available on the Loews website in approximately two hours. Again, that concludes the Loews call for today.","Operator","Thank you.

I will now turn the conference over to Mary Skafidas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Chrystal. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Loews call. A copy of our earnings release, earnings supplement and company overview may be found on our website, loews.com. On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Edelson.

Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those made or implied in any forward-looking statements, due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings.

Jim, over to you.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Mary. Good morning. And thank you for joining us on our call today. I'd like to start out by discussing Loews' recently announced entry into the packaging industry. As you probably know by now, a few weeks ago, we signed an agreement to acquire Consolidated Container Company or CCC for $1.2 billion. The company is a leading rigid plastic packaging manufacturer based in Atlanta, Georgia that makes containers for stable end markets such as beverages, motor oil, laundry detergent and dairy products. The acquisition of CCC will add a new industry to Loews' already diverse portfolio of businesses and provide a great foundation for expansion through organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions.","We've been analyzing the packaging industry for quite some time, getting to know it well and looking for the right deal and we believe we found it. CCC is an outstanding company that checks all the boxes for Loews' criteria. First, first of all, the size of the investment meets the Goldilocks test. The $600 million check is just right, allowing us to feel comfortable about making add-on investments down the road. Aside from the size of the investment, the other checkboxes are the fragmentation of the industry, the opportunity for add-on investments, their defensive position in consumer end markets, strong cash-on-cash returns and a highly qualified management team.","Consolidated sector of the packaging industry is attractive to us for a number of reasons. The rigid plastic packaging sector is somewhat recession-resistant in that its products are used primarily for non-discretionary consumer items. And while there are evolutionary changes in the business, we believe it's unlikely that this sector will be subject to major technological disruption.","CCC is the largest national player in the small-to-medium volume segment of this industry with 59 manufacturing facilities across the U.S., either co-located or close to their customers, a distinct advantage in minimizing transportation costs. The company has long-term client relationships with little turnover in its customer base. Over the last several years, CCC has focused on customers who have small, but growing brands that have been challenging traditional incumbents in various product classes, such as Seventh Generation cleaning products and Persil laundry detergents.","A data point that will come as no surprise to our shareholders is that we especially like the steady cash flow characteristics of this sector. We anticipate near-double-digit cash-on-cash returns on our investment. CCC's free cash flow will, for the foreseeable future, be used either to pay down debt or to finance acquisitions. Finally and most importantly, CCC has a strong and experienced management team with a track record of operational excellence.","As I've said before, we've kicked a lot of tires in this process and we have yet to come across a management team as ready for primetime as CCC's. We look forward to working with its CEO Sean Fallmann and his team to profitably grow the company. The acquisition of CCC would be financed with approximately 50% cash and 50% debt at the CCC level. For Loews, this is a relatively small acquisition that allows us to continue to retain substantial liquidity at the parent company. After the close, Loews will still have approximately $5 billion of cash and investments. We expect the transaction to close later this month and we'll include partial quarter financial results for the Loews Packaging Group in our second quarter earnings release. As far as this quarter goes, I'm happy with our results and the progress of each of our subsidiaries.","Our CFO, David Edelson, will now provide more details. Over to you David.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Jim, and good morning.","For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $295 million or $0.87 per share, up from $102 million or $0.30 per share in last year's first quarter. I will call out the key drivers of our $193 million year-over-year quarterly earnings improvement. These are also set forth on page 12 of our earnings supplement. The supplement is available by webcast and has been posted to the Loews' IR website.","In summary, CNA had an excellent quarter and contributed the bulk of our net income, accounting for approximately 80% of the total. Similarly, CNA drove our year-over-year increase, with Boardwalk Pipeline, Loews Hotels and parent company investments also contributing. Diamond Offshore was the main earnings drag this quarter given the ongoing difficult conditions in the offshore drilling market.","Turning to the details. CNA's substantial increase in net income came on the back of strong net investment income, a lower retroactive reinsurance charge than in the prior year, a significant turnaround in realized gains and good underwriting results in its core P&C business with especially favorable results in Specialty and International.","As a reminder, in the first quarter of last year, CNA's results were depressed by three items: realized investment losses, which reduced our net income by $17 million; losses on LP investments, which reduced our net income by $7 million; and a retroactive reinsurance charge, which reduced our net income by $74 million. The charge was related to the transfer of the company's asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities to National Indemnity in 2010.","Taken together, these three items lowered CNA's contribution to our first quarter 2016 net income by $98 million. Conversely, in this year's first quarter, CNA posted realized investment gains, not losses, which benefited our net income by $20 million. CNA's LP investments returned 3.8%, benefiting our net income by $54 million. And while CNA booked a non-cash retroactive reinsurance charge again this year, it was far smaller than last year's, reducing our net income by only $12 million versus last year's $74 million.","So on a year-over-year basis, these three items accounted for $160 million of the $174 million increase in CNA's contribution to our net income in Q1 2017. Away from these items, CNA showed improved results from current accident year P&C underwriting and from the Life and Group segment, offset in part by a lower level of favorable prior-year development.","Beyond CNA, our year-over-year earnings improvement was driven by Boardwalk, Loews Hotels and parent company investments, offset by earnings declines at Diamond. Boardwalk's contribution to our net income increased year-over-year by 19% or $6 million, as revenues were up from recently completed growth projects, as well as favorable market conditions for the company's storage, and parking and lending services. Boardwalk's excellent performance was highlighted by its net revenues being up 7% and EBITDA up 11%. Loews Hotels also had a good quarter, with net income of $10 million. During the quarter, the company booked a gain on the sale of the JV property and wrote down its equity investment in another non-Orlando JV property. These two onetime items netted to add $6 million to Q1 2017 net income.","Setting aside these items, net income at Loews Hotels increased $1 million year-over-year. The main downdraft in the quarter was from Diamond Offshore, as the depressed conditions in the offshore drilling space continued. Diamond's contribution to our Q1 net income declined from $43 million last year to $12 million in this year's first quarter. This $31 million negative swing was largely attributable to two factors. Diamond received a onetime demobilization fee last year that increased Diamond's contribution to our Q1 2016 net income by $13 million and Diamond's contract drilling revenue declined 10% excluding this demobilization fee, primarily due to fewer revenue-earning days. It is simply not possible for Diamond management to reduce expenses enough to compensate for the significant revenue declines it has experienced.","Turning to the parent company. Net investment income was strong in Q1 2017, as alternative investments in equities, including gold-related equities, drove $59 million of pre-tax investment income. In comparison, the parent company portfolio generated a loss in last year's first quarter, as favorable results from gold-related equities were more than offset by unfavorable results from alternatives and other equities.","Let me explain briefly the bump-up in our corporate expenses in the first quarter. Two items, expenses related to acquisition activity and the timing of bonus accruals, accounted for the lion's share of the increase. We expect to have additional acquisition-related expenses in the second quarter. As for bonuses, we will be accruing them ratably throughout the year this year, so this is simply a timing difference.","Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At March 31, the parent company portfolio totaled $5.6 billion, with two-thirds in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments.","The parent company portfolio will decrease by just over $600 million upon the closing of the Consolidated Container transaction in May. During the first quarter, we received $559 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $546 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. Dividends received from CNA included the $2 per share special dividend, which itself totaled $485 million. We had no share repurchase activity during the first quarter.","I will now hand the call back to Jim.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Thank you, David. Before we open the call to questions, I want to summarize our thoughts on CCC. Loews does not often make acquisitions at the holding company level. We have certainly looked at a lot of deals and industries over the past several years, but none have completely fit our criteria until now. Our goal is and has always been to create long-term shareholder value through responsible capital allocation. I believe that CCC gives us the platform for the type of growth that we've been looking for.","Now, back to Mary.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Jim and thank you, David. Chrystal, before we open up the call to questions from participants, we wanted to take one question from shareholders that was emailed in. The question is: Jim, how would you think about the Consolidated Container acquisition versus buying shares of Diamond, which is trading at 20-year lows? Has your view on the secular versus cyclical challenges at Diamond changed?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So, no, our views on the secular versus cyclical challenges at Diamond haven't changed and this is not \u2013 the purchase of CCC was not an either-or decision vis-\u00e0-vis Diamond Offshore. When the CCC acquisition closes, we'll still have close to $5 billion of cash on our balance sheet. Rather, we saw this as \u2013 we saw CCC as an attractive investment for Loews Corporation. It's the exact opposite in many ways of Diamond. It's totally non-cyclical compared to the extreme cyclicality of Diamond Offshore. It seems to us to be a platform for growth. And with respect to Diamond, even at today's very low market price for Diamond, Loews still has $1 billion of exposure to the offshore drilling industry. So from a portfolio perspective, we're very comfortable with our exposure to and the upside potential for Diamond Offshore and we're also happy to have a new subsidiary that has all the possibility that I spoke about in my remarks just a few minutes ago.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Great. Thank you, Jim. Chrystal, we'd like to hand it back over to you so that you could give participants on the call instructions for asking questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Janney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning, Loews. Is it plug-and-play with CCC or is there some enhancements that you can add to either the expense side or strategy?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","No, they are good to go for us as soon as they close. There will be some minor things that have to be done just to make sure that we can account for CCC properly as a public company. But otherwise, they are fully loaded and ready to go under the Loews' banner.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Are there any numbers you want to share with us as far as earnings power, run rate or EBITDA?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Look, what I've said publicly is that we're acquiring CCC at just over 8 times EBITDA and that we foresee that we will have close to double-digit cash-on-cash returns in the first year from the investment.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Both of which, we think, is very compelling for us.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","The $600 million is the cash investment that we should think in terms of...","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Yeah. Yes.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","And you said that the cash from this will be used to either pay down debt or do deals, so we shouldn't look for any dividends from this upstairs over the near term?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Not initially. As I said in my remarks, we see this as a great platform for us to make additional investments in the space. And no, we don't have any additional investments teed up at this point in time.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Gotcha.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","I should say, no, the management of CCC doesn't have any investments teed up at this point in time.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Does this impact the buyback program prospect, assume either the need for the money or the need for information transmission impacted buyback in Q1, are you frozen in Q2 as well or...?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","We're not frozen at all. So we can still buy back shares. We can still \u2013 if we find it by yet another leg to the stool, we have \u2013 as I said, when the dust settles from this transaction, we'll have close to $5 billion in cash, which for us is a very comfortable cash position that doesn't constrain us in any way in terms of our quest to allocate capital to build long-term shareholder value.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Cool. Last question. What was the biggest contributor to the trading gains in the quarter?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","I think, if I have to say, it was the strength of the stock market. Our results are correlated to the stock market and also to gold prices because we have a not very large, but somewhat volatile investment in gold securities.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you, Jimmy.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","My pleasure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, everybody.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Good morning.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Good morning.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Can you talk a little bit, Jim, about how you set executive comp here? You have a new business now and how will we know and how will you know whether it will be successful via remuneration of the people who are running it?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So the team at \u2013 first of all, we like very much the team at CCC. We think they're very strong, they're very professional, they know their space, they know their competition. And so, as I said, they are really ready for primetime. We have, in terms of compensation, we have agreements in place with the management team that is designed to align our interests exactly with their interests. So to the extent that earnings, earnings and the value of the enterprise grows over the next three to five years, Loews' shareholders will benefit as will the CCC management team.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","What is the base case versus what is the exemplary compensation case?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","I don't want to go into any of the specifics because that I think will be seen as a projection and as you know, we like to give projections. Just rest assured that we think that the goal is entirely reasonable. It would be great for Loews if it's achieved, but we think it is very much achievable.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And a hotels question. How is your occupancy rates, and your charge per room, or charge for key, I guess, going over the past 12 months or 3 months. What's the trend right now?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Well, the operations are doing well at Loews Hotels. I would say \u2013 I would just point out, however Orlando, which is a major business within Loews Hotels, is doing extremely well and as you know, recently opened some additional rooms. I would point out that the Loews Miami Beach was also a major driver of Loews Hotels, was under renovation and that renovation concluded in the second half of the year, into the first quarter of this year. So that put a bit of a damper on some of the results, but net-net doing well.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And how is the search for new cities coming and the extent that the pricing of both the joint operating agreements and new properties is attractive or unattractive at this moment?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Being pursued aggressively, being very selective, attempting to work with attractive partners in many of those circumstances to be able to find the right opportunity and earn the right return, sort of smart capital-effective growth. And so that's what we're doing. So hopefully, we'll have things to talk about before too long.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for all your answers.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Sure.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I will now turn the conference back to Mary.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Great.

Tisch","Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. And I hope everybody is staying dry and staying safe. As you know by now, Loews reported earnings for the quarter of $177 million, or $0.47 -- $0.45 per share, compared to $162 million, or $0.40 per share, that Loews earned in the third quarter of 2011. Results for the third quarter of 2012 include impairment charges of $166 million after tax at HighMount relating to the carrying value of its producing properties. These charges were the result of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Absent the ceiling test impairment charges, our quarterly net income would have been $343 million or $0.87 per share.","Loews ended the third quarter with $3.8 billion in cash and investments at the holding company level. In the third quarter, we spent approximately $88 million buying back about 2.2 million shares of Loews' common stock. Our book value per share increased to $50.41 at the end of the third quarter from $47.33 a year -- at year end 2011.","Now let's take a closer look at each of our subsidiaries. CNA had another solid quarter. Results for the quarter were driven primarily by increased investment income, especially from limited partnerships. CNA continues to execute its strategy of focusing on select customer segments. About half of CNA's new business is now coming from these 7 focus segments, including health care and construction, areas where CNA has specialized underwriting capabilities.","Rates continued to improve and increased approximately 6% during the quarter in CNA's P&C operations. In CNA commercial, rates were up 8% for the quarter versus 7% in the second quarter and 2% during the third quarter of 2011. Rate increases, combined with management's underwriting strategies, are leading to improvements in CNA's underwriting results. CNA's loss ratio before catastrophes and prior year development continued to improve during the third quarter. In CNA commercial, for example, this ratio improved by almost 2.5 points versus last year's third quarter. Over the past few years, as management's actions have taken hold, CNA has narrowed the loss ratio gap with peers in its core commercial business.","This is the first quarter CNA has included Hardy Underwriting in its results. Hardy is CNA's recently acquired Lloyd's syndicate and is off to a strong start.","Turning to Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling market. Diamond had a good quarter, although its net income was down $79 million versus the same period last year. Two main factors drove the profit decline. First, a number of rigs rolled off of record high day rates from contracts that had been signed during the previous subcycle. Second main factor was unplanned downtime, which was slightly above average compared to better-than-average downtime in the prior quarter.","Demand in the drilling market for mid-water, deepwater and ultra-deepwater rigs remained strong, as indicated by recent contracts signed by Diamond and other drillers. Diamond has entered into new contracts or extended existing contracts with attractive day rates and durations. Also during the third quarter, Diamond announced plans to rebuild the Ocean Apex, a Victory-class semisubmersible rig that will be delivered from the shipyard in Singapore in 2014 at an all-in cost of about $300 million. The Ocean Apex is the last of Diamond's Victory-class rebuilds. There are 9 Victory-class hulls in the world and Diamond owns all 9 of them. These Victory-class hulls have extremely long life spans. And since the mid-1990s, Diamond has used each of these hulls as the base upon which to build a new rig, including all new drilling equipment. The end product is the equivalent of a new-build rig. These Victory-class rebuilds, along with Diamond's other new-build rig acquisitions, are just a few examples of the company's strategy for enhancing its fleet at significantly reduced cost, a strategy that has returned tremendous value to Diamond and to Loews.","The Ocean Apex rebuild follows quickly after that of the Ocean Onyx, another Victory-class hull being rebuilt and scheduled for delivery in 2013. Also, as I've previously discussed, Diamond will take delivery of 4 new-build ultra-deepwater drillships in 2013 and 2014.","Now let's turn to Boardwalk. Boardwalk had a good quarter. Net income attributable to Loews was $20 million compared to $18 million for the third quarter last year. Due to the seasonality of the business, the third quarter is typically Boardwalk's weakest of the year. Best distributions due Loews from Boardwalk during the quarter amounted to $72 million. Boardwalk continues to execute its strategy of diversifying its services and geographic footprint in order to generate growth. The company's recent acquisition of PL Midstream, renamed Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, is an example of Boardwalk driving its diversification strategy forward. The acquisition enables Boardwalk to enter the natural gas liquids storage and distribution business with strategically located and well-contracted assets and a strong, experienced management team.","The acquisition in early October of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, together with the organic growth projects, such as the Southeast market expansion and the Eagle Ford expansion projects, once completed, will result in approximately $1.2 billion of new assets for Boardwalk. Loews initially acquired 65% of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream in early October to assist Boardwalk in the acquisition of the company. In mid-October, just 2 weeks after the closing of that acquisition and subsequent to an equity sale by Boardwalk, Boardwalk then purchased from Loews, Loews' 65% stake in Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream. This transaction worked better than planned as the drop-down occurred sooner than anticipated, which ultimately benefited both Boardwalk and Loews shareholders. This is the second time that Loews has been able to use its balance sheet to help Boardwalk take advantage of a great opportunity, the first being the purchase of HP Storage, which is another recent acquisition for Boardwalk. Loews is ready to help with future transactions that we think will add value to Boardwalk and to Loews.","At HighMount E&P, low natural gas prices continued to impact the company's results. Given the difficult pricing environment, HighMount is currently directing its drilling efforts to locations that should result in higher oil production. These areas include the Mississippian line in Oklahoma and the Wolfcamp strata in Sonora, Texas. Specifically, HighMount has been drilling on the acreage position it acquired last year in the Mississippian line, which is an oil play. HighMount has drilled and completed 12 wells, and initial production rates are comparable to those of other operators in the area. HighMount will continue with this exploratory phase for the next several quarters, and we look forward to sharing additional information about their results as we receive it.","Finally, turning to Loews Hotels & Resorts, we continued to make real progress in our strategy of growing in key urban and resort markets such as the new Loews Hollywood. Additionally, through 2012 and into 2013, Loews will be renovating hotels in 6 key locations. One of these properties will be the Loews Regency in New York, where extensive renovations will begin in early 2013.","Going back to Loews at the holding company level. Loews' investment income increased to $79 million in the third quarter due to improved performance in equity and equity-like investments. This is a $143 million improvement from the $64 million loss that we experienced in the same period in 2011.","As a final point, and before handing the call over to Pete, while you haven't seen us make a large acquisition at the holding company level recently, Loews and its subsidiaries have not been standing still. From 2010 to 2012, Loews and its subsidiaries have committed to projects in excess of $6 billion. These projects include Diamond's 4 new drillships and 2 rebuild semisubmersibles, Boardwalk's recent acquisitions of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream and HP Storage, CNA's acquisitions of Hardy and the remainder of CNA Surety, HighMount's addition of acreage in the Mississippian line and the expansion and renovation activities within Loews Hotels.","Here at the holding company level, we have been helping to facilitate some of these transactions. In addition, during that same time period, the holding company has spent about $1.2 billion in share repurchases. As always, all of these actions are part of our effort to create value over the long term for all Loews shareholders.","Now let me turn the call over to Pete Keegan.","Peter W. Keegan","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $177 million, or $0.45 per share, for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to $162 million, or $0.40 per share, in the third quarter of 2011. As Jim mentioned, net income for the quarter includes a noncash ceiling test impairment charge of $166 million after tax at HighMount Exploration & Production as a result of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquid prices. Income, excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, would have been $343 million as compared to $162 million in the third quarter of 2011. The increase is due primarily to higher earnings at CNA Financial and higher holding company investment income due primarily to increased performance of equity and limited partnership investments. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings at Diamond Offshore.","Income, excluding the ceiling test impairment charge for the first 9 months of 2012 is $936 million as compared to $791 million in the 2011 period. The increase is due primarily to the reasons I just mentioned as well as improved earnings from Boardwalk Pipeline, primarily due to the contribution for Boardwalk HP Storage Company, which was acquired in December 2011, as well as the prior year impact of an impairment charge related to steel pipe materials. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings at Diamond Offshore.","CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the third quarter was a $195 million as compared to $84 million in 2011. CNA's earnings increased due to higher net investment income driven by favorable limited partnership income, improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by decreased favorable net prior year development.","Book value per common share for CNA was $46.99 at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 4% from the end of the second quarter. The increase reflects earnings and improvement in CNA's investment portfolio net unrealized gain position.","Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the third quarter of 2012 was $83 million compared to $121 million in the prior year quarter. Diamond Offshore's earnings decrease resulted primarily from lower rig utilization and a decrease in average day rate, which was partially offset by lower interest expense. Diamond also had lower rig operating costs this quarter.","Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the third quarter increased slightly to $20 million from $18 million in the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily due to storage and transportation revenues earned from HP Storage. In addition, parking and lending revenues increased due to improved market conditions. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in transportation revenue due to lower interruptible service.","At HighMount, excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, net income for the quarter would have been $8 million compared to net income of $16 million in the third quarter of 2011. For the 9 months ended September 2012, HighMount recorded noncash ceiling test impairment charges of $336 million after tax. The ceiling test calculation was based on average 12-month prices of $2.83 per MMBTU for natural gas, $46.02 per barrel for natural gas liquids and $94.97 per barrel for oil.","If prices and reserve levels remain unchanged through 2012, it is likely that HighMount will incur noncash after-tax ceiling test impairments ranging from approximately $50 million to $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 amounting to $386 million to $436 million for the full year.","HighMount's third quarter production volumes and realized prices, which include the benefit of hedges, are as follows: natural gas production was 9.5 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $4.28 per thousand cubic feet, natural gas liquids production was about 590,000 barrels at an average realized price of $37.48 per barrel, and oil production was about 132,000 barrels at an average realized price of $94.71 per barrel. HighMount has hedges in place as of September 30, 2012, to cover approximately 75% of the remaining projected equivalent 2012 production at $5.70 per Mcfe.","Loews Hotels & Resorts recorded a net loss of $1 million as compared to breaking even for the same period in 2011. The decrease is primarily due to increased expenses, including acquisition- and transition-related costs from the Loews Hollywood Hotel. Revenue per available room increased $7.53 to $169.31 for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, as compared to the 2011 period. Occupancy rates increased to 82% in the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, from 79.8% in the 2011 period. Average room rates increased $3.70, or 1.8%, in the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, as compared to the 2011 period.","Holding company cash and investments as of September 30, 2012, totaled $3.8 billion compared to the $3.7 billion held at June 30, 2012.","We received $169 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries and paid $24 million in cash to our shareholders during the third quarter of 2012. We also bought back 2.2 million shares of Loews common stock for $88 million. And now I'll turn the call back over to Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Thanks, Pete. Jackie, at this time, we'd like to open up the discussion for questions. Would you mind repeating the instructions to the participants?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Could you talk about what you're seeing in pricing for transmission lines? And what kind of ROIC you're currently seeing and what do you see kind of long term for returns or what you're looking for long term for returns on transmission pipelines?","James S. Tisch","It all depends -- Michael, it all depends on which pipes you're looking at. It's really a total mixed bag. For LDCs, local distribution companies, and municipalities, there might be one rate. For people that are looking to go on the pipeline superhighway, there might be another rate. And it all depends on -- a lot on location, where the gas is coming from and where it's going to. As a general rule, as you might expect, for lines coming out of Texas and going up to Marcellus, subject to whether other lines service -- provide service for where someone specifically wants to go but the pricing is somewhat weaker than previously because of the increased production in the Marcellus Shale that's being consumed in the Northeast.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Maybe I wasn't clear. I was looking for not the cost to transmit but the cost to purchase lines and the return on investment for -- from your standpoint of purchasing the lines or maybe building new lines.","James S. Tisch","Boardwalk only builds lines when it has commitments that allow it to earn an attractive return on its capital. And if you noticed, in fact the last 2 acquisitions that Boardwalk has made has been in the area of storage, specifically for salt domes to store natural gas and also to store natural gas liquids.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","And what do you calculate or figure was your -- going to be your -- or their return on that storage investment?","James S. Tisch","I don't think that Boardwalk has disclosed a specific anticipated return on investment. But let me just say we think that it's very attractive. And those acquisitions also can lead to very attractive organic growth projects that can have yet even higher returns than the acquisition itself.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","And just a bookkeeping question. What is the current HighMount book value?","James S. Tisch","Pete, do you have that?","Peter W. Keegan","Yes. I think we'll get -- we'll correct it, but I think it's $1.7 right now. I don't have it in front of me, Mike, but I think that's approximately the number.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Pete, one quick question. The number you provided for the implicit full year forecast for the potential HighMount ceiling impairment was slightly less than the most recent update. Is that because natural gas prices in the most recent quarter were somewhat higher?","Peter W. Keegan","Yes. It's a function of all 3 prices, oil, natural gas and liquid prices, plus our estimated level of reserves to track those against. So it's a function of those 4 moving parts. But basically, yes, you're right.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, Jim, anything you can say about sort of the decision framework on the pacing of your share repurchases, both in the third quarter and year-to-date?","James S. Tisch","All I can say is we spent $88 million to buy 2.2 million shares in the third quarter. And as you know, we do not talk about what our plans are for future repurchases.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bunyaner with TLF Capital.","Michael Bunyaner","Just to clarify, Jim, you mentioned that you repurchased 1.2 billion shares -- I'm sorry, $1.2 billion worth of shares. I could not hear what period of time were you quoting.","James S. Tisch","That was from 2010 until the third quarter of 2012. So that was -- in addition to the $6 billion of commitments and capital spending that our subsidiaries have made and that we helped to finance in some cases, Loews has also spent $1.2 billion buying in its own shares.","Michael Bunyaner","Okay. And 2 questions on your operating businesses. In terms of CNA, clearly the environment has improved and the pricing is going in the right direction. But the company is still significantly overcapitalized, at least from the 64,000 feet. How are you thinking about what is the proper capitalization? And does the possible change in the tax laws would affect your decisions or thinking about what that capital should be?","James S. Tisch","Listen, we think CNA is very, very strong. Before we do anything, we want to see the ratings of CNA increased. CNA currently has a claims paying rating from Moody's and Standard and Poor's of A-. We think it should be A. And we are hopeful that soon, that the rating agencies will recognize everything that's been done at CNA and raise its ratings. In terms of capital planning, as you see -- or as you saw 1.5 years ago, CNA started paying dividends, and that's basically the extent of what we've been thinking about in terms of capital planning at CNA.","Michael Bunyaner","One last one, just to follow up. Because the company is improving tremendously, the ROE has increased but is still significantly below 10%. Now some of the business is being run off and the other business is being repriced. Now is the longer-term view that under new management the company can earn significantly more than the cost of capital? Or is there something else that we should be thinking about as it relates to their improvement in operating performance?","James S. Tisch","We don't -- as you know, we don't talk about specific numeric returns on capital that we're looking for or expecting. But there's no doubt that we're hoping to get to higher rates of return. And while we're pleased with the earnings that we're -- we've got, we're not pleased with the rates of return, and you can be sure that the management at CNA is working very, very hard to increase those rates.","Michael Bunyaner","And one other on -- as it relates to HighMount. You were very early in recognizing the fundamental changes in the business. Just share your view of the industry, specifically the glut in NGLs and where we are in terms of the gas business cycle.","James S. Tisch","Sure. Actually, I think gas prices, truth be told, have come back faster than I would have expected. I think that we, as a nation -- first of all, the natural gas picture has changed dramatically over the past 5 years. In the past 5 years, gas has gone from a commodity that was seen to be in shortage, where it traded in '08 at $15 an Mcf, and now it is a commodity that is seen to be in vast abundance. The United States has about, that we know of now, about 100 years' supply of natural gas. As a country, we produce about 65 billion cubic feet per day, and we could increase that production by 50%, in my opinion, with a gas price in the $4 to $4.50 range. So what's needed now for the gas market is just continued demand growth. Demand growth has come over the past several years from the power sector as gas has taken significant market share from coal. But I anticipate in the future that there will be increases in other sectors' demand for gas as well as continued increases in -- from the power sector. I'm also hopeful that over the intermediate term, 3 to 5 years, there will also be significant increases in natural gas coming from the exportation of natural gas. That will -- exporting natural gas will benefit a lot of people. First of all, for every additional 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas that we produce a day, it should increase jobs -- my number is 7,000 to 10,000 jobs per billion cubic feet, permanent jobs. Again, Juergen's [ph] using a number of about 40,000 additional jobs per billion cubic feet. So exploiting gas will improve employment by some significant amount. It will also improve our trade deficit and our current account deficit. So those are all positives. And I believe that this all can be done in an environment where natural gas prices remain under -- remain at about $4.50 per Mcf. It will also be -- one other thing, it also will be very transformative for our economy as we as a nation switch over time, over the next several years, starting with heavy trucks and buses and inner city delivery vehicles from oil and diesel to natural gas. It will be good for the environment. It will be good for our economy. It will bring costs down dramatically. I can see railroads switching from diesel fuel to natural gas. In fact, there are railroads that are already beginning to experiment with that. And when one railroad or one trucker does that, then others will have to follow very quickly because gas trades at such a significant discount to oil. While West Texas Intermediate is about $86 a barrel and international oil, as measured by Brent, is $20 higher, we have natural gas that's trading at under $4 an Mcf, which is the equivalent of less than $25 a barrel. So as I said before, natural gas in the United States in BTUs on the cheap, and the invisible hand of the markets will drive oil consumers to make the switch to natural gas and we will all be better off as a result.","Michael Bunyaner","And in terms of the glut of natural gas liquids?","James S. Tisch","So yes, we do have a lot of natural gas liquids. We've seen a tremendous change in the market for natural gas liquids as ethylene crackers are being -- are on the drawing board and ready for construction. I've seen plans for some people to export LPG. There's just an awful lot that's going on in the natural gas liquids market in order, number one, for consumers to make use of this very attractively priced by-product oils for it to be exported. So there's a lot going on in it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Janney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Your text was -- on natural gas was the same speech you would have given us last quarter. You can quote Patrick [ph] [indiscernible], and he talked about you putting all your gas exploration in abeyance. And then your last thought was almost Boone Pickens in enthusiasm of how good the gas factor could make -- could be from here on the margin. When did -- how much do the gas prices have to go up for you to start exploring more and getting more out? And when does the first -- second half of your speech match to the first part of the speech?","James S. Tisch","So first of all, the comparison with Boone Pickens. I sort of accept that as a compliment. I want to say, though, that I am not calling for the government to fund anything with respect to getting to increase consumption of natural gas. I believe that the free market can do that on its own. With respect to...","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Understood. By the way, I was just referring to enthusiasm of what natural gas can be for this economy.","James S. Tisch","Okay. Then with respect to -- specifically with respect to HighMount, we have an awful lot of gas in the ground at -- in Sonora, Texas. I think right now, it's at least 1 trillion feet. And if gas prices go higher, I think the amount that we have in the ground will go higher because it will become more economic to produce it. There are 2 ways that we could push the button to restart drilling in Sonora. One is if natural gas prices go up. The other is if we can reduce the cost of drilling for natural gas there. And we are looking very, very carefully at how we can drill wells there to get natural gas production at prices that are lower than -- at costs that are lower than historically we have been able to drill for natural gas. So if we're able to do that, if prices go up a bit, then it's possible that we could restart drilling in Sonora, Texas.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess the question is, you didn't want to quantify, but how much do gas prices have to go up before we start seeing more positive contribution to the reported numbers at HighMount? A little, a lot or are we close here?","James S. Tisch","We -- listen, I don't want to give a specific number. But let me just say that right now, we are not at a level where we are -- where it is economic for us to drill for natural gas. But as I said, we are working to see how we can drill for a cheaper price, a cheaper cost, so that the gas production will be economic. And let me just give you some range. We are -- when I talk about these higher prices, I'm not talking about $7 or $8 an Mcf. It's substantially lower than that, but it's also higher than where we are today.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's good enough. CNA talked about pretty clearly how it might work its way through. Obviously, there's a lot going on, and my thoughts to all involved but is there any other sort of elements for the company we need to think about, hotels, or how do you staff and run your New York City hotels? With the subways, you can -- are there more people that stay there or don't stay there? It's probably not a big deal but -- to drill in and of the other segments. But how should we be thinking about implications?","James S. Tisch","I believe we've been through this drill before, through power failures and the like. There is -- especially in times of crisis or emergency, there is an extraordinary esprit de corp. At times like this, guests tend not to expect 4.5 star service. They're happy to have a clean bed in a clean bedroom. And I'm pleased to say that the hotels can provide that and more. And the management of the hotel goes far out of its way. The workers go far out of their way. And they're all able to achieve a product that the guests truly appreciate.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. If no other semi-implications [ph] to the other segments immediately and you've gone through the quarter problems without any issues, I would assume? And...","James S. Tisch","That's right. Yes.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen we have reached our allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mary for any closing remarks.","Mary Skafidas","Great.

But before he does, Jim Tisch, our CEO will kick-off the call. Jim, over to you.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Mary, and good morning. The contrasting fortunes of CNA and Diamond Offshore are the proverbial corporate tale of two cities. Well, not exactly, but almost. While it may be the worst of times for Diamond and the offshore drilling industry, for CNA, we hope and expect to see even more improvement from its already stellar performance.","Let's focus on the positive first and take a look at CNA and the commercial property\/casualty insurance market. CNA has come a long way since 2009 when Tom Motamed first took over as its CEO. Today, CNA is a consistently profitable insurance carrier, with strong operating results and an intense focus on underwriting fundamentals.","As previously announced, Tom will be retiring next month. And today marks his last CNA quarterly conference call, on which I made a surprise cameo appearance to sing his praises. I don't want to say that Tom took CNA from worst to first, but there certainly have been a vast improvement on his watch. And I think it's abundantly clear that this improvement is due to the herculean efforts of Tom and his team.","While, I could spend the entire call listing all of Tom's accomplishments, let's focus on just a few key highlights. During his tenure, Tom has strengthened CNA's branch network, enhanced CNA's competitive position, dramatically upgraded CNA's talent, tremendously improved the commercial lines business, maintained specialty lines preeminent market standing, mitigated operational and financial risks, significantly fortified CNA's balance sheet. And oh yes \u2013 paid out about $2.5 billion of dividends in the past five years.","Tom would be the first one to point out that there is still work to be done. However, the indisputable fact remains that Tom leaves CNA at a time when its capital competitive position and its brand have never been stronger. I want to thank Tom for his many contributions and wish him continued success as he moves on to the next chapter in his life.","And the good news for CNA continues, with the arrival of Dino Robusto as the company's new CEO next month. Dino will take the helm on November 21, when his garden leave officially comes to an end.","I'm confident that I speak for the rest of the CNA board when I say how much we look forward to working with Dino. The CNA which Dino inherits is poised for continued improvement and further value creation. And we fully believe that Dino and the CNA team will fulfill that potential.","Alas, all of life cannot be light and happiness. And with that in mind, let's move on to Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling industry, where they are experiencing the aforementioned worst of times. It's clear that this industry is facing one of the sharpest downturns in its history with canceled contracts, below operating cost day rates and customers seemingly unwilling to take advantage of these discounts.","Despite the pain, Diamond Offshore's CEO Marc Edwards and his team continue to navigate these troubled waters with tireless focus, skill and determination. Just in the past few weeks, Marc has been in Singapore, Australia, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro and France, not to mention New York and Houston, all in the quest of maintaining and generating business for Diamond Offshore. And while the offshore drilling industry continues to operate in a depressed environment, the price of oil, the commodity to which the offshore drilling industry is most closely tied, seems to have begun its recovery.","At the beginning of this year, oil dropped to about $27 a barrel, a new low in recent history. Two weeks ago, oil was nearly double that price at almost $52 a barrel and while oil prices may have partially recovered, day rates for offshore drilling rigs certainly have not. I'm hopeful that within the next several quarters, we'll start to see an uptick in inquiries for offshore drilling rigs, a necessary precursor to improved day rates in the future.","While there are still many unknowns with regard to the oil and energy markets today, we have no doubt that Diamond Offshore will withstand this tough cyclical downturn. Diamond's innovative strategies along with its financial strength, conservative capital management and stellar management team should enable the company to emerge from this turbulent market cycle, stronger and more resilient than ever.","Before I turn the call over to David Edelson, I wanted to mention that Jon Tisch has resumed the duties of CEO of Loews Hotels. Many of you may know that Kirk Kinsell has decided to leave the company. Loews Hotels is in strong shape and the Loews Hotels team looks forward to building on the strong base already in place. The company is in great hands with Jon, who has been shepherding the expansion and strategic direction of Loews Hotels for the past 30 years.","And now, over to David.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Jim, and good morning.","For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $327 million or $0.97 per share, as compared to net income of $182 million or $0.50 per share in last year's third quarter.","The year-over-year increase in our third quarter earnings came almost entirely from higher contributions from CNA Financial and from the parent company investment portfolio.","Let me start by walking through the key drivers of our year-over-year quarterly improvement. For your information, these key drivers are set forth on page 12 of our Q3 2015 earnings supplement, which can be found on loews.com.","The first key driver was net investment income, both at the parent company and at CNA. The parent company portfolio generated a pre-tax gain of $36 million in Q3 2016 versus a pre-tax loss of $35 million last year. The gain was driven by alternative investments and gold-related equities while last year's loss was primarily caused by equities including gold-related equities and alternatives. The $71 million pre-tax improvement accounted for a $46 million after-tax improvement year-over-year.","At CNA, the year-over-year swing in net investment income of $170 million pre-tax was driven by LP investments, which swung from a $93 million pre-tax loss in Q3 2015 to a $65 million gain this past quarter. This $158 million pre-tax swing resulted in a $92 million increase in net income at the Loews level.","The second key driver was the meaningful improvement in CNA's Life & Group segment, which swung from a $30 million after-tax loss in last year's third quarter to net operating income of $6 million this year. This $36 million year-over-year improvement was mostly attributable to the long-term care reserve unlocking at year-end 2015 that reset the underlying actuarial assumptions on the long-term care reserves. The turnaround in CNA's Life & Group segment accounted for a $32 million increase in net income at the Loews' level.","The third key driver was realized investment gains and losses at CNA. CNA posted pre-tax realized gains of $46 million in Q3 2016 versus realized losses of $49 million in last year's third quarter. This $95 million pre-tax improvement accounted for $56 million of the year-over-year increase in Loews' third quarter net income. The fourth and fifth key drivers partially offset the first three positives.","CNA's P&C underwriting income was down year-over-year as CNA's combined ratio rose from 85.7% in Q3 2015 to 90.4% this past quarter. Let me pause and simply note that both of these combined ratios are extremely strong and result in substantial underwriting income. As a reminder, underwriting income reflects earned premium, less the sum of losses, loss adjustment expenses and acquisition and underwriting expenses.","While CNA's accident year loss ratio, including cat losses, was a solid 62.8% in both periods, the company booked 11 points of favorable prior year development last year against eight points this year. Also, CNA incurred higher expenses attributable to both ongoing and non-recurring costs. The combination of less favorable development and higher expenses caused CNA's P&C underwriting income to decline $73 million pre-tax year-over-year, accounting for a $43 million decline in net income at the Loews' level.","The last key driver was the substantial year-over-year fall-off in Diamond's operating results. With fewer working rigs and elevated unscheduled downtime, Diamond's contract drilling revenue declined 43% year-over-year and its net income dropped to $14 million from $136 million in last year's third quarter. At the Loews' level, Diamond's contribution to our net income fell $40 million from $47 million in Q3 2015 to $7 million this past quarter.","These five drivers, net investment income, CNA's Life & Group segment, realized investment results at CNA, CNA's P&C underwriting income, and Diamond's operating results, netted to a positive $143 million after-tax, essentially accounting for the $145 million year-over-year increase in Loews' third quarter net income.","Let me now briskly walk through our earnings by business segment. CNA contributed $308 million to our net income in Q3 2016, $281 million of net operating income and $27 million of realized investment gains. This compares to $161 million in the third quarter of 2015, net operating income of $190 million and $29 million of realized investment losses.","As I've already mentioned, the key drivers of the net operating income improvement were net investment income, specifically returns on LP investments, and improved results in the Life & Group segment, partially offset by the decline in P&C underwriting income.","Before leaving CNA, I must highlight CNA's progress in generating underwriting profit. CNA posted a 90.4 combined ratio in the third quarter and 94.6 year-to-date. All three P&C businesses, specialty, commercial and international, posted sub-100 combined ratios in the quarter. As Jim noted, under Tom's leadership, CNA has made tremendous strides.","Onto Diamond, Diamond contributed $7 million to our net income in Q3 2016, down from $47 million last year. Diamond itself posted net income of $14 million versus $136 million in Q3 2015. Let me remind you that in last year's third quarter, we wrote up $20 million of goodwill associated with our carrying value of Diamond. Without this goodwill charge, Diamond's contribution to our Q3 2015 net income would have been $67 million.","We have discussed the difficult conditions in the offshore drilling market previously, and Jim just mentioned them. And these conditions showed no signs of abating in the third quarter. Contract drilling revenues in Q3 were down 43% on a 44% decline in revenue earning days. The bulk of the revenue decline was attributable to pure rigs working this year versus last year.","Additionally, the company experienced unscheduled downtime due to unanticipated customer and operational issues. I would note that Diamond continues to be the highest rated company in the offshore drilling space. The company's liquidity position is solid with $1.3 billion available today under its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, no debt maturities until 2019 and no capital expenditure commitments for undelivered rates.","Turning to Boardwalk. The company posted a strong third quarter as net revenues were up 6% year-over-year, EBITDA was up 9% and net income was up 23%. The main drivers of Boardwalk's strong revenue quarter, which flow through to EBITDA and net income, were favorable natural gas transportation, primarily from growth projects and improved revenues from parking and lending and storage.","Please note that a reconciliation of Boardwalk's EBITDA to its net income can be found in its Q3 earnings release. Despite Boardwalk's strong quarter, you can see that its contribution to our net income declined by $4 million year-over-year. The reason is that in last year's third quarter, Loews benefited from a $6 million after-tax franchise tax refund related to Boardwalk. Excluding this non-recurring item at the Loews' level, Boardwalk's net income contribution was up $2 million from the prior year.","As you know, Boardwalk is undertaking various growth projects to position it for the future. The company recently placed into service four projects that represent approximately $320 million in CapEx. An additional $1.2 billion of projects are underway and expected to be placed into service between now and 2018. We are pleased that the four projects placed in service in 2016 came in approximately 9% below budget, reflecting management's keen focus on project execution.","Finally, S&P recently raised the issue level ratings on Boardwalk's unsecured debt, including its revolving credit facility from BB+ to BBB-. This means that all of Boardwalk's senior debt now carries investment grade ratings from each of the major rating agencies.","Let me now touch on Loews Hotels, which contributed net income of $3 million, up from $2 million in the third quarter of 2015. The company's adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was $37 million, up from $30 million in Q3 2015. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income can be found in our Q3 2016 earnings supplement.","Contributing to the increase in adjusted EBITDA were improved results across the chain, including the Loews Regency New York and the Orlando properties, offset somewhat by muted results at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel, which is under renovation. Third quarter results were also negatively impacted by pre-opening expenses related to the new 1,000-room Loews Sapphire Falls in Orlando, which opened in July.","Turning to the parent company. As previously mentioned, the parent company investment portfolio generated after-tax income of $24 million compared with a loss of $22 million in the prior year quarter. At quarter end, the parent company portfolio totaled $5 billion, broken down as follows: just over 60% in cash and short-term investments, 17% in limited partnership investments, another 9% in marketable equity securities and the bulk of the remainder in fixed maturities. We maintain a large and liquid portfolio of cash and investments for two mutually reinforcing reasons, to enable us to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves and to help mitigate risk during tough times.","Capital deployment opportunities can take such forms as acquiring new businesses, helping our subsidiaries pursue their strategies and repurchasing our shares. Our liquidity combined with a relatively low-level of parent company debt and the extended maturity schedule of that debt give us valuable optionality and protection.","During the third quarter, we've received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $61 million from CNA and $13 million for Boardwalk. Year-to-date, we have received total dividends of $706 million combined from CNA and Boardwalk.","Our share repurchase activity since last quarter has been modest. We repurchased 440,000 shares from July 1 through this first Friday, spending approximately $17 million. Year-to-date, we have spent approximately $115 million in repurchasing 3 million shares. Average shares outstanding were 338 million in the third quarter, down 6.5% from 361 million in Q3 2015.","And with that, I'll now hand the call back to Mary.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Thank you, David. Paula, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for your questions. Your first question comes from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning, Loews team. Quick question on Hotels. Is there a search on place for a permanent CEO, or is Jon going to be approved?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So, Jon is currently the CEO, and we're very happy with the way it's running like that. So, that's where it is.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. Your year-to-date share repurchase of 3 million shares, I went back to 2007, that's the least active you've been through nine months for at least that long, if not longer. I'm curious, you mentioned \u2013 I think, David mentioned in the press release, acquisitions are a possibility. Years back, you said that the acquisitions were expensive and not that interesting, although you're kicking a lot of tires all the time. Wondering if you could sort of \u2013 where are we in your desire or need or opportunity to do a deal?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","We are completely unchanged in terms of our desire or need to do a deal. We kicked \u2013 as I've said previously, we kicked lots of tires. We look at lots of things. We do due diligence and explore different options. But to-date, we haven't found anything in the past few years that fully makes sense for us at a price that also makes sense for us. But in terms of desire or need, that's not a factor in our looking at businesses, nor in setting prices for them. The sole thing that we think about when evaluating different opportunities is whether we believe it will create a good value over the intermediate-term to long-term for those shareholders. And on that score, I admit we've been wholly unsuccessful in executing a transaction, but you can be sure that we put 100% of our effort into looking for that transaction.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Am I over analyzing, Jimmy, by just connecting the dots of no share repurchase and I thought David mentioning acquisitions in his text for the first time in a while. When you put those two dots, connect those two dots, the chance that you're looking at a deal certainly seems to be a possibility for explaining it.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Over the years, I would say that trying to evaluate what we're thinking in terms of share repurchases by looking at what we've done is akin to looking at the entrails or the tea leaves. It's just there is no one factor that can fully describe or explain why does we buy or don't buy \u2013 repurchase our shares.","When we think about share repurchases, there are an enormous number of factors that go into the equation: there's the price of Loews, there's the price of our subsidiaries, the value that we ascribe to our non-public businesses. There are times when even if we want to buy in the shares for one reason or another we're not allowed to repurchase the shares. There is what's going on in the wider market, both the market for interest rates and the market for shares. And there's not just what's going on today but our outlook for the future.","So, we put all of these factors and more into our own special computer, which is collectively the brains of a few people around here, and we discuss it and decide what to do with respect to share repurchases. Like acquisitions, the one factor that drives us in determining whether to repurchase shares or not is our assessment of how it will contribute to the intermediate-term to long-term value for the remaining Loews' shareholders. So, it's all a long way of saying that we look at lots and lots of factors in determining whether to purchase shares.","And as I'd like to say, we have a long and glorious history of share repurchases where we have, I think, 80% of the shares outstanding \u2013 sorry, 20% \u2013 30% of the shares outstanding today that we had in the 1970s. And just since 2007, we've purchased 40% of the shares outstanding in 2007. So, my advice, try not to make too much of what we do one quarter or one year, look at the long-term picture because that's what we're looking at as well.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Your answer hasn't changed too much over the last quarter century. Thank you.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Dank.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. I've more hard questions about acquisitions and whatnot. Is there an overarching philosophy \u2013 Buffet says that he wants to be the buyer of choice for things and never sell anything. So when you think about Diamond, whether \u2013 when shares were at $100, do you have the rightsize holding in Diamond? Now that shares are at $20, do you have the rightsize holding? I mean, you could buy the whole thing, and you'd still have less of a stake in the overall Loews' empire than it was back when the stock was more pricy. How should we think of what the right amount of Diamond or any other stock for that matter that Loews should be owning?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So, we're very happy with our ownership in Diamond. A fun fact is that from 2006 to today, Diamond has paid more than twice the current share price of Diamond in dividends. So, we and all other Diamond shareholders, since 2006, have gotten over $40 in dividends from Diamond. I'm pleased to say that, notwithstanding those dividends, Diamond is still in very good, very strong financial shape.","In terms of our desire to acquire more Diamond shares, I don't want to comment on it, because we'll let our actions speak for themselves. But I can just tell you that we are very pleased with our current level of holdings in Diamond Offshore. And there's no doubt in my mind that when as and if the offshore drilling market improves and shares of Diamond follow that that Loews' shareholders will be beneficiaries of it.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, putting it another way, is there correct amount of Loews capital that should be exposed to the energy sector, and are you below that? Or was there ever a thought that at a certain point maybe in retrospect you realize that at peak pricing maybe the capital was overexposed, but how does that calculus go into your thinking of the rightsize the holding?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So, we don't feel a need to be invested in energy. We happen to have significant investments in energy as denoted by our shares of Diamond and our shares of Boardwalk. And we are very happy with those investments. We think that they will return very good returns for our shareholders over the coming years. But like I said, we don't feel that we have to be in energy per se or that we have to add to our investments in energy.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But for an investment you already have at the right price, you would not be against it?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Say again?","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","At the right price, you wouldn't be against owning more of something you already have that you know very well?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","That's not what I said. I'm saying that we're very comfortable with what we own now, and I'm not stating whether or not we want to own more now or in the future.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, all right. I'll let it rest. In the non-controlling parts of the investment portfolio, what are the benchmarks that you're using to determine whether or not you're being successful in bond investing and whatnot? Is there \u2013 and then, do you think that you've done a good job and how do you measure it?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So, are you referring primarily to the CNA investment portfolio or without...?","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, that would be CNA and the $5 billion or so of change you have over at Loews?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So, we're constantly comparing both those portfolios to different indices of performance. At CNA, I would say there is less latitude for significant outperformance because we have very strict benchmarks of the amount of equity like and equity-like investments that we can have at CNA. So most of the portfolio is investment grade. And also, we have important guidelines for duration for the different portfolios within CNA. So that when we measure the performance of CNA versus the benchmarks that we use to measure the performance, outperformance could mean a 100 basis points of outperformance. So, the numbers aren't \u2013 the numbers are \u2013 in terms of outperformance aren't that significant.","With respect to our non-investment grade investments and our equity investments at Loews and at CNA, we use all manner of different indices. We look at hedge fund returns, industry hedge fund returns. We look at high yield bond returns. We look at equity returns. And overall I would say that we are very pleased with the returns that we've had in all our portfolios. Yes, from time to time, we see underperformance in one portfolio or another, but like I said, overall we're very pleased with where we are.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then, coming back to Bob's question. Is there any time that you didn't necessarily have a large acquisition in mind but you preferred to make investment in the non-controlling area of Loews rather than use the cash to buy back stock?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Wait, repeat that again.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Is there a period of time when you're not looking to take a controlling stake in the business but you do find something out there in the market that's attractive from a non-controlling perspective that would keep you from buying your own shares?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","That generally doesn't happen.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","My pleasure.","Operator","At this time, there are no further audio questions. I will turn the floor back over to Mary for any pre-submitted questions.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Great. Thank you, Paula. We do have a few questions from our shareholders. The first one has to do with capital allocation. Jim, when allocating capital, how do you think about share repurchases versus other investments?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So, I guess, I think I already answered the question vis-\u00e0-vis our share repurchases. Let me just talk about how we think about buying businesses for Loews. And a benchmark that we use is, whether an acquisition would be accretive in terms of value over the intermediate to long-term for all our shareholders. As I've said before and I'll say it again, there are things we do look at and other things that we don't look at. The things we don't look at are things where a bad CEO in the course of a year or two could cause tremendous damage to a business. So, we tend not to look at retailing businesses, we tend not to look at businesses where a technological disruption could be an important factor. We tend not to look at technology businesses, where if you miss one relatively quick cycle in terms of the technology, you could be out of business.","So we're looking for businesses that we believe can stand the test of time and be with us for a long time to create value. We're also generally looking for businesses that are based here in the United States. They could have international operations, but we'd like them to be based here in the U.S. And, as I said before, we've kicked an awful lot of tires. We've gone down the path pretty far with a number of businesses. But, in recent history, we haven't been able to close anything. When we think about buying businesses versus share repurchases, that's an important comparison that we make. We think about what is the future for Loews with the business and what would be the future of Loews without the business. And we think whether \u2013 we think how compelling it is to repurchase shares at any point in time versus the value that we can get in buying a business that we don't already control. And we're also \u2013 think very carefully about what we don't know concerning any business that we might buy. And we compare that to what we do know about our own businesses that we own and control with respect to share repurchases.","There's no given formula that we use in assessing repurchases \u2013 purchases of businesses, just as there's no formula that we use in assessing whether to repurchase shares. But I would say that what we're doing is generally what any other portfolio manager does when they think about adding new securities to their portfolio. That's how I was trained. That's how a lot of people here were trained. And that's how we think about buying new businesses, repurchasing our own shares or investing in any of our individual businesses.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Jim. That was very helpful. The next question has to do with CNA. Even though CNA had another strong quarter, it's still trading at such a discount to its book value per share. What do you think accounts for that discount?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","I think there are a number of things that accounts for the discount to book value per share. First of all, CNA stock \u2013 CNA shares have moved up rather significantly, almost 20%, in the past few months or quarters. And I ascribe that to the fact that people are starting to recognize that CNA is a changed company, that it's got underwriting discipline, all the things that I spoke about with respect to my comments about Tom and CNA. Additionally, I think, a very important factor is that people are starting to see that the dividend that CNA has paid out, which is for the past two years at least have totaled $3 a share, makes it that at $30 a share. CNA was trading at a 10% yield, which is just too high a yield to be passed off.","So I think that the 20% improvement over the past several quarters has been a recognition of those factors. I think a problem for people investing in CNA is that there is not significant liquidity. Loews owns 90% of CNA. We don't worry about the price from day-to-day, week-to-week or month-to-month. But the assuming lack of liquidity, I think, has kept a number of large purchasers from CNA.","I think the other reason is that some people might be concerned about the long-term care book of business. I would say that we, at Loews, are very comfortable with it, but there's no doubt that some investors may be scared off a bit by it. The thing that \u2013 the thing that I would say is that the long-term care book of business at CNA is being very aggressively managed in terms of the attention that it is get \u2013 the management attention that it is getting and the focus on the part of senior management. I think all that and who knows what other factors may be out there that are affecting the overall valuation of CNA.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Great. Wonderful. Thank you, Jim.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Jim and David. That's all the time we have for today. And thank you all, always for your continued interest in Loews.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Loews Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mary Skafidas, Vice President of Investor and Public Relations. Please go ahead.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to Loews Corporation Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of our earnings release may be found on our website, loews.com.","On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, Peter Keegan. Following their prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward-looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those projections made in any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made, and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is only a brief summary of the company's statutory forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included in the company's filings with the SEC.","During the call today, we might also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our security filings for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.","I will now turn the call over to Loews' Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch.","James S. Tisch","Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Loews' second quarter results. As you know by now, we reported earnings of $56 million for the quarter, as compared to $250 million of Loews earned in the second quarter of 2011. Net income for the quarter includes after-tax, noncash fueling test impairment charges of $142 million at HighMount, related to the carrying value of its natural gas properties. These charges were the results of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquids pricing.","Loews ended the second quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and investments at the holding company level. This quarter, we spent approximately $51 million buying back about 1.3 million shares of Loews' stock.","During the second quarter, Moody's Investors Service upgraded by 1 notch the senior unsecured ratings of Loews, CNA Financial and Diamond Offshore. According to Moody's, Loews' upgrade to A2 reflects the strengthening credit profile of our primary operating subsidiaries and our standalone financial strength and conservative financial policies.","Moody's also affirmed the CNA insurance company's financial strength ratings and revised the outlook on these ratings to positive from stable. So now, both Moody's and S&P have CNA's financial strength on positive outlook, which is a real credit to the progress that's being made by the management team at CNA.","In addition to the good news from the rating agencies, CNA had a solid quarter, which was favorably impacted by lower catastrophe losses and improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results. Lower net investment income from CNA's limited partnership investments created a drag on an otherwise strong improvement in net operating income. ELP investment produced a second quarter pretax loss of $35 million in 2012 as compared to pretax income of $11 million in 2011.","The combined ratio for the P&C operations, excluding catastrophe losses in prior year development, improved by nearly 3 points versus last year's second quarter. Also, the reported combined ratio improved by 4.3 points to 101.7 during the second quarter.","CNA continues to close the underwriting performance gap with its best-in-class competitors. There's more work to be done, and we look forward to CNA continuing its steady progress towards becoming a top-tier industry performer.","In July, CNA closed its acquisition of Hardy Underwriting, a specialized Lloyd's underwriter with a solid market reputation and a long history of disciplined underwriting. This acquisition will provide CNA with a key platform for international growth. Hardy's results would be included in CNA's and Loews' third quarter results.","Turning to Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling market. Diamond had a solid quarter despite its net income being down by about $60 million versus last year's second quarter. The biggest driver of the decline was that Diamond had 5 rigs in the shipyard this quarter for the 5-year special surveys compared to none during the same period last year. It's worth mentioning that despite the drop in oil prices, the offshore drilling market continues to show real strength. We believe that Diamond is well positioned to take advantage of these market conditions, given its rig availability over the coming 2 to 3 years.","Recent contracts signed by Diamond and other drillers for mid-water, deepwater and ultra-deepwater rigs indicate that demand is strong.","Diamond continues to focus on modernizing its fleet. As a reminder, Diamond has 4 ultra-deepwater drillships under construction in Korea. Earlier in '09, Diamond purchased 2 ultra-deep waters semisubmersibles in bankruptcy options. And most recently, Diamond is reconstructing an older semisubmersible into a high spec drilling unit to be named the Ocean Onyx. The rig was recently awarded a 1-year contract at a rate of $490,000 per day to work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico upon delivery from the shipyard in the third quarter of 2013.","Diamond is actively considering another project similar to the Ocean Onyx that should provide the company with very attractive returns. The cost of this fleet renewal since '09 announced to -- amounts to almost $4 billion.","Now let's turn to Boardwalk. While Boardwalk had a good quarter, the market fundamentals of its base business remain challenging. Sustaining low natural gas prices, compressed basis spreads and now with seasonal spreads are making it difficult for Boardwalk to grow its base business. In light of this, Boardwalk has prudently decided to hold distribution steady in this quarter rather than raise the payout. This action will help Boardwalk strengthen its balance sheet as it continues to focus on long-term growth prospects.","We remain bullish on Boardwalk over the long term. Stan Horton and his team are not standing still. They have a number of projects in the works that should enhance the company's prospects.","At HighMount E&P, low natural gas prices continue to impact the company's results and produce -- primarily a producer of natural gas. Given the difficult environment for natural gas, HighMount is scaling up its efforts to produce more oil.","In the Permian Basin, HighMount has put dry gas development activity on hiatus and is focusing on drilling Wolfcamp Shale wells that have high oil potential. Additionally, HighMount is now starting to drill for oil on the land it acquired last year in the Mississippian line in Oklahoma. And we are hopeful about seeing significant oil production from this property.","Overall, we are encouraged by HighMount's efforts to pursue projects that have the potential to diversify its product mix and generate high returns in the current environment.","As you know, for the second quarter, HighMount recorded a noncash ceiling test impairment charge. As I said last quarter, by it bears repeating, ceiling test impairment charges are mandated by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and not because the gas is no longer in the ground. I continue to be a firm believer that we will see a continuing increase in gas consumption in the U.S., and we remain optimistic about natural gas usage and pricing over the long term.","Finally, turning to Loews Hotels and resorts. Paul Whetsell continues to make progress on this growth program. Let me point the 3 recent examples: number one, during the second quarter, Loews Hotels acquired Loews Hollywood in Los Angeles, which has 632 guestrooms and 48,000 square feet of meeting space. This should be a great property for Loews Hotels and its customers; number two, Loews Hotels announced earlier this month that the Regency hotel in New York will undergo an extensive renovation during 2013. The renovation is designed to ensure that the Regency will continue to offer unmatched contemporary comfort while maintaining its renowned standard of hospitality and service; and number three, Loews Hotels and Universal announced the Cabanna Bay Beach Resort, a newer hotel development at Universal Orlando with 1,800 rooms offering both modern and value-priced accommodations. This resort will be operated by Loews Hotels and is scheduled to open in 2014.","At the holding company level, Loews' investment income declined in the second quarter as compared to the same period in 2011. This decrease was due to lower performance of limited partnerships and equity investments for the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2012.","Finally, before I turn the call over to Pete, while you haven't seen us make any acquisitions at the holding company level recently, you may have noticed that there's been no shortage of activity at our subsidiaries, whether it's Diamond Offshore seizing an opportunity to upgrade its fleet or Loews Hotels adding and upgrading assets in profitable Florida, California and New York City markets or CNA expanding its global footprint with its acquisition of Hardy, Loews' subsidiaries have been making attractive, strategic acquisitions. And we, at the holding company level, have been helping to facilitate some of these transactions. We continue to be pleased with, and involved in, each of our subsidiaries future prospects and will continue to focus on creating value over the long term for all Loews' shareholders.","Now let me turn the call over to Pete.","Peter W. Keegan","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $56 million or $0.14 per share for the second quarter of 2012 as compared to $250 million or $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2011.","As Jim mentioned, net income for the quarter includes a noncash, ceiling test impairment charge of $142 million after-tax at HighMount Exploration & Production, as a result of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquid prices.","Excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, Loews' net income for 2012 would have been $198 million as compared to $250 million in the second quarter of 2011. The change is due primarily to lower earnings of Diamond Offshore Drilling and decreased performance of equity and limited partnership investments at the parent company. These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings of CNA Financial and Boardwalk Pipeline partners.","CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the second quarter was $138 million as compared to $101 million in 2012 -- in 2011. Period-over-period comparisons were favorable due to lower catastrophe losses, improved underwriting results and premium rate increases in CNA's core P&C operations, as well as lower losses in its run-off businesses. Results were partially offset by lower net investment income due to decreased limited partnership results.","CNA continues to sustain positive rate momentum across its P&C portfolio. A 6% rate increase in the quarter, which was up 2 points from the 4% CNA reported in the first quarter and up 5 points from the second quarter last year.","Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the second quarter of 2012 was $94 million compared to $125 million in the prior year's quarter. Diamond Offshore's earnings decrease resulted primarily from lower rig utilization as more rigs were undergoing special surveys, the decrease in average day rate and an increase in contract drilling expenses, reflecting the costs of the special surveys. These decreases were partially offset by a $23 million gain after-tax and noncontrolling interests from the sale of 5 jacked up rigs in the second quarter of 2012.","Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the second quarter increased to $25 million from $5 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in net income was due to the absence of a $28 million materials and supplies impairment charge from the 2011 period, as well as higher transportation and storage-related revenues and the contribution of HP Storage operating results, which was acquired in just December 2011.","HighMount recorded a net loss of $139 million for the second quarter of 2012 compared to net income of $15 million in the second quarter of 2011. The lower results were due to the noncash cost centers ceiling test impairment charge of $142 million after-tax related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties, as well as decreased sales volumes stemming from the reduction in drilling activity and declines in natural gas and NGL prices. Excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, net income for the quarter would have been $3 million.","For the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2012, HighMount reported noncash ceiling test impairment charges of $142 million and $170 million after-tax. The ceiling test calculation was based on average 12-month prices of $3.15 per MMBTU for natural gas and $51.59 per barrel of natural gas liquids and $95.67 per barrel of oil.","The price and reserve levels remain unchanged through 2012. It is likely that HighMount will incur noncash and after-tax ceiling test impairments ranging from approximately $230 million to $280 million for the remainder of 2012, amounting to $400 million to $450 million for the full year of 2012.","HighMount's second quarter production volumes and realized prices, which include the benefit of hedges, are as follows: natural gas production was 10.1 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $3.89 per 1,000 cubic feet; natural gas liquid production was 582,000 barrels at an average realized price of $38.38 per barrel; and oil production was 101,000 barrels at an average realized price of $89.01 per barrel.","HighMount has hedges in place as of June 30, 2012, that cover approximately 66% of the remaining projected equivalent 2012 production at $5.49 per Mcfe.","At Loews Hotels, net incomes remain flat at $6 million for the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter the previous year. Revenue per available room increased $6.49 to $182.08 for the second quarter of 2012 as compared to the 2011 period. The increase in revenue per available room reflects improving occupancy and average room rates. Holding company cash investments as of June 30, 2012, totaled $3.7 billion, the same amount held at March 31, 2012. We received $173 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries, and paid $25 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the second quarter of 2012.","We also provided $43 million to Loews Hotels for the acquisition of its Hollywood property and bought back 1.3 million shares of Loews' common stock for $51 million.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Peter. Jackie, at this time, I would like to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","You guys have spoiled me over the years with a very good long-term record and how your partnerships have generated excess returns. So I'm not questioning that. But just looking at the year-to-date -- your investment income at the parent is negative $6 million. And that's in a stock market that's up 8% through the first 6 months and a bond market that was very strong. Is it fair to say that maybe your position for rates to go higher or was there something else that generated the subpar returns year-to-date?","James S. Tisch","I would just say, it was more about not being in the strong sectors of the stock market. We didn't really have any significant bets in fixed income. And part of the problem is that cash earned were pretty close to 0, so you don't get any benefit from -- to your income statement for having cash. So this was all about just being in the wrong sectors in the stock market.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","I think you've made some public comments about the relative lack of attractiveness of bonds, and bonds have rallied. So I'm just surmising that maybe you have more of a negative bet towards fixed income than you traditionally had? Or is that not factored into the partnership or parent income at all?","James S. Tisch","We are -- first of all, we are not short in the bond market, but the partnerships that we've invested in the quarter, as you saw at CNA, were down. And the market for -- even though -- first of all, I think as of June, the market was not up very much -- at the end of June, as of July 1. And I think that the problem is the market is pretty directionless. And so it's been difficult, I think, for all participants in the equity markets to generate returns.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. And any -- it seems like the subsidiaries are doing a lot which suggests that you're not so bearish about the macro environment in total. But the parent is not doing much either on your own stock or elsewhere. So where are you on the global economy? Things are fine or are you concerned?","James S. Tisch","I'm very concerned. And in fact, I find it actually quite extraordinary that we find ourselves with attractive investment opportunities at the subsidiary level in view of just how poorly, I think, the U.S. economy and the global economy is doing. I think that's driven by the fact that each one of our individual businesses has been able to find attractive bolt-on acquisitions that we hope will generate very attractive returns for us. But in the United States, we've got 1.5% economic growth. The Eurozone is not growing. The emerging markets are not emerging as fast as they had been before. And nobody -- you don't see anybody really expressing optimism about what's going on in the economy either here in the United States or overseas. So for a whole host of reasons, I don't see growth picking up any time soon. But having said that, I'm very pleased with the opportunities that we're seeing in our individual businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of things. First, do you think that the moderate pace of parent company share repurchases over the last several quarters played a part in, or contributed to, the credit rating upgrade of Loews?","James S. Tisch","No, I don't think so. I think this is a long time coming. They have rated us A2. Just for a little perspective, we have $700 million of debt and we have $3.7 billion of cash and investments. So our cash and investments covers our debt by a factor of 5x. I do not know what we need to do to get an upgrade from here. But it just seems that the metrics for an upgrade on Loews debt is crazy, and this one was long overdue. But again, I think of Loews as a AA-rated company.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Secondly, can you give us a sense of the status of the drilling program on the newly acquired HighMount properties? How much -- how long has it been going on? What are the early learnings? And how did they -- how are they relative to the expectations by this point?","James S. Tisch","So we've just started in the past several months, in the Mississippian lime. It took some time because permitting work and disposal well drilling that we had to do. And I'm hopeful that in the next quarter, we'll be able to report some preliminary results that we're seeing there, as well as possibly report on how we're doing in the Wolfcamp zone, so we're drilling in the Permian Basin in our Sonora properties.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick question on the hotels, maybe for Pete. Were there large or material one-off costs associated with the acquisition during the quarter? Because I'm just curious, revenue's up $5 million, operating income is basically flat.","Peter W. Keegan","No. There were not material costs related to that. There were some, but they weren't material.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So why isn't -- and again, it's obviously not your biggest business, but why isn't that division, overall, demonstrating operating leverage?","Peter W. Keegan","Well, they are showing some improvement, but the rounding, you lose it at the moment. But going forward, I hope to see some more improvement.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baker with Barclays.","Andrew Baker","Jim, just a question. You mentioned earlier, again talking about your confidence in the rebound of natural gas prices over time, as you go to increased utilization there. Obviously, the forward curve always -- just had been consistently wrong in the short term, obviously. In the long term, things have yet to play out. I'm just wondering, are there ways you can position yourself or investments you can make now based on valuations in the market with gas down where it is, such that you'd be positioned not just to, sort of, have HighMount to return to the levels that we're looking at when it was first acquired, but also to benefit from getting it at the low levels as well.","James S. Tisch","So first of all, gas is actually been staging a pretty significant rally. The 12-month strip in the past 4 or 5 months is up about, I think, $0.90 -- hold on 1 second. The strip is up to $3.56, whereas in April, it was about $1 lower. So there has been a significant rally in gas prices already. Spike gas prices, last I looked, about just under $3.20 an Mcf. Just as a reminder, that's the equivalent to about $19 a barrel of oil. So even though gas has had a significant rally, it is still very, very cheap relative to oil. And at the $3.20 level, it's still at a price where, for most people drilling for natural gas -- for dry gas, it is generally uneconomic to drill at these prices. So we've seen the rig count -- the natural gas rig count in the past year or so virtually cut in half as people are laying down natural gas rigs. I think that the rally in natural gas has already started, but it still has a ways to go. And I think, as I've said before on these calls, I think that the steady state equilibrium price for natural gas in the United States is probably somewhere between $4 and $4.50 an Mcf. We have, at HighMount, we've been looking to diversify our portfolio. We have plenty of gas in the ground that can be produced at higher natural gas prices. And so we've been -- we have acquired, last year, properties that we think are rich in oil. And our drilling programs have been focused on drilling for oil and natural gas liquids. And so we are moving to diversify HighMount away from just being focused on natural gas.","Operator","Thank you. That was our final question. And I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mary for any closing remarks.","Mary Skafidas","Great. Thank you, Jackie, and thank you, all, for your continued interest. A replay will be available in our website, loews.com, in approximately 2 hours. And that concludes today's call.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"12885":["Loews Corporation (NYSE:L) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call February 11, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Mary Skafidas - Head of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations","Jim Tisch - Chief Executive Officer","David Edelson - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Loews Corporation Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Mary Skafidas to begin.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Laurie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Loews Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. A copy of our earnings release, earnings supplement and company overview, may be found on our website, loews.com. On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Edelson.","Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session, which will include questions from our shareholders.

Please refer to our security filings and earnings supplement for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.","In a few minutes, our CFO, David Edelson will walk you through the key drivers for the quarter and the year. But before he does, Jim Tisch, our CEO, will kick off the call. Jim, over to you.","Jim Tisch","Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Loews had a disappointing fourth quarter, results negatively affected by higher than expected catastrophe losses at CNA and severe declines in the stock market at the end of 2018, impacting both Loews\u2019 and CNA\u2019s investment portfolios. Specifically with regard to CNA, let\u2019s put these equity related losses in context. While the stock market declined 14% in the fourth quarter, CNA\u2019s limited partnership and common equity portfolios were down 5.7% or about a $138 million, counterbalancing CNA\u2019s fourth quarter investment performance, underlying operations for the full year were strong.","In 2018, net written premiums grew by 4% and rate increased by 2.6%. CNA\u2019s underlying combined ratio improved for the second straight year and while CNA\u2019s loss ratio ticked up slightly in 2018, it\u2019s essentially on par with its top quartile peers. Additionally, CNA has reduced its expense ratio by 2 points over the past two years, while still making necessary investments in technology, analytics and talents.","Earlier today, in light of the full year 2018 results and its strong balance sheet and the CNA Board\u2019s positive outlooks, CNA declared a $0.35 quarterly dividend as well as a $2 special dividend. These dividend payments will result in Loews receiving $570 million in dividends from CNA in March of this year. Over the last five years, including the upcoming March dividend payment, Loews will have received almost $4 billion in dividends from CNA.","Moving on to Loews Hotels, I\u2019m happy to report that the company had a stellar year. In 2018, Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA grew by 15% and has nearly doubled since 2014. This tremendous progress is due to operational improvements and the Company\u2019s ongoing commitment to grow in two focus areas. First, Loews Hotels is concentrating on highly profitable distinguished hotels that cater to group business. These hotels are better able to withstand disruptors such as the sharing economy. These hotels typically have between 300 and 800 rooms along with significant meeting space, properties such as our hotels in Chicago and Miami Beach, as well as the soon to be opened Loews Kansas City hotel.","The other area of focus for Loews Hotels continues to be developing hotel properties that have unique built-in demand generators. More than 20 years ago, Loews Hotels CEO, John Tisch set this strategy in motion with the Company\u2019s initial 50-50 partnership with NBCUniversal in developing hotels on their Orlando theme park campus, a partnership that has resulted in a highly profitable long-term joint venture for Loews Hotels and Universal.","Starting with the Loews Portofino Bay Hotel in 1999 with 750 rooms, the partnership now has six properties on the Orlando campus with 6,200 rooms. There are another 2,800 rooms under construction, the first 750 of which are set to open in June of this year. These hotels in Orlando dramatically outperformed their competitive set in average daily rate occupancy rate and therefore RevPAR.","We hope to continue our success in managing themed concepts and one-of-a-kind destinations with our Live! By Loews Hotels. The Live! By Loews Hotel in Arlington, Texas being developed in partnership with The Cordish Companies and the Texas Rangers is set to open this summer at the base of Globe Life Park and next to AT&T Stadium. In early 2020, the Live! By Loews in St. Louis will open. We are partnering with The Cordish Companies on this hotel as well along with the St. Louis Cardinals. The property will be located next to Busch Stadium.","Before turning the call over to David, I want to discuss share repurchases, which I believe have been and will continue to be a significant means of creating value for Loews shareholders. In 2018, we repurchased a little over 20 million shares of Loews common stock for just over $1 billion, which was equivalent of about 6% of our outstanding shares.","We don\u2019t have an automatic share repurchase program, because we\u2019re sensitive to the price at which we buy back our shares. We repurchased Loews stock only when it\u2019s trading below our view of its true, intrinsic value. We believe this capital allocation tools is one of the best ways to create value for all Loews shareholders over the intermediate to long-term.","And on that note, David over to you.","David Edelson","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Today we reported fourth quarter net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share, as compared to net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. For the full year, we reported net income of $636 million or $1.99 per share, down from $1.16 billion or $3.45 per share in 2017.","As a reminder, included in last year\u2019s fourth quarter and full year net income was a $200 million net benefit related to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We have included a table in our earnings supplement laying out the impact of this net benefit by reporting segment. In my ensuing remarks, I will speak to results before the Q4 2017 impact of the Tax Act. Note that the year-over-year comparisons were also affected by the ongoing impact of the lower U.S. corporate tax rate.","Let me start by discussing the key drivers of our fourth quarter loss and then turn my attention to our full year results. As Jim mentioned, the two main drags on our earnings in Q4 were investment results at both CNA and the parent company caused by difficult equity market conditions and catastrophe losses at CNA caused primarily by Hurricane Michael and the California wildfires.","At CNA, the Company\u2019s limited partnership and common stock investments lost ground in the fourth quarter, yielding a negative return versus positive results in Q4 2017. This swing accounted for $126 million of the decline in CNA\u2019s contribution to our net income. As Jim highlighted, negative returns in a quarter when the S&P 500 was down 14% are no surprise.","Additionally at CNA, the company had realized investment losses in the fourth quarter versus realized gains last year. This change accounted for another $73 million of the decline in CNA\u2019s net income contribution. The Loews parent company portfolio of limited partnership and common stock investments also lost ground in Q4, accounting for $82 million of the decline in after-tax investment income. A lower level of invested assets in 2018 also contributed to the year-over-year decline.","As for catastrophe losses, CNA booked $146 million of pre-tax losses in the fourth quarter, as compared to just $38 million in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. CNA is in the business of assuming risk, so it fully expects to absorb catastrophe losses in the quarter with such significant catastrophe activity. The higher level of catastrophe losses at CNA accounted for $81 million of the year-over-year decline in CNA\u2019s contribution to our net income.","To summarize, the factors cited above in total accounted for over 80% of the year-over-year decline in our quarterly net income, excluding the one-time impact of the Tax Act. A couple more observations on the quarter before turning to the full year. Average shares outstanding declined 7% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter, reflecting our share repurchase activity and the reduction in the corporate tax rate, actually exaggerated the size of the year-to-year quarterly variance in our after-tax results given the pre-tax losses at CNA, Diamond and the parent company.","Now let me review our full year results. As I mentioned earlier, our net income of $636 million in 2018 was lower than the $964 million we earned in 2017, which excludes the $200 million one-time impact of the Tax Act. CNA\u2019s core underwriting results were strong in 2018, as it posted a consistent underlying combined ratio of 95.4% and net written premium growth of 4%.","Catastrophe losses were actually down on an annual basis, but offsetting this, the company posted a lesser amount of favorable prior year development. All in all, at CNA, pre-tax underwriting income was up modestly. The main drivers therefore, of the year-to-year decline in CNA\u2019s contribution to our net income were net realized investment losses, lower P&C net investment income and increased charges related to the loss portfolio transfer.","Let me touch on [indiscernible] CNA swung from realized gains in 2017 to losses in 2018. This swing reduced our net income by $112 million relative to last year. P&C investment income for 2018 was hurt by a $42 million pre-tax loss generated by limited partnership and common stock investments, as compared to $207 million of pre-tax gains in the prior year. This change reduced our net income by $150 million versus last year.","Finally CNA\u2019s Corporate segment contributed to the year-to-year decline, largely due to prior year development on the loss portfolio transfer with National Indemnity. As a reminder, in 2010, CNA sees a substantially all of its legacy asbestos and environmental liabilities to National Indemnity, through a loss portfolio transfer.","Activity under the loss portfolio transfer is accounted for using retroactive reinsurance accounting, which is described in all its glory in our 10-K. CNA recorded adverse net prior year reserve development under the loss portfolio transfer in 2018, which reduced Loews\u2019 year-over-year net income by $34 million.","Turning to Diamond. Diamond Offshore reported a pre-tax loss of $226 million as compared to a loss of $22 million in 2017. Stripping out non-recurring items, such as asset impairments in both years and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt in 2017, the year-to-year pre-tax comparison is a pre-tax loss of $176 million in 2018, against pre-tax income of $118 million in 2017. Diamond continued to experience a fall-off in revenues in 2018, given the difficult market conditions and the effects of contract renegotiations.","Contract drilling revenues fell 27% at both revenue earning days and average daily revenue declined. Operating expenses excluding non-recurring items declined only 6%, resulting in a swing from pre-tax operating income in 2017 to an operating loss in 2018.","As we\u2019ve discussed, Diamond is positioning itself for an eventual upturn. In 2019, Diamond will be investing approximately $350 million in its fleet to ensure its race continue to be considered top tier by customers. Diamond ended the year with over $450 million in cash and equivalents. The company has over $1.2 billion of revolver capacity until 2020 and $950 million of capacity into 2023.","Boardwalk experienced a 32% decline in pre-tax income in 2018, which excludes the loss on the sale of a processing plant in 2017. Net revenues declined 5%, as transportation revenues from growth projects and higher system utilization were more than offset by unfavorable parking loan and storage revenues, as well as the net negative impact of transportation contract expirations, renewals and restructurings.","Moreover, expenses were up given higher depreciation expense from new growth projects, resulting in pre-tax margins declining from 27% to 20%. Despite the decline in pre-tax income, Boardwalk\u2019s contribution to our net income, excluding the loss on sale and one-time Tax Act impacts rose from $101 million in 2017 to $135 million in 2018.","The increased net income contribution relates to our purchase in July of 2018 of the outstanding publicly held common units of Boardwalk. For the second half of the year, we included 100% of Boardwalk\u2019s earnings in our net income, versus just 50% \u2013 51% during all of 2017 and the first half of 2018.","As Jim mentioned, Loews Hotels had a strong year, generating pre-tax income of $73 million, up from $65 million in 2017. Excluding all non-recurring items such as impairments, disposition gains and losses and pre-opening expenses, pre-tax income increased from $54 million in 2017 to $72 million in 2018. The extent of Loews Hotels non-recurring items primarily relates to ongoing portfolio management along with the development of new properties, all consistent with the company\u2019s strategic focus on group meetings hotels and immersive destinations.","Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is defined and disclosed in our quarterly earnings supplement, rose 15% in 2018 to $228 million. Numerous properties, including the six hotels at the Universal Orlando Resort, the Loews Miami Beach and the Loews Philadelphia to name just a few performed well during the year.","Parent company net investment income was down meaningfully in 2018. The small loss we posted for the year, stemmed from disappointing returns on our holdings of equity securities and LPs, again, largely attributable to the equity market drop in Q4. Also, our portfolio of cash and investments averaged $3.9 billion in 2018, down from an average of over $5 billion in 2017.","Share repurchase activity and the purchase of the Boardwalk units, caused the decrease. We continue to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $3.1 billion with 62% in cash and equivalents, 33% in LPs and marketable equity securities and the remaining 5% in fixed maturities.","During the fourth quarter, we received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries. $85 million from CNA and $25 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $878 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing $801 million of that amount. Today CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.35 quarterly dividend.","Combining the two, Loews will receive $570 million in dividends from CNA this quarter. We repurchased 2.9 million shares in the fourth quarter for a $135 million and 20.3 million shares during all of 2018 for just over $1 billion. Since year-end, we have repurchased an additional 0.9 million shares at an average price of about $46.50.","I will now hand the call back to Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, David. We\u2019ll now go to questions from shareholders.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Mary Skafidas","Our first question is, CNA\u2019s earnings this quarter are pretty ugly. Can you add to your prepared remarks and comment further on their results?","Jim Tisch","Sure, Mary. First of all, earnings were very ugly, but it was driven by two main factors, one was catastrophe losses and in that department, our catastrophe losses for the quarter were $146 million versus $38 million in the prior year. I should add that the $146 million of catastrophe losses that we had in the quarter was in no way disproportionate to the size of CNA.","On a combined ratio basis, that was 8.6 points versus 2.3 points in the prior year for the quarter. Aside from catastrophe losses, the other thing that hurt CNA\u2019s earnings significantly was the investment results, and specifically the results from our LP portfolio and common stocks, which was a $138 million loss in the quarter versus the fourth quarter of the prior year, which was a $50 million gain.","And in my opinion, those two temporary factors are overshadowing a lot of the good things that are going on at CNA. Net written premiums for the year last year were up 4%, gross written premiums were up 7% and the difference between the 7% and the 4% is the additional reinsurance that CNA is purchasing. The underlying combined ratio was 95.4% about the same as last year.","CNA paid a dividend \u2013 announced the dividend \u2013 announced the quarterly \u2013 regular quarterly dividend as well as the $2 special dividend, in my opinion, reflecting the Board\u2019s confidence in the results of CNA and the way that the company is operating and proceeding. CNA continues to achieve significant rate increases across a number of lines. So from my perspective, things at CNA, notwithstanding the relatively ugly quarter, are really going pretty well.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Jim for that additional clarification. Our next question is on Loews Hotels. Loews Hotels has a number of development projects under way. Can you expand on the Loews Hotels strategy?","Jim Tisch","Sure. What we\u2019ve seen is that there is a generational shift in spending, where the millennial generation is moving more toward experiences rather than things. We see this play out especially in Orlando, with our joint venture with Universal theme parks. We have six hotels there and we\u2019re building a seventh hotel now that has 2,800 rooms. On the Comcast earnings call, Brian Roberts reported something that we already knew that the occupancy ratio of our Orlando hotels is over 90%.","And as I mentioned in my remarks, as a result of the occupancy ratio and the higher than market average daily rate, we\u2019re able to achieve extraordinary RevPAR numbers in that market. So what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve taken the learnings that we have from Orlando and we\u2019ve applied it to the rest of our business. First, we are striving to be close to demand generators, whether it\u2019s a sports arena, a stadium or a convention center.","Secondly, we are working hard to leverage our unique position in the hotel business. We own our own hotels, we\u2019re not a manager of hotels. And therefore, we are willing to put up money to develop hotel properties and as a result, we find that partners are very willing to work with us. And those partners are financial partners as well as municipal partners.","And as a result, we\u2019re able \u2013 we find to procure for ourselves very attractive development opportunities, which we\u2019re now moving forward with in St. Louis, in Arlington and Kansas City. When investing holding company cash, we\u2019re very, very cognizant of the need to earn good rates of return, and we believe that the hotels that we\u2019re investing in are doing just that. We have a team that\u2019s continuing to look for additional opportunities, and I suspect that in the coming years, we\u2019ll see opportunities that is attractive to us as what we\u2019re doing in these three new markets that we\u2019re developing right now.","Mary Skafidas","Great. Thank you, Jim. Next question is on Diamond Offshore. How do you feel about the offshore drilling market is recovering on the horizon? Why hasn\u2019t Diamond taken part in industry consolidation?","Jim Tisch","So, one of the nice things about having been in the business for over 40 years is that you\u2019ve seen a lot of things. And I like to think that with respect to offshore drilling, I\u2019ve seen this movie before in the supertanker business. In the supertanker business, there was a glut of supertankers in the early \u201980s. Through scrapping, deterioration of the rigs and a slight increase in demand, we saw a whipsaw recovery in the mid to late 1980s. And I see for offshore drilling a similar thing that\u2019s happening now.","First of all, all the offshore drilling companies are managing to one thing and one thing only at this point in time. And that is to cash. Cash is the thing that they\u2019re not earning that they desperately need in order to stay in business. So for the rigs that are not operating, it\u2019s a big lift for them to spend cash on maintaining those rigs with no business opportunities in sight. And what happens, I\u2019ve seen very clearly from the tanker industry and also from offshore drilling is that when ships, rigs, drillships are left on the water and they are not operating, then they can deteriorate very rapidly.","Combined with that right now, oil prices are relatively low at about $52 a barrel for WTI, and about $61 a barrel for Brent oil. My belief is that with an increase in oil prices, which I see happening, I think we could see over the coming years, a pretty significant increase in demand and that demand increase will first go to rigs that are already operating and then, later on to rigs that are stacked.","Our estimation is that the cost to recommission a rig, that\u2019s been stacked for a number of years can easily be in excess of $100 million per rig and that cash today just doesn\u2019t exist in the industry to recommission more than a few rigs. So I think that the recommissioning of rigs will be slow, especially in view of the fact that our customers tend to like to use rigs that have already been working, rather than rigs that are being recommissioned. So I think it\u2019s going to be a long time for rigs to come back to meet the demand that I foresee going forward.","In terms of Diamond. Diamond has a relatively long runway within the industry. Diamond had at the end of the quarter about $450 million in cash and it has an additional borrowing capacity of about $1 billion. So it\u2019s got close to $1.5 billion of liquidity that really is the runway for Diamond, which is substantially in excess of a lot of our other competitors. In terms of consolidation, we\u2019ve looked for opportunities, but what I would say is the \u2013 we have not been able to find any transactions that would be accretive to value for all Diamond shareholders.","So we continue to look for opportunities. I would say that the spread between bid and ask for drilling assets is very wide, and the only transactions that really seem to get done these days are transactions where somebody gives their shares in return for buying other shares. But we continue to scour the earth to have discussions, but to date, there\u2019s not much to report.","Mary Skafidas","Okay. Thank you, Jim. Laurie, we\u2019d like to turn the call over to you to open up the call for additional questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Yes. Good morning, everybody.","Jim Tisch","Good morning.","David Edelson","Hi.","Josh Shanker","Good morning. Jim, I think I have asked you this question before, but it takes, I guess, a new sort of meaning. CNA says they\u2019re going to be getting out of a bunch of hedge funds that they put money into, and I kind of feel you may disagree that a good part of CNA\u2019s money is your money. What is the investment philosophy around risk assets that make sense for Loews? And in terms of like being in those hedge funds, not in those hedge funds, I know you have also a pool \u2013 a small pool of money at Loews you run with risk on it. What is the overriding way that you think about trying to allocate portfolios to risk assets?","Jim Tisch","Sure. So first, let me address the issue of results. At Loews, in the first five weeks, five or six weeks of this year, we have earned back all that we lost in the fourth quarter of last year. So we reported a loss of about $70 million in our portfolio in the fourth quarter of last year, and the portfolio was up by more than that at Loews. At CNA, they\u2019ve recovered over 60% of their losses.","But let me take a minute and talk about the different types of things that people can be invested in. You can invest in stocks, you can invest in hedge funds, you can invest in private equity. And one of the things that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s struck me in this past \u2013 in the past few months is that in the fourth quarter, the S&P 500 was down 14%, our hedge funds were down about 6%, and generally, across the board private equity firms have reported no loss at all.","And I actually find that quite incredulous. It\u2019s what I would call a self-graded exam. There was a temporary drop in the market and the private equity firms didn\u2019t report a loss. It\u2019s inconceivable to me that stocks could be down 14% and that there is no loss in private equity. So CNA is in some ways bearing the pain of being mark-to-market, whereas in private equity, there is more of what I would call a mark to moving average, but it\u2019s just something that we have to deal with.","In terms of the strategy, CNA\u2019s had a very good run with hedge funds as has Loews. We\u2019re starting to de-emphasize them because we think that, number one, there\u2019s an awful lot of capital that\u2019s invested in them. We think the returns has been competed down. Additionally, in today\u2019s \u2013 over the past 10 years, you were able to earn zero on your cash balances. Today you can easily earn 2.5% to 3%.","So simply investing in cash is not such a terrible alternative to hedge funds. We\u2019re looking at risk assets that go beyond hedge funds and private equity. We\u2019re looking at certain debt instruments. We\u2019re looking at certain, what I would call, nontraditional private equity investments. We\u2019re just trying to figure out over the coming year what will be the best vehicles for risk assets for both CNA and for Loews.","David Edelson","And, Josh, let me just add that if you look at the quarter, obviously, it looks pretty ugly on the year. This portfolio was down just under 2%. The prior year it made 9% returns. And the year before that, it made 6% returns. So clearly, just focusing in solely on the fourth quarter it\u2019s an aberration.","Josh Shanker","Okay. Thank you. And if I can get one more in. Changing gears, can we talk about acquisition pipeline and how it looks for Consolidated Container?","Jim Tisch","There\u2019s a \u2013 they made, I think three acquisition last year, and each one relatively small. And there are a number of other opportunities that\u2019s in their pipeline and they\u2019re continuing to kick tires. What we found is that our thesis is proving out that we\u2019re able to acquire smaller manufacturers of containers at say, 8 or 9 times EBITDA, and as a result, own it, because of our economies of scale at 6 and 7 times EBITDA. So we\u2019re very pleased with the acquisition market, and we\u2019re also pleased with our overall investment in CCC.","Josh Shanker","Would all acquisitions that CCC does be self-funded?","Jim Tisch","To date, they have been, and based on the set of opportunities that we\u2019re looking at, we continue to believe that they will be self-funding.","Josh Shanker","Okay. Thank you very much.","David Edelson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude the Q&A portion of the conference. I\u2019ll now return the call to Mary Skafidas for any closing comments.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Laurie. As always, thank you, everyone for your continued interest. A replay of this call will be available on our website, loews.com in approximately two hours. That concludes Loews call for today.","Operator","Thank you for participating in the Loews Corporation Q4 2018 earnings conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Loews Corporation Q3 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mary Skafidas. Please go ahead.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Loews Corporation third quarter earnings conference call. A copy of our earnings release, earnings supplement and company overview may be found on our website, loews.com. On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Edelson. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those made or implied in any forward-looking statements due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is only a brief summary of the company's statutory forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included in the company's filings with the SEC.","During the call today, we might also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our security filings and earnings supplement for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.","In a few moments, our Chief Financial Officer, David Edelson, will walk you through the key drivers for the quarter. Before he does, Jim Tisch, our CEO, will kick off the call. Jim, over to you.","James Tisch","Thank you, Mary. Today, I'd like to talk briefly about 2 things, CNA and share repurchases. CNA delivered another good quarter, thanks to strong operational results and more normalized catastrophe losses. While good quarterly results are always welcome, at Loews, we understand that there are a number of factors that can positively or negatively impact earnings. And for that reason, we focus on making decisions and running businesses for the long term, and we continue to see positive outcomes from some of the decisions made over the past decade at CNA. CNA has worked hard to strengthen its underwriting talent, improve its technology infrastructure and expand its distribution network, all while maintaining its fortress balance sheet. CNA has also actively managed the risks from its runoff, long-term care segment.","On their earnings call earlier this morning, the company's CEO, Dino Robusto; and CFO, James Anderson, walked shareholders through additional details about their long-term care book of business. CNA's proactive management of this business, together with its reserve unlocking at year-end 2015, has led to several years of stable results. And at Loews, we feel great about how they've handled it. Let me hit some of the highlights that Dino and James talked about. First, the long-term care business is a closed book of business that's in the runoff mode. CNA has not written a new individual long-term care policy since 2003. And since 2015, the number of individual policyholders has decreased by 15%. Also, around 2003, CNA stopped accepting new group long-term care policies. The active lives in these group policies have declined 29% since the end of 2015. Additionally, CNA's long-term care book of business is mature. The company has processed more than 100,000 claims, which have yielded solid data that CNA is using to model reserves for the segment going forward.","We are confident that CNA's long-term care reserves are built on prudent assumptions. For example, CNA's reserves assume only rate increases that CNA has already filed but have not yet been approved, or rate increases that the company plans to file in the near future as part of a current rate increase program. Beyond that, no other rate increases are assumed. At Loews, we're very interested in CNA's long-term care book of business and their active management of it. We engage with CNA regularly about the company's strategic direction for the long-term care segment as well as its reserves. And we feel confident that CNA is adequately reserved and is managing the business appropriately.","And if you need more proof of how we feel about CNA, look no further than our share repurchases. Since the beginning of 2014, we have purchased about 74 million shares of Loews stock at a total cost of $3.2 billion, fully cognizant of CNA's long-term care exposure. As our largest subsidiary, CNA makes up a significant portion of the value of each Loews common share, so our buybacks underscore the confidence we feel in our insurance subsidiary's long-term value-creation power. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 5.5% of our outstanding common stock or more than 18 million shares at a total cost of about $920 million. As long-term listeners to this call know, at Lowes, we don't have an automatic share repurchase program, buying shares no matter what. We are very sensitive to the price we pay for anything, especially our shares. When we can repurchase Loews' shares at below our view of their intrinsic value, we feel that's a great use of our cash. Share buybacks remain one of the most effective ways to invest in our business while also rewarding long-term holders of the stock. Rather than complain about the prices of Loews and CNA, we recognize the gift that the markets are giving us, and we buy our shares.","Over to you, David.","David Edelson","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $278 million or $0.88 per share, up from $157 million or $0.46 per share in last year's third quarter. Our EPS comparison benefited from share repurchase activity over the past 12 months. Page 13 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key quarterly drivers.","A quick summary of the quarter. CNA accounted for the bulk of our year-over-year net income improvement as lower catastrophe losses and continued strong underlying -- underwriting income drove the results. Boardwalk and Loews Hotels also posted favorable year-over-year contributions. Offsetting these increases were lower contributions from Diamond Offshore and the parent company investment portfolio. As in Q1 and Q2, the lower corporate tax rate benefited our year-over-year after-tax results. Now for more detail. CNA's after-tax earnings contribution was $300 million, up $170 million from Q3 2017. P&C underwriting income drove the increase. CNA's third quarter combined ratio improved almost 10 points from 103.7 in 2017 to 94.2 in 2018, translating into a $161 million increase in pretax P&C underwriting income at CNA. Lower catastrophe losses at CNA drove the year-over-year underwriting improvement. In 2017, CNA had pretax catastrophe losses of $269 million or 16.5 points versus only $46 million or 2.6 points in this year's third quarter. Catastrophe losses reduced Loews' third quarter net income by $32 million this year versus $170 million last year.","CNA booked favorable prior year development in both Q3 2018 and Q3 2017, although the amount of favorable development was less this year than last, partially offsetting the earnings impact of this substantially lower catastrophe losses. CNA's underlying combined ratio of 94.8, which excludes cats and prior year development, was essentially in line with last year's third quarter. Other factors favorably impacting CNA's year-over-year comparison were higher after-tax net investment income, the absence this year of last year's loss on the early redemption of debt and higher income in the Life & Group segment, which includes long-term care.","CNA has disclosed more information about its long-term care business in its quarterly earnings presentation, which can be found on its IR website. Please note that CNA completed its long-term care reserve review in Q3 and intends to shift its reserve review to the third quarter going forward. The company's GAAP LTC reserves, which totaled just under $12 billion, are split approximately 77-23 between reserves for future policy benefits, also known as active life reserves, and claims reserves. This year's review resulted in a modest favorable release from its claims reserve and no unlocking of its active life reserves.","Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a net loss of $27 million in Q3 2018 as compared to net income of $6 million last year, reflecting their continued decline in drilling activity and average day rate for Diamond fleet. Contract drilling revenues declined 21% versus only a 5% decline in contract drilling costs. Revenue earning days and average daily revenue were both down as the company experienced contract expirations as well as rigs rolling to lower day rates. Unusual items affected Diamond's earnings in both years' third quarters. Diamond's 2018 contribution was reduced by $8 million because of a legal settlement. Last year, a loss on the early retirement of debt reduced our earnings by $11 million. Diamond continues to focus on ensuring it has ample liquidity during this extended market trough. At the beginning of our October, Diamond executed a new 5-year $950 million revolving credit facility. The new revolver is in addition to Diamond's existing revolver, which was reduced to $325 million, $100 million, of which matures in 2019 and the remainder in the fourth quarter of 2020. Currently, both of the facilities remain undrawn.","Boardwalk contributed $28 million to our net income, up from $17 million last year. The year-over-year comparison was affected by Loews' 100% ownership of Boardwalk in Q3 2018 versus 51% last year. Had Loews owned 100% of Boardwalk in last year's third quarter, net income contribution would have declined year-over-year even with the reduction in the corporate tax rate. The decline in profitability stemmed from margin compression, which caused Boardwalk's pretax income to drop from $69 million to $38 million in Q3 2018. The company experienced a $17 million decrease in net operating revenues, a $12 million increase in operating expenses and a slight increase in interest expense. The revenue decline was driven by contract expirations, contract renewals at lower rates, contract restructurings and lower parking & lending and storage results. Partially offsetting these declines were revenues generated by the growth projects and higher system utilization. Boardwalk's operating expenses increased because of the depreciation property taxes and employee-related costs.","Loews Hotels had a terrific third quarter. Its net income contribution was $11 million, up from $4 million in Q3 2017. Its adjusted EBITDA, which is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings supplement, rose nearly 17% from last year's third quarter to $49 million. Loews Most Miami Beach and Coronado were the main drivers of the improved performance. Continued earnings growth generated by the Universal Orlando joint venture was masked by costs associated with the opening of the 600-room Aventura Hotel during the third quarter.","Turning to the parent company. Pretax investment income was $5 million, down $43 million from the prior year's third quarter driven by lower returns on equities and alternatives. The corporate tax rate differential between the 2 years benefited the year-over-year after-tax comparison.","Corporate and other was consistent with the prior year on a pretax basis. The higher after-tax loss was solely attributable to the lower tax rate in Q3 2018. During Q3 2018, we received $111 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $85 million from CNA and $26 million from Boardwalk. We repurchased 1.8 million shares during the third quarter at an aggregate cost of $88 million. We purchased an additional 1 million shares since quarter end for approximately $47 million. As Jim mentioned, we have repurchased 18.4 million shares during 2018 for about $923 million, representing 5.5% of our shares outstanding at year-end 2017.","Loews ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and investments. As I stated last quarter, we are rebalancing our invested assets in light of the cash used to acquire the Boardwalk units. At quarter end, cash and equivalents accounted for over 60% of the parent company portfolio.","Let me now turn it back to Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, David. Samantha, we'd like to open the call for questions. Can you provide participants with instructions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker","I wanted to bring back a question, maybe I've asked you in private or maybe public in the past. Thoughts on another 10% of CNA being publicly traded and how liquidity impacts fair valuation for that company.","James Tisch","When you say another 10%, do you mean...","Joshua Shanker","Or thereabout, not below 80% held by you guys.","James Tisch","You mean at selling shares down to 80%?","Joshua Shanker","Yes.","James Tisch","We're very happy with our investment in CNA. We're buying in the shares of Loews. For every share of Loews, there's more than 0.77 shares of CNA. So for the life of me, I can't imagine why it is we should sell shares of CNA. We think Loews is cheap. We think CNA is cheap.","Joshua Shanker","Okay. Well, do you think it might be able to more fully realize its valuation if there was more liquidity?","James Tisch","The last sentence of my comments said that if the market isn't going to price our shares and CNA's shares accordingly, we'll just take the gift and buy in the shares. Listen, I would love for CNA to be at a price that reflects its true value. But as you know, I don't complain about it. We put our money where our mouth is instead.","Joshua Shanker","And in terms of positioning the investment portfolio, do you have some comments about any changes you might be making as we go into 2019?","James Tisch","So we're pleased with the increase in treasury rates. That should allow CNA to get a higher rate of returning on money that it has to reinvest that is otherwise might have earlier this year or over the past few years. In terms of equities, we're not making a big change to our portfolio now. As David has said, we have reduced our hedge fund portfolio somewhat, reflective the fact -- of the fact that we have $3 billion to $3.5 billion of investment assets rather than $5 billion. And likewise, there's been a slight reduction of hedge funds at CNA. But otherwise, there has been no major moves in the portfolios. One other thing that -- I'm sorry, one other thing that's happened is that as a result of the tax bill, we've -- at CNA, they've begun to reduce their municipal bond portfolio, and that's because with a 35% tax rate, immunities have a lot more value to CNA than when the corporate tax rate is 21%.","Joshua Shanker","That was my follow-up question. I think about 3 quarters, though, you said there were immunities available on the market at equivalent yields to other stuff that you might buy, and so even though they weren't as tax efficient as they used to be, that they were still valuable. Has the market become more rational and those opportunities have gone away?","James Tisch","Yes. And when you think about it, CNA has a 21% tax rate. Individuals in New York State, they have close to a 50% tax rate. So immunities are much more valuable to individuals than they are to corporations.","Operator","That concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call back over to Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Great. Thanks, Samantha, and thanks to all of you for your continued interest.

A copy of our earnings release and snapshot may be found on our website, loews.com.","On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, Peter Keegan. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call may include statements that are forward looking in nature.

Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made, and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.

Please refer to our security filings for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.","I will now turn the call over to Loews' Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch. Jim?","James S. Tisch","Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today.","Loews had net income of $269 million, or $0.69 per share, for the second quarter of 2013 as compared to $56 million, or $0.14 per share, for the same quarter last year. Last year's second quarter was impacted by an after-tax ceiling test impairment charge at HighMount of $142 million, or $0.36 per share.","Before we take a closer look at the results and the progress of each of our subsidiaries, I want to address the rise in interest rates since May 3 and the impact these rates -- rate increases have had and will have on our investment strategy and our fixed income portfolio.","Let's take a trip down memory lane. In February of 2011, I stated on our earnings call that interest rates in the U.S. would inevitably rise. I remarked that rising interest rates would result in a decline in the market value of CNA's investment portfolio, given that CNA's portfolio is comprised predominantly of fixed income securities. Such a decline would in turn negatively impact GAAP book value.","Fast forward to today, and that's exactly what's happening. CNA's unrealized gain decreased by 41%, or $1.8 billion, during the second quarter, from $4.3 billion at March 31 to $2.5 billion at June 30. There is, however, a silver lining to higher interest rates, which is that CNA will have the opportunity to invest its significant operating and investment cash flows into higher-yielding securities.","As a reminder, CNA manages its investments within 2 distinct portfolios: the property\/casualty portfolio, which supports the core P&C liabilities; and the Life & Group portfolio, which supports the longer duration liabilities in CNA's Life & Group segment. The ability to invest at higher yields ultimately benefits both portfolios.","But that's enough from the \"I told you so\" department. Now let's move smartly along to the \"I'd rather be lucky than smart\" department. As many of you on the call know, on May 2, we issued a $1 billion of senior debt securities consisting of $500 million of 10-year notes with a 2 5\/8% coupon and $500 million of 30-year bonds with a coupon of 4 1\/8%. Given our already strong cash position, we had no immediate need for additional funds, so this transaction was purely opportunistic, allowing us to take advantage of favorable rates. Little did we know how favorable they would be. As it turns out, we issued our securities when interest rates were at their lowest. Like I said, I'd rather be lucky than smart. Over the years, we have found that it's easier to raise money when you can, rather than when you have to.","Now let's take a look at our subsidiaries' results, starting with CNA. CNA received some great news in June when S&P upgraded the company's financial strength rating from A- to A, in recognition of CNA's strong capital position and earnings. It's a real credit to the progress being made by the management team at CNA.","CNA had a good quarter and continued to improve its underwriting performance. Excluding catastrophes and prior year development, CNA saw continued improvement in the combined ratio and loss ratio in its core P&C operations. Its underlying P&C combined ratio improved 3.6 points versus the second quarter of 2012, and the underlying loss ratio had a year-over-year decrease of about 2.9 points.","Premium rates continued to be strong, increasing approximately 8% during the quarter in CNA's P&C operations. For CNA Commercial, rates increased 9% for the quarter. And for CNA Specialty, they increased 7%.","Now let's turn to Diamond Offshore. Demand for offshore ultra-deepwater drilling rigs remained strong, as reflected by attractive day rates. Diamond had a solid second quarter and is moving forward with the same core strategies which we believe create value for all shareholders.","Diamond's fleet renewal program is ongoing. During the second quarter, Diamond announced its latest new build, a harsh-environment semisubmersible rig that will work for BP in Australia on a 3-year contract after it's delivered to Diamond in early 2016. The initial operating day rate under the drilling contract is $585,000, and the rig will cost approximately $755 million.","The cost, which is higher than recent drillship orders, reflects its harsh-environment capabilities. This new harsh-environment semi is in addition to Diamond's 4 drillships and 2 rebuilt semis that are currently under construction. The first rebuilt semi, the Ocean Onyx, will be delivered in early fall and is scheduled to go on day rate before the end of this year. The first of the drillships, the Ocean BlackHawk, will be delivered before the end of this year and will go on day rate early next year.","Diamond expects the Ocean Black Hornet, the second drillship, to begin working in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during the first half of 2014. Diamond expects to take delivery of the 2 additional drillships and the other rebuilt deepwater semi during 2014, and it's currently working to secure contract -- to securing contracts.","Moving on to Boardwalk, they had another stable quarter. Net income increased slightly over the same period last year. Louisiana Midstream, which was acquired in October of 2012, positively contributed to the quarter and helped offset a reduction in net income related to contract renewals. Louisiana Midstream enabled Boardwalk to enter the natural gas liquids storage and distribution business and further, the company's diversification strategy aimed at making Boardwalk less reliant on distributing and storing natural gas.","Continuing to focus on moving its diversification strategy forward, in May of this year, Boardwalk entered into a joint venture agreement with the Williams companies to continue the development process for the proposed Bluegrass Pipeline, along with related storage, fractionation and export terminal assets. The Bluegrass Pipeline would transport natural gas liquids from the Marcellus and Utica shales to growing petrochemical markets in the U.S. Gulf Coast. As Boardwalk CEO, Stan Horton, discussed earlier on their call, Williams and Boardwalk are meeting with potential customers about the project. We're hopeful that this significant project will move forward, but we are still in the early stages of the process.","Taking a look at HighMount, the company's operating results continued to be negatively affected by ongoing low prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids. HighMount has focused its drilling program on locations that could result in higher oil production, such as its acreage in the eastern portion of the Mississippian Lime in Oklahoma and the Wolfcamp Shale in the Permian Basin in Texas. Both of these programs are early in the development stage, and HighMount continues to improve its understanding of both plays.","And finally, some comments on Loews' hotels and resorts. Although there is substantial progress being made towards Loews Hotels' twin goals of broadening its customer base while improving profitability, you will not see that progress reflected in quarterly earnings during 2013, which is a transition year for Loews Hotels.","In the past year, Loews Hotels has undergone significant changes, adding properties in Boston, Washington and Los Angeles, developing properties in Orlando and Chicago and starting extensive renovations at a number of our hotels, most notably, the Loews Regency Hotel in New York, which has been closed since January. We believe the actions taken by Loews Hotels in 2013 will position the chain for enhanced profitability and growth in the years to come.","At the holding company, Loews ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $4.6 billion. We repurchased 1.9 million shares of Loews common stock for $85 million during the quarter and continued to repurchase shares after the quarter ended. Year-to-date, through July 26, we repurchased a total of 4.9 million shares of Loews common stock for a total of $216 million.","Now I'll turn the call over to Pete.","Peter W. Keegan","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone.","Loews Corporation today reported net income for the 2013 second quarter of $269 million compared to $56 million in the 2012 second quarter. Net income for the second quarter of 2012 includes an after-tax noncash impairment charge of $142 million at HighMount related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties. Excluding this impairment charge, net income for the second quarter of 2012 was $198 million.","Net income for the 6 months ended June 30, 2013, was $511 million, or $1.31 per share, as compared to $423 million, or $1.06 per share, in the prior year period. Net income for the 6 months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, includes after-tax noncash ceiling test impairment charges of $92 million and $170 million at HighMount. Excluding these noncash impairment charges, net income for the 6 months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, was $603 million and $593 million, respectively.","CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the second quarter was $175 million as compared to $151 million last year. CNA's earnings increased primarily from higher net investment income due to increased limited partnership results, improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results and a legal settlement benefit of $27 million after-tax and noncontrolling interest. These increases were partially offset by lower favorable net prior year development and reduced results from the Life & Group Non-Core segment.","Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the second quarter of 2013 was $87 million compared to $94 million in the prior year quarter. Results for the second quarter decreased primarily as a result of a prior year gain of $23 million after-tax and noncontrolling interest from the sale of 5 jack-up rigs partially offset by higher day rates and utilization, as well as lower contract drilling expense in 2013.","Boardwalk pipeline's contribution to net income for the second quarter was $22 million as compared to $25 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in Boardwalk's contribution to Loews' net income is because we owned a slightly smaller stake in the company than we did this time last year, 54% ownership in this quarter as compared to about 61% for the same quarter last year.","HighMount recorded net income of $5 million for the second quarter of 2013 compared to net income of $3 million in the second quarter of 2012, excluding a noncash cost center ceiling test impairment charge of $142 million after taxes for the second quarter of 2012.","HighMount's second quarter production volumes and realized prices, which included the benefit of hedges, are as follows: natural gas production was $8.2 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $4.31 per thousand cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 501.2 thousand barrels at an average realized price of $34.69 per barrel; oil production was 150.8 thousand barrels at an average price of $95.41 per barrel.","HighMount had hedges in place as of June 30, 2013, that covered approximately 67% and 36.7% of its total estimated 2013 and 2014 natural gas equivalent production at a weighted average price of $6.49 and $5.68 per Mcfe.","Loews Hotels contributed net income of $1 million compared to $6 million for the second quarter of 2012. Results were primarily due to the Loews Regency Hotel in New York, which will be closed for the majority of this year for extensive renovations, partially offset by newly acquired hotels, the Loews Madison Hotel in D.C. and the Loews Boston Back Bay Hotel.","Holding company cash and investments as of June 30, 2013, totaled $5.6 billion as compared to $3.7 billion at March 31, 2013. We received $182 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the second quarter of 2013 and $364 million in dividends year-to-date.","From CNA, Loews received $49 million in dividends in the second quarter of 2013 and $97 million in dividends year-to-date. From Diamond, Loews received $61 million in dividends in the second quarter of 2013 and $123 million in dividends year-to-date. From Boardwalk, Loews received $72 million in dividends from the second quarter of 2013 and $144 million in dividends year-to-date.","We paid $25 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the second quarter of 2013 and bought back 1.9 million shares of Loews common stock for $85 million. We also issued $1 billion in debt in May of this year.","As Jim mentioned, we continued to repurchase shares after the quarter ended. From July 1 to July 26, we repurchased a total of 868,000 shares of Loews common stock for $39.5 million.","I made a slight misstatement. I said we had $5.6 billion in cash. We have $4.6 billion in cash. And now, I've completed my remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Great. Thank you, Pete. Laurie, at this time, we would like to open up the call for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jim, were there any material changes in Loews' investment portfolio and its composition during the quarter?","James S. Tisch","No, not significant. You're talking about the holding company level, I assume?","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes.","James S. Tisch","Yes. Nothing significant. No.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So the bond proceeds, more or less, were allocated as pro rata with the existing mix and make up?","James S. Tisch","No. They are generally being held in cash instruments. So roughly, I would say the amount of hedge funds and equities that we own did not increase.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, Jim, with respect to HighMount and the effort with respect to oil production and the process you're going through and the test drilling and so forth that's being done, what, over the next year or 2, are going to be the key milestones that will indicate to you the prospects of success?","James S. Tisch","So in both the Mississippian Lime and also in the Permian Basin, in the Wolfcamp Shale, we are looking to see if we can produce oil from those 2 regions at economic rates. We know there is oil down there because we have drilled wells and we have and we still are producing it, but the question is whether we can figure out how to extract the oil and earn at least a reasonable rate of return on our investment. It will take us another several quarters to be able to determine whether or not we can do that. But we do know that the oil is down there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel of Janney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could, number one, give me what your debt balances were 6\/30?","Peter W. Keegan","We had $1.7 billion in debt at the holding company level, Bob.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you raised $1 billion and you're earning -- as great as the rates are that you borrowed, congratulations on timing it brilliantly...","James S. Tisch","Like I said, I'd rather be lucky than smart.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Right. But you're in a negative carry on it, so I was wondering -- should we think, over the next 3 to 5 years, the $1 billion is just going to be used on your trading portfolio, or this gets your sort set of acquisition team to a different level that you can do deals that you might not have done before? I mean, what do you anticipate the primary use is going to be over the sort of intermediate term?","James S. Tisch","Bob, I don't know. But the thing I do know is that over the past 15 years or so at least, we've had cash balances of $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion, $5 billion or $6 billion. We never worried about spending it. But lo and behold, the incoming cash that we had coming into Loews was spent either buying businesses or buying our shares or supplying capital at attractive returns to the businesses that we own. So somehow or other, we're able to find investments to make. And the thing that's driving us, though, is, like I said in my prepared remarks, we find it's much better to raise capital when the rates are attractive rather than to raise it when you need it. When you need it, the debt or the equity capital can be very, very expensive.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Totally understood. But you didn't mention buying stocks. You're buying bonds with the money as sort of a potential avenue to employ over the next 3 to 5 years. I mean, I know -- public comments about bonds, I would think rates would have to go up a decent bit to think about putting money at the corporate level there.","James S. Tisch","Here's what I'd say. If you want to buy the stock of a company that's got a significant equity portfolio, go to Berkshire Hathaway. We do not think that we are going to generate significant long-term returns for our shareholders by having a large equity portfolio. We're looking to either buy in our shares, buy another business or invest in our own businesses. That's the main way that we're going to build value for our shareholders. We have...","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","You do have a trading portfolio for a reason, though. Right?","James S. Tisch","Say again?","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","You do have a trading portfolio for a reason.","James S. Tisch","Yes, yes. We have an equity portfolio of about $500 million, $600 million. We have that because we do want -- we do have expertise in investing in equities, and we do think we can do a good job at it, combined with the fact that by having the equity portfolio, it keeps us closely in touch with the markets and what's going on. But in terms of that being a line of business or an avenue to significant shareholder value growth, I just don't think that's going to be the place.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Millman from Millman Research.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","I guess very recently, the -- there's been some federal investigation of financial companies involved in commodity movement. I was wondering if you're seeing anything regarding the gas pipelines and this connection?","James S. Tisch","No. To my knowledge, we've seen nothing like that at all. My understanding is that, with respect to the commodities that was written about in the New York Times, it was both commodities, typically metals, being delivered back and forth from one warehouse to another for Lord knows what reason. We haul natural gas under contract from one location to another, usually distant location, based on the orders from our customers. So my strong supposition is that, that is dramatically different than what you're seeing in the metals markets.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andy Baker of Barclays.","Andrew Baker","Two questions, I guess. First, lapping with [ph] last call, where you were talking about the impact of the exposure to gold in your portfolio, just wondering if you have maintained that same level of exposure to gold, both through the ETFs and the minors.","James S. Tisch","Yes, we have, and that's why the return in our investment portfolio was as low as it was this quarter. It was basically breakeven. That's because of the losses that we experienced on those gold-related investments, offset the gains we made from the rest of the portfolio.","Andrew Baker","Great. And could you just sort of explain a little bit more -- I don't think we've talked about this in the past, but how -- what the ROI is on the hotel renovation investment dollar? I mean, you put -- you lose the revenues, you spend the money. And then how does this come back to you? Is this -- I mean, higher room rates? Is it higher occupancy? Is it -- I assume it's not a cost cut.","James S. Tisch","So for some hotels where there's maintenance CapEx, you have to do that just to keep the property up to snuff. For other hotels -- and there isn't a significant additional ROI from that. On the other hand, for a hotel like the Regency, we're expecting a very significant return on our investment, as this is really the first major, major upgrade that we've had in the hotel in 50 years. And we expect a significant increase in the hotels' EBITDA. So we believe that the investment will have a significant double-digit rate of return. The other place where we invest for the hotel company, other than maintenance CapEx and rehabilitation CapEx, is in new hotels. And there, we're doing that in the form of hotels that we're developing, either in Orlando or Chicago, or hotels that we're purchasing. And there, again, we don't put a number on the ROI that we expect out of the investment, but we think those ROIs will be very attractive for us.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I'll now turn the call over to Mary Skafidas for any closing remarks.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Laurie, and thank you all for your continued interest. A replay will be available on our website, loews.com, in approximately 2 hours, and that concludes today's call.","Operator","Thank you for participating in Loews' Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.

Jim?","Jim Tisch","Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. I hope that you all had a chance to look at our press release, which was distributed earlier this morning.","Loews reported income from continuing operations for the first quarter of $109 million compared to $265 million in the first quarter of 2014. The quarter's results were significantly impacted by an impairment charge at Diamond Offshore of $158 million after-tax related to the carrying value of eight of its older drilling rigs. David Edelson, our CFO will provide more details on the charge and key earnings drivers later in the call.","I want to start today by looking at Loews $5.5 billion of cash and investments. Obviously, this is a lot of cash but that's nothing out of the ordinary for Loews. Over the years, maintaining a sizeable liquidity position has given us the freedom to deploy our capital opportunistically in order to create value for our shareholders over the long term.","We've done this by using our cash to invest in our subsidiaries to add new businesses, and to repurchase our shares. Let's briefly examine each of these levers.","Two subsidiaries we've provided funding for over the year - over the last few years have been Boardwalk and Loews Hotels. At Boardwalk when attractive capital markets funding has not been available or inflexible forms of financing are required, Loews has stepped in and provided bridge financing.","We work closely with Boardwalk's management team to hone the financing plans and our cash position enables us to utilize parent company capital and projects with attractive risk adjusted returns for both Loews and Boardwalk.","At Loews' hotels over the past six months, the parent company has invested approximately $300 million to finance hotel acquisitions. Some of these investment have been in the form of equity bridge financing which we anticipate will be returned as Loews' hotels brings in outside equity partners. We like this model and we intend to use it going forward to acquire additional hotels.","In addition to enabling us to invest in our subsidiaries, a high level of liquidity allows us to move quickly and decisively when considering an acquisition at the holding company level. We are actively seeking to diversify our portfolio of businesses but we don't want to rush into a deal simply because we have the funds available.","Current valuations for companies and assets don't lend themselves to the kind of equity returns we want. We are looking for the right deal at the right price, either a company with good cash-on-cash returns and strong secular growth trends or distressed undervalued assets at an advantageous entry point in the cycle.","And finally, let's not forget about share repurchases which remain an important wave of Loews creates values for shareholders.","On our call last November, I discussed in detail the various metrics we use when considering share repurchases decisions including the sum of the parts calculation. Over the last year, Loews spent almost $700 million of its cash buying back almost $16 million shares.","As we have said before, money doesn't burn a hole in our pockets. While we acknowledge that cash can be a drag on Loews short term returns, we feel that having the flexibility to be opportunistic and not rely on financing markets has served our shareholders very well over the long term.","Now let's look at some highlights from our subsidiaries. Let's start with Diamond Offshore. Loews has been in the offshore drilling business for more than 25 years. In that time, we have learned one thing with absolute certainty, offshore drilling is a cyclical business, and therefore Diamond is managed accordingly.","Nine years ago when others were paying top dollars for new drilling rigs, Diamond began retuning capital to shareholders by paying special dividends. Since January of '06, Diamond has paid over $41 per share in regular and special dividends returning more than $5.7 billion to shareholders over that time.","As this current cyclical downturn accelerated, however, Diamond decided not to pay a special dividend. Instead, the company elected to retain cash in order to maintain Diamond's financial strength and to position the company to be ready to act if rig acquisition opportunities presented themselves.","While Diamond has been able to secure long term contracts for its newest deepwater rigs prospects have been far more challenging for its mid-water fleet. Diamond expects newer rigs to continue to compete aggressively against lower spec units. As a result of the increased competition and dramatically reduced rig chartering opportunities for mid-water rigs, this quarter Diamond decided to cold stack or scrap eight of those rigs that have no foreseeable employment prospects.","We have no doubt that Diamond will withstand the cyclical downturn and we hope and expect that the company will emerge having found opportunities to acquire good assets at attractive prices. But as of today, we are not aware of any distressed asset available for sale at prices even close to a price we will be willing to pay. Hopefully that situation will change in the next several quarters and when it does, Diamond will be ready.","Now let's turn to CNA. The company had a good quarter producing an 18% year-over-year jump in net operating income. The results were helped by lower catastrophe losses and strong investment income from limited partnerships.","More importantly, management continues to focus on margin improvement in its core P&C business. While there is more to be done, we\u2019re pleased with CNA steady progress.","For the coming year, CNA will be operating in the market where rate increases are likely to be relatively modest and investment income will be constrained by the low interest rate environment. CNA will remain focused on improving its underwriting capabilities in its commercial segment maintaining its leadership position in its specialty segment, and prudently managing its long term care book of business.","At Boardwalk over the last 15 months, the company has secured an extraordinary $1.6 billion in organic capital projects. These projects are backed by long term agreements that are expected to generate double-digit unlevered returns once completed in the next two to four years.","Since the projects will not come online immediately, Boardwalk raised a $116 million in equity to help fund its capital expenditures this year and to manage its leverage. Maintaining its credit quality will be a key focus for Boardwalk during the build out phase of these projects.","Last but not least, let's turn to Loews Hotels. The hits just keep on coming for our hotel companies. Since the beginning of the year, the company opened the Loews Chicago Hotel and it's completed the acquisition of the 155 room Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco which has been proudly remained for Loews Regency, San Francisco.","New additions to the hotel company continue to be well received especially our newest hotel in Orlando, The Cabana Bay Beach Resort, which has been growing gangbusters since it's opened a year ago in March. If you haven't visited one of hotels in Orlando, you should.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to David.","David Edelson","Thank you, Jim and good morning. Loews reported income from continuing operations of $109 million or $0.29 per share for this year's first quarter down from $265 million or $0.68 per share in the first quarter of 2014.","Diamond Offshore reported sharply lower earnings this year only partially offset by earnings improvements at CNA and Boardwalk. As I will discuss more fully, unusual items affected earnings comparisons at both Diamond Offshore and Boardwalk.","Loews net income which reflects the impact of $206 million loss from discontinued operations in last year's first quarter, was up year-over-year. As a reminder, last year\u2019s loss from discontinued operations related primarily to the sale by CNA financial of its life insurance subsidiary.","CNA contributed $202 million to Loews' income from continuing operations in this year\u2019s first quarter as compared to $176 million in the first quarter of 2014. These amounts exclude after-tax realized gains of $8 million this year versus $24 million last year.","The increase in CNA's net operating income was attributable to two main factors, number one higher net investment income driven by limited partnership investments and two higher P&C underwriting income driven by lower catastrophe losses and improved non-cat accident year results.","During the first quarter, CNA paid a $2 per share special dividend and a $0.25 per share regular quarterly dividend. At quarter end, after the payment by CNA of over $600 million of shareholder dividends, the company's capital and liquidity positions remain rock solid.","Diamond Offshore contributed a loss of $126 million to our first quarter net income, down from an earnings contribution of $69 million last year. Diamond's first quarter results include an after-tax impairment charge of $319 million of which $158 million flow through our net income.","The charge resulted from Diamond's decision to impair eight of its lower spec rates, seven mid-water semi submersibles and an older drill ship. Diamond announced that it plans to scrap three of the seven mid-water units being impaired.","Additionally, Diamond booked a restructuring charge in this year's first quarter that reduced Loews net income by $2.3 million. Absent the impairment and restructuring charges, Diamond's contribution to our net income declined from $69 million last year to $34 million this year.","Lower rig utilization negatively affected rig operating income. In addition, depreciation expense was up from last year because of new rigs having being placed into service.","Boardwalk pipeline contributed $25 million to Loews with net income during Q1 2015 up from a loss of $18 million last year. The loss last year included a $55 million after-tax charge related to the write-off of all capitalized cost associated with the former Bluegrass project.","Absent this charge, Boardwalk's contribution to our earnings decreased primarily due to lower EBITDA and higher depreciation. The EBITDA decline stem from lower revenue from transportation, park and loan and storage, attributable in large part to warmer winter weather this year versus last in Boardwalk's market areas.","During the first quarter and into early April, Boardwalk sold $7 million common units under its equity distribution program. Net proceeds to Boardwalk were $116 million including the general partner contribution.","Boardwalk sold the equity to manage its capital ratios during a period when it is spending capital on projects that are not yet in service and thus not producing EBITDA. In keeping with its focus on capital management, we anticipate that Boardwalk will drove down its $300 million subordinated debt facility from Loews later this year.","Loews Hotels generated net income of $5 million during the first quarter up from $3 million last year. Adjusted EBITDA, which you can find in the earnings snapshot posted on our website, was $35 million during the first quarter versus $24 million in the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by Loews' Hotels property at Universal Orlando, including The Cabana Bay Beach Resort as well as improved performance at various other properties.","As Jim mentioned, during the first four months of 2015 we invested over $300 million in Loews Hotels to finance the all equity acquisitions of the Loews Chicago and Loews Regency, San Francisco hotels. Overtime, those hotels will likely put leverage on these properties and may if appropriate, bring in equity partners.","Turning to the parent company. After-tax investment income declined from $34 million in 2014 to $19 million in 2015, driven by reduced performance from equities partially offset by higher returns from the parent company limited partnership portfolio.","At quarter end, cash and investments totaled $5.5 billion, as compared to $5.1 billion at the end of December. Over $4 billion of our cash and investments were in treasury bills and notes and other short term instruments which given the current interest rate environment earn us very little but provides strong liquidity.","We received $567 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter, which broke down as follows; $545 million in regular and special dividends from CNA, $9 million from Diamond and $13 million from Boardwalk.","As for returning capitals to our shareholders, during the first quarter we paid $23 million in cash dividends and spent $71 million buying back $1.8 million shares of our common stock. We also spent $24 million during the quarter buying just over 900,000 shares of Diamond stock taking our ownership to 53.1%.","I will now hand the call back to Jim.","Jim Tisch","Thank you, David. Before we open up the call to questions, let me summarize how we think about each one of our businesses. As I said six months ago, trouble is opportunity when it comes to the offshore drilling market.","The market is certainly challenged but Diamond is positioned to withstand this downturn and hopefully sees opportunities as they arise. CNA is improving its underwriting performance and maintaining a stellar balance sheet.","Diamond is repositioning its operations to align with the evolution of the U.S. natural gas marketplace and Loews Hotel is adding to its presence in key markets with exciting potential.","We continue our commitment to pursuing a value oriented investment strategy and to creating a diverse portfolio of solid businesses. As always, Loews' is focused on managing capital to achieve the best long term return for our shareholders. We found the disciplined capital management, coupled with a diverse portfolio of businesses is an exceptional way to create value over time.","Now I'd like to turn the call back to Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Jim. Lori, we're ready to start the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel at Janney Capital.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning, Loews. What's behind the thought process using the Regency brand name for San Francisco and are there other hotels that you might want to consider to rebrand to I assume that's a preferred segment?","Jim Tisch","So we have the Loews Regency in New York which is a hotel that is of a higher quality than the Loews Hotel brands. And when we had the opportunity to acquire the former Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco, we decided that that would be a good place to extend the Loews Regency brand. So voila you see that we now have two Loews Regency Hotels.","If we have the opportunity going forward to create more Loews Regency Hotels, we certainly like to do that.","Bob Glasspiegel","But there are no other candidates from your installed base of hotels that compare with these two in your mind?","Jim Tisch","No, no. No, there are no plans to upgrade any of our hotels to the Loews Regency brand.","Bob Glasspiegel","Okay. You've been prescient in one respect of saying troubles ahead in the offshore drilling marketplace for a couple of years and I was thinking the opportunities would be near for Diamond than I think you just suggested in the call today. What sort of macro variables should we be looking at to see that that would be a time that Diamond would become more active to benefit from the carnage?","Jim Tisch","I think right now the conditions are bad enough for rig valuations to go down. The problem is they haven't been bad enough for long enough. There are people who either have rigs chartered, so they are not feeling any pressure. There are people who may have loss charters or who have rigs that are unchartered now, that are feeling a lot of pressure. But interest rates are low and at least for the next few months they are able to get by.","People that have rigs that are scheduled to come out of the shipyard, many of them have delayed the arrival of those ships. But there is no doubt in my mind that as the charter market remains a vast desert for these fifth and sixth generation rigs, that the carrying cost of the rigs which is both the interest that they have to \u2013 that owners have to pay on their debt and additionally the staffing cost for these rigs which can be as much as $2 million to $3 million a month that will start to weigh on the owners.","And at that point, in the next two, three or four quarters, I think we could see that some fifth and six generation rig assets become available for sale.","Bob Glasspiegel","So it sounds like we're a couple of years away from seeing \u2013 ","Jim Tisch","Or at least the number of quarters.","Bob Glasspiegel","Right. How many shares of Diamond do you now own?","Jim Tisch","We own about 53% of Diamond.","Bob Glasspiegel","I got that. But do you have the absolute number of shares?","Jim Tisch","Yes, we will get it for you, it's probably $73 million - $73.9 million - $72.9 million, yes.","Bob Glasspiegel","Thank you.","Jim Tisch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Yes, good morning everyone. So I think maybe a year or two ago in a question about making acquisitions during what has been variable market, you said that while back five, six, seven years ago public equities were very cheap it didn't necessarily feel that way for private equities. And Loews and if I'm incorrectly stating anything please correct me. You like to take a controlling stake or a complete ownership so private equity is really the avenue you'd like to pursue.","I'm wondering if you can update given the amount of cash you have on the balance sheet your view on what opportunities there are out there private versus public and how you feel broadly about the next Loews acquisition?","Jim Tisch","So, I don't recall the comments that I made, I\u2019m sure that I made it. Let me just talk about where I think the market is right now. I think that after all these years of low interest rates and quantitative easing, what we have is markets both fixed income and equity markets that are priced for perfection.","Stocks are almost at new highs, the NASDAQ reached new highs last week, the S&P is within a shot of it. Today as we speak, the market multiple is I don\u2019t know 16, 17, 18 times earnings.","When you look at companies that are auctioned in the private equity world, what I would say is that 10 is the new 6 and what that means is in the old days when companies would trade at an EBITDA multiple of six times, today that number is 10 times.","And yes, interest rates are low but still it seems to me that even though you can finance at low rates, there just isn't enough room for return for the equity holder at these kinds of valuations. So, my guess is that for the time being businesses look like they're priced too high for us.","Now one of the things that I always remember is that the world is cyclical. And it's easy to lose sight of that because we're now in - firmly in year six of an upcycle for equity prices.","But at some point in time something will happen, people will lose all the confidence that they have and my guess is that opportunities will present itself. Like I said for offshore drilling, it could be a while and offshore drilling it's the next several quarters in the market for businesses, it could be in the next several years.","But I'd rather be patient and get a good business at an attractive price rather than lose patience and buy a business at too higher price.","Josh Shanker","And is there any way that you can use expensive dollars to buy something overseas as opposed to being here in the states or where your appetite is ultimately?","Jim Tisch","No, we\u2019re happy to buy businesses here that have foreign operations. I think it's a much bigger leap to buy a business based in a foreign country. First of all, we keep scoring dollars, secondly it\u2019s the - foreign markets are markets that don't scare by the same token, we\u2019re not fully familiar with the rules, regulations, customs and taxation. And so our hunting ground is primarily in the United States.","Josh Shanker","That's perfect. Thank you, Jim. I look forward to a press release but I can't imagine when it will come. Take care.","Jim Tisch","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Michael Millman of Millman Research Associates.","Michael Millman","Thank you. So continuing on the same theme on the macro, what price does crude have to get to or oil have to get to before I guess the blood rushing in the industry?","Jim Tisch","WTI is currently at about $59 a barrel. Brent is $66 a barrel. I think here at the price where investment starts to make sense for offshore and onshore drilling. But there is something else I think that has to happen in order for investment to pick-up and that is that I think people have gone want to see how volatile prices are.","So will prices be at $59 a month from now, will they be at $49 if there are $49, then there is still lot of volatility in the marketplace then I think you are not going to see confident comeback to the market.","On the other hand, if $59 on WTI and $66 on Brent is the new normal and we will see that over the coming few months, then I think you will start to see some glimmers of drilling. But there is a lot of headwinds for the market.","Number one, we have thousands of wells in the United States that have been drilled that have not yet been tracked. Number two, we have very high levels of oil in storage in United States beyond the normal levels, and so I think that there is a distinct possibility that those headwinds can be a real hindrance to prices moving up more from here.","Michael Millman","Moving up much more from here in the next year, the next decade?","Jim Tisch","Six months, or so.","Michael Millman","And how do you - ","Jim Tisch","One other thing, and that is there is a real distinction between drilling for oil and shale formations and drilling for it offshore. When you drill for oil in shale, it can be as little as two months between the time that you make the investment decision, until the time that you start production.","And so, it's relatively - and you also have a very good sense of exactly how much oil you are going to be able to produce from that shale well. So with prices at $59 a barrel, you are able to pretty effectively hedge your first several years of production, which makes all the difference in terms of the economics of your well.","So there is, remember, I am sure shale production its two months from the time you decide to drill until the time you\u2019re producing. For offshore drilling, its two to five years from the time you decide to drill until the time that you can be producing.","So, the offshore guys are much less concerned about the spot price for oil and much more concerned about what the trend is going to be. They don't know nearly as well how much oil they are going to be able to produce from that well that they may drill in the next year and they have got to all manner of completion so they don't know exactly when the oil is going to be produced.","So it's much more difficult for them to hedge their production than it is for the onshore shale people.","Michael Millman","How much shale oil is available or put another way why would offshore drill unless they thought that the oil shale was going to be there out?","Jim Tisch","So, offshore production is about $20 barrels a day and it is a very important part of total worldwide oil production. Shale production is probably under $5 million barrels a day. So, shale production just cannot make up for the production that takes place offshore, that\u2019s number one.","Number two, when you look at breakeven rates, you see that offshore oil drilling in many theatres is very competitive with the economics of shale production. So there is no doubt in my mind that moving forward we\u2019ll continue to see shale drilling and shale production and we\u2019ll continue to see offshore drilling and offshore production.","Michael Millman","To switch a little bit I know it's very helpful, on hotels can you envision the hotel business generating anything near what your oil-related businesses generate?","Jim Tisch","I don't know. All I know is that the business has been growing very rapidly. Recently we have added hotel, we have added two hotels in Chicago, Minneapolis, Washington DC, Boston, Orlando, Hollywood, San Francisco and there is one more on the boards for Orlando.","We've seen a significant increase in EBITDA and hopefully earnings will soon follow. So I think you\u2019re seeing a rejuvenation of the Loews Hotels brand name and we\u2019ll just see how we are able to do going forward.","Michael Millman","Do you envision the hotels generating 10% of total revenue and if so when so?","Jim Tisch","You're talking about far in the future, and I just don\u2019t know.","Michael Millman","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] ","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mary Skafidas. Please go ahead.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Kristy, and good morning everyone. A copy of the Loews' earnings release, earnings supplement, and company overview may be found on our Web site, loews.com.","On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Edelson. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward-looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those made or implied in any forward-looking statements due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings.","Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is only a brief summary of the company's statutory forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included in the company's filings with the SEC.","During the call today, we might also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our security filings and earnings supplement for a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.","In a few minutes, our CFO, David Edelson will walk you through the key drivers for the quarter. Before he does, Jim Tisch, our CEO, will kick off our call. Jim, over to you.","Jim Tisch","Thank you, Mary. Loews had a strong quarter and a good year, with each of our subsidiaries contributing to our overall success. Our CFO, David Edelson, will go into the details about our results later in the call, as well as discussing the implications of the recently-passed tax cuts for Loews and our subsidiaries. Before he does however, I'd like to talk about CNA and share repurchases. CNA has steadily improved over the past 15 years under a series of strong leadership teams. The company has taken steps to focus on its core competencies in commercial property casualty insurance by transforming itself from a not-so-focused multi-line insurance company into a highly-focused commercial property casualty company.","This transformation obviously didn't happen overnight, and in fact, it required enormous effort and discipline by the management teams at both CNA and Loews. Specifically, from 1999 to 2010, CNA disposed of a number of its businesses including reinsurance, personal automobile insurance, life insurance, and group health. Additionally, the company reinsured its asbestos and pollution liabilities to reduce balance sheet risk.","Since joining the company in November of 2016 as CEO, Dino Robusto has turbocharged CNA's evolution. On his leadership the CNA team has been pulling a number of levers to improve underwriting performance. They have enhanced risk selection, retooled their claims department, and continue to upgrade their underwriting talent.","CNA has provided a stable market for agents and brokers, a factor in the company's ability to strengthen its relationships with distributors in a time of industry change. And the company has focused intently on reducing its expense ratio while also investing in the business. Dino and the team at CNA believe that there is even more room for improvement in each of these areas, and we agree. Also, CNA continues to actively manage its long-term care book of business, mitigating risk by diligently managing claims, and obtaining rate increases from state regulators when necessary. Additionally, CNA is exploring new strategies to lessen the effects of rate increases on policy holders.","On the talent front, CNA added significantly to its bench in 2017 across many areas, including underwriting, technology, operations, and claims. All of these new senior executives are highly successful industry veterans with outstanding track records and expertise. Earlier today, in light of CNA's 2017 results, its fortress balance sheet, and the CNA board's outlook, CNA announced a $0.30 quarterly dividend as well as a $2.00 special dividend. In March of this year, Loews will receive $558 million in dividends from CNA. And over the last four years, including the upcoming March dividend payment, Loews will have received $3.2 billion in dividends from CNA.","As we look back over the last decade CNA's success comes as no surprise to Loews. Although we understood that it would take time and lots of hard work to turn CNA around, we had a vision for what the company could be and held steadfast to that vision. Also, and very importantly, we were able to recruit the right CEO for each stage of CNA's evolution. To sum up, we believe that the company is poised to continue to profitably and responsibly grow its business. And that moving forward, CNA can and will deliver even stronger operating results.","Moving on from CNA, I want to give a quick update on share repurchases. In the fourth quarter of 2017 we repurchased 4.6 million Loews shares at a cost of about $230 million. This trend continued into the first quarter of 2018 when we purchased another 4.3 million shares through February 9th, with the benefit of 20\/20 hindsight we could have bought in more shares over the last two years. However, since the third quarter, we've bought back almost nine million shares representing almost 3% of the company. We began repurchasing our stock because of the wide discount between the stock price and our assessment of the intrinsic sum-of-the-parts valuations.","Additionally, we believe that CNA will continue to grow and prosper, and that the outlook for our four other businesses is improving. Looking beyond the past year or two, in the past decade we have acquired almost 40% of our outstanding shares, continuing our nearly half-century practice of substantial share repurchases.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to David.","David Edelson","Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. We reported fourth quarter net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share, up from $290 million or $0.86 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Included in our fourth quarter net income was a $200 million net benefit related to the passage in December of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. The benefit, which had no cash impact, stems largely from the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liability.","Absent the $200 million benefit, our net income was $281 million or $0.83 per share, down $9 million from last year's fourth quarter. Before I discuss the drivers of fourth quarter net income, I'd like to draw your attention to page seven of our earnings release and page five of our earnings supplement, where we show the impact of tax reform by reporting segment for the fourth quarter and full-year.","Let me briefly summarize the impact by segment. CNA booked a charge in the fourth quarter as it wrote down its deferred tax asset due to the lower tax rate. In 2018 and beyond, tax reform should be quite positive for CAN. For Diamond itself tax reform had offsetting impacts. The company benefited as it wrote down its deferred tax liability because of the lower tax rate, while it also took a charge for the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. I would note that this charge had no cash impact. At the Loews level however we did book a charge in the Diamond segment reflecting the impact of changing tax rates on the differential between our book basis and tax basis in Diamond. As a reminder, Diamond is not included in our consolidated tax return.","For Boardwalk, Loews booked a substantial benefit as the lower tax rate caused us to write down the deferred tax liability we had built up over the past decade from Boardwalk's capital projects. And for those hotels we also benefited from the lower tax rate through the write-down of a deferred tax liability. Going forward, excluding any changes in marketplace behavior, corporate tax reform especially the reduction in the federal corporate rate should be positive for Loews on a consolidated basis.","Turning to the quarter, rather than plough through each segment's year-over-year quarterly variance, let me instead highlight the key drivers of fourth quarter earnings and what caused the slight decline from Q4 2016. These highlights will exclude the previously noted impact of tax reform. Diamond Offshore drove our slight year-to-year earnings decline with net income contribution down $74 million from Q4 2016.","Contract drilling revenues were up 12%, and rig margin declined substantially, largely due to fewer rigs working and lower day rates on re-contracted rigs. In addition, during the quarter the company impaired one of its rigs and booked restructuring and separation costs as it continues to [technical difficulty] expense base.","On the bright side, CNA had a strong quarter to top off a strong year. Its quarterly net income contribution was up $54 million year-over-year, driven mainly by a substantial increase in underwriting income. CNA posted a combined ratio of 94 in Q4 2017, down from 99.9 in last year's fourth quarter. As a reminder, when it comes to combined ratios lower is better. Excluding catastrophe losses and prior year development, the underlying combined ratio improved, from 98.3 to 95.8. And for the full-year, the underlying combined ratio was 95.5, down 2.4 points from 97.9 in 2016. Jim mentioned the focus at CNA on underwriting excellence as the key lever to improving underwriting profitability. The fourth quarter and full-year combined ratios demonstrate the progress being made.","Another bright spot was Loews Hotels, which posted net income of $13 million in Q4, up from $5 million last year. The joint ventures at the Universal Orlando Resort posted excellent results, as did the Loews Miami Beach, which was just completely a renovation during last year's fourth quarter. As Jim outlined during last quarter's remarks, Loews Hotels appears to be hit its stride operationally and strategically.","Boardwalk's contribution to our net income was essentially flat on the quarter as were the earnings generated by the parent company investment portfolio. Corporate, which includes our newest subsidiary Consolidated Container, improved versus the prior year largely due to the timing of compensation accruals.","Let me now turn to a brief review of the drivers of our full-year results. Loews reported 2017 net income of 1.16 billion or $3.45 per share, up from 654 million or $1.93 per share last year. Excluding the 200 million net benefit related to tax reform, our net income was 964 million or $2.86 per share, up 310 million from the prior year.","Again rather than walk through each segment in detail, let me highlight a few key drivers of the substantially year-over-year increase. Lower rig impairments at Diamond offshore accounted for 235 million of the earnings improvement. Excluding impairments, Diamond's earnings contribution declined 40 million year-over-year reflecting the weaker operating environment and some unusual items.","CNA in the aggregate accounted for 105 million of the increase attributable mainly to improvements in non-cat underwriting income and life and group results. Additionally, 2016 results were impacted by adverse development related to the 2010 last portfolio transfer. Net investment income and realized gains were also up over the prior year.","Partially offsetting these improvements were elevated catastrophes losses in 2017 given the high incidence of natural catastrophes during the year. Loews Hotels contributed to the net income increase thanks to improving operating performance and a gain on the sale of a joint venture hotel property in 2017. Boardwalk's net income contribution was essentially flat year-over-year. However, absent the loss Boardwalk took in 2017 on the sale of a processing facility, its net income contribution would have been up $12 million.","Parent company net investment income was flat year-over-year, and the elevated cost in corporate and other for full-year 2017 are almost entirely attributable to cost incurred in connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Container. We continue to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled 4.9 billion with 57% in cash and equivalent, 20% in LP investments, 13% mixed maturities and 10% marketable equity securities.","During the fourth quarter, we received 86 million in dividend from our subsidiaries, 73 million from CNA, and 13 million from Boardwalk. For the full-year, we received total dividend of 804 million from CNA and Boardwalk with CNA contributing the lion share of that amount. Today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.30 quarterly dividend. Combining the two, Loews will receive approximately 560 million in dividend from CNA this quarter.","As Jim mentioned, we repurchased 4.6 million shares in the fourth quarter for $231 million. Since year end, we have repurchased an additional 4.3 million shares for $218 million. Shares outstanding adjusted for all share repurchase activity currently stand at around 328 million.","I will now hand the call back to Jim.","Jim Tisch","Thank you, David. Before I turn the call back to Mary, I want to reflect on the fact that one of the most important responsibilities that we have at Loews is the selection of CEOs for our underlying business, and I cannot think of a time in Loews' history when we have had a more talented and effective group of such individuals.","As already mentioned, Dino Robusto's super-charged performance at CAN; needless to say, we are thrilled with his leadership and the direction in which he is taking the company. All of our CEOs are equally outstanding. Marc Edwards at Diamond continues to expertly steer the company through a protracted downturn in the offshore drilling industry maintaining Diamond's financial stability while differentiating the company from its competition.","Stan Horton at Boardwalk is one of the best CEOs in the midstream market. With his strategic vision and deep industry knowledge, Boardwalk is working to mitigate its re-contracting risks while adding profitable organic growth projects. Sean Fallmann, the CEO of our newest subsidiary CCC, has demonstrated his forward-looking approach and extensive expertise in the packaging industry, and we have great expectations for his leadership of the company.","And finally, we have the highest level of confidence in Jon Tisch, the CEO of Loews Hotels. Under Jon, Loews Hotels has embarked upon a new strategic direction by focusing on what we do best, group travel and immersive destinations. While Loews is the holding company, we don't have a lot of bureaucracy. We put the right people in leadership positions at our subsidiaries and let them do their jobs. Where we have engaged with our subsidiaries are the areas where we think we can add value, such as major capital allocation decisions, accessing the capital markets, and the ratification of our subsidiaries' mid to long-term strategies. This approach has served Loews shareholders very well over the past 50 years, and we expect it to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.","And now, back to Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Jim.","Kristy, we're ready for the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Michael Millman with Millman Research.","Michael Millman","Thank you. So want to talk about a little -- your intrinsic value, what's that based on? Related to that, you have for -- you have past 12 months or more said that the -- you thought the equity market was too high, and therefore you didn't want to buy back shares. The market is higher, yet you bought back shares. Kind of related to that, you or the company over the past several months has bought a lot of GE, for example, and kind of wondered if you thought that either the market was going up even more or GE was hugely undervalued?","Jim Tisch","So, first things first, I don't want to comment on the stock price of General Electric. There are lots of people that are doing it, and I don't think that it's my place as a director to be doing that. With respect to Loews, in fact I mentioned specifically in my remarks that we look at the intrinsic sum of the parts value. And what that means is that we look at what we think are the values of each of our subsidiaries. We take a lot into account in doing that. We look at what the market price of the subsidiaries are, we look at what the prospects are, we try to assess whether we think the market is right or wrong in its assessment of the value of the companies. We look at the value of our nonpublic subsidiaries, hotels, and CCC, and the Boardwalk general partner. And we put all that into our thinking and calculations, and come out with a value that we think the whole company is worth. And when it gets to the right level of -- when the company gets the right level of discount then we feel comfortable buying the shares. And, starting in the fourth quarter, we felt comfortable doing that.","Michael Millman","So, your comfort was to some extent or the difference was to some extent based upon what the market was doing. Thus I assume that you thought that market price was reasonable, no longer overpriced. Is that a fair assumption of what you're saying, a fair\u2026","Jim Tisch","No, I'm not -- do not mistake our repurchase of Loews shares for giving any guidance as to our view of the level of the stock market. I'm not making any statement about that. We just felt comfortable repurchasing our own shares at these levels.","Michael Millman","I see. And then to switch, another question, if I may, sort of on DO, the prices for oil are going up, are you seeing any demand for drilling or are those prices really based upon a reduction in production?","Jim Tisch","So, in fact we are seeing just the beginning of some green shoots in the offshore drilling garden. We're seeing it specifically for more [ph] rigs. We're seeing it in Asia, in Australia, and also in the North Sea. And what I think is happening is that there was extensive scrapping of rigs in that space, and then just a little bit of increase in demand. The demand is there I think because the projects that we're doing where we're seeing work are development projects where there can be a quick payback to the capital investment in the project. My strong guess is that in the coming year we're also going to start to see a pickup in enquiry for drill ships which generally tend to do work that takes longer to generate cash returns for the oil companies.","But there's no doubt that they have seriously underinvested in productive oil capacity. And I think the move up in oil prices reflects that underinvestment in productive capacity. And my general guess is that oil will continue to move up, tempting oil companies to start to spend more on their exploration and production.","Michael Millman","Great. Thank you very much.","Jim Tisch","Our pleasure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Yes, thank you. So, Jim, can we talk a little about dividends from Consolidated Container, whether or not you want them to reinvest their earnings into the company, and who pays for bolt-ons in that business as it goes forward?","Jim Tisch","So, CCC is doing very well. They have their own development people that go out and look for deals. There are two that are in the process of being done now. CCC will be able to finance those transactions with its own balance sheet and using the loan that was used to purchase CCC. So we do not anticipate that the current transactions under consideration will rely on the Loews treasury for financing.","David Edelson","And, Josh, I would just remind that we -- when I think in our second quarter call, when we first talked about CCC, we mentioned that we did not expect to receive dividends from CCC initially because we expected them to use their cash flow to either pay down debt or do these sorts of bolt-on acquisitions.","Josh Shanker","And are there some acquisitions that are large in nature that would require you to loan further money to CCC to do them or the strategy is that they'll all be self financed?","Jim Tisch","No, it's possible that there could be acquisitions that would require some equity funding from Loews, but we're very comfortable doing that. We have a lot of confidence in the management, in the company, and the industry.","Josh Shanker","And when do you think that you would look to all the investment mature such that you'll receive dividends from it?","Jim Tisch","I don't know. We've got to see what's available in the marketplace; we got to see how their own organic growth is going. There are just an awful lot of factors. But what I do know is that we're pleased with where CCC is, its position in the industry, the maturity of its management, and the opportunity set that they're seeing. But just because there's an opportunity set doesn't necessarily mean that transactions will get completed, but they're working hard to do that.","David Edelson","But if they can use their free cash flow to invest at attractive returns on invested capital then we're happy to have them do that.","Josh Shanker","All right. And then when I look at noncore -- I guess the non mostly owned companies, that CCC, Hotels, CNA, Boardwalk, and Diamond out of the picture, do you have any thoughts on how I might benchmark performance for the Loews investment portfolio, and any recommendations to track performance over time and whether you're doing a good job or whatnot?","Jim Tisch","We have -- all right, let's talk about what we have in the Loews portfolio. We have $250 million of equities; we have another billion dollars or so of hedge funds. My guess is it's very difficult for you as an investor to be able to track those, but what I can tell you is that their performance is doing reasonably well. Our equities this past year I think exceeded the S&P 500 better than a lot of mutual funds I know. And we are very, very comfortable and pleased with our asset managers.","Josh Shanker","And in terms -- would you be interested in providing disclosure that would help us track it over time? Is there any like sort of way you think that we can play with the numbers you give up to sort of track it?","Jim Tisch","Josh, we're a $15 billion company. We have a portfolio of over $50 billion. You're asking us to provide more disclosure on a $250 million equity portfolio. That sounds crazy to me.","Josh Shanker","Well, I mean I'd look at it as though you have more cash -- there's billions of dollars of cash you manage on the balance sheet though.","David Edelson","Yes, but remember, on average, let's say 60% to 65% -- we're not at 57%. But 60% to 65% of it has been cash and equivalents. So you know the return we're getting on that.","Josh Shanker","Yes.","David Edelson","So when you look at the investment income generated by the parent company you can, if you wanted to, you could assume what we're earning on our cash, and then you could intuit what the yield or what the earnings are on the remainder.","Josh Shanker","All right, I'll give it a try. Thank you very much for the answers.","David Edelson","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning, Loews.","Jim Tisch","Good morning, Janney.","Bob Glasspiegel","The hotels, you're excited about the strategic direction. You had a really nice earnings and EBITDA improvement. And I know the earnings don't always match the sort of underlying dynamics in that business, but are we in a position where we're going to start to see a similar sort of growth as we had this quarter, seems like the tax rate will be able to help on your after tax earnings. Just some general comments about where we're going from a reported basis, and what are the strategic positives that the Jon is bringing?","David Edelson","Well, you're talking about hotels specifically, Bob?","Bob Glasspiegel","Hotels, yes.","David Edelson","Okay. Yes, I mean, you saw the quarter, you saw the year. I think we've talked in the past, and you can see in the company in the material that we've put out today that we have a number of hotels in the offing in Kansas City, Arlington, Texas, St. Louis, in Orlando itself, again adding to the Universal Orlando joint venture. We only have one new hotel opening in 2018. That's a hotel at Universal Orlando. So the benefits of some of the exciting developments underway won't be shown really in our financial statements for another few years. You will see the opening dates on those properties and of course their pre-opening and those sorts of things associated with them as well. So, yes, we are building momentum, but always tempered by the fact that some of these growth projects are a couple of years out.","Jim Tisch","Robert, let me add a little to provide a little bit depth to that. In my comments, I said that we are focusing on what we do best at Loews Hotels, group travel and immersive destinations. Kansas City is all about group travel. We are going to have an 800 room hotel atop - or alongside the Kansas City Convention Center. We will be the newest hotel in Kansas City in decades. Newest Convention Hotel and we expect that hotel to do very well as a major regional convention center hotel. We think that the demand is built in by the location and the newness of the hotel. In Arlington, St. Louis and Orlando, that's all about immersive destination that there are -- those are venues where we believe people will naturally gravitate, want to go to. And for all of those, we see the hotels that we are building as hotels that can cater to the people that coming to these locations.","The strategy has been proven to us many times over in Orlando and also in Miami Beach where we are able to achieve especially in Orlando occupancy rates and room rates that is substantially above what is available to others in the market. And we think there is a good opportunity for that to occur in the other immersive destinations in which we are building. The problem is that you can't build a hotel overnight. It takes some time. And so, these hotels won't be coming online in '18. Some of them will just be starting up in 2019. So, it will take some time to show up in the numbers.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good, long answer. I appreciate it. Tax rate that's gone down to 20s or is there something that should we thinking about differently?","David Edelson","Well, we are consolidated with all but Diamond. And so, I think we do benefit from the lowering of the corporate tax rate. But, CNA is a big piece of that.

(Operator instructions.) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mary Skafidas, Vice President of Investor and Public Relations. You may begin.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Paula, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the Loews Corporation Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of our earnings release and earnings snapshot may be found on our website www.loews.com.","On the call this morning we have our Chief Executive Officer Jim Tisch and our Chief Financial Officer David Edelson. Following our prepared remarks this morning we will have a question-and-answer session.","Before we begin however I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward-looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those projections made in any forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is only a brief summary of the company\u2019s statutory forward-looking statements disclaimer which is included in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC.","During the call today we might also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our security filings for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.","I will now turn the call over to Loews\u2019 Chief Executive Officer Jim Tisch.","Jim Tisch","Good morning and thank you for joining us on our call today. In Q3 Loews had net income from continuing operations of $179 million or $0.47 per share compared to $318 million or $0.82 per share for Q3 2013. The main causes of this decline were results at CNA and at the parent company\u2019s investment portfolio. Our CFO David Edelson will provide more detail in his remarks.","Before reviewing key developments in our businesses I want to take a moment to focus on our share repurchases. Year-to-date we have repurchased 13.6 million shares of Loews common stock for $581 million. In Q3 we repurchased 5.1 million shares and since October 1st we have repurchased an additional 4.0 million shares. ","At the holding company level share repurchases are one of the key levers we use to increase shareholder value. The other levers are investing in our subsidiaries and acquiring new businesses. Additionally as I like to say, if there\u2019s nothing to do, do nothing. We are comfortable letting our portfolio of cash and investments build if we don\u2019t see near-term opportunities.","One of the metrics we consider when thinking about Loews share repurchases is the sum of the parts calculation and especially the sum of the market values of our publicly traded parts compared to the price of Loews shares. Importantly we also assess the sum of the parts based on our own view of the intrinsic value of each of our publicly traded subsidiaries rather than just the market price.","The lower our share price relative to these valuations the more excited we are about repurchasing our shares. We try to look beyond today\u2019s market sentiment and consider the longer-term prospects for each of our businesses when we repurchase shares. We\u2019ve always believed that repurchasing our shares at prices below intrinsic value enhances the long-term value of Loews common stock. Our share repurchases have greatly contributed to the significant long-term outperformance of our stock versus the S&P 500.","Now let\u2019s take a look at the performance of our subsidiaries. At CNA the company remains focused on improving underwriting results even as rate increases become less robust across the commercial property\/casualty market. Both CNA Specialty and CNA Commercial improved their underlying loss and combined ratios versus the prior year, although operating income decreased for reasons David Edelson will explain shortly.","CNA\u2019s management team continues to take underwriting actions to improve profitability in CNA Commercial, with the goal of CNA eventually becoming a top quartile underwriter. CNA Specialty, which represents almost half of CNA\u2019s P&C net premiums continues to perform quite well.","CNA\u2019s balance sheet reflects its financial strength and stability. With $11.4 billion of statutory surplus and $13.0 billion of GAAP equity the company\u2019s capital position has never been stronger.","Turning to Diamond, the offshore drilling market continues to be challenging with day rates well off their peaks and long-term contracts few and far between. The difficult market conditions are reflected in Diamond\u2019s operating results and its decision to scrap six mid-water floaters.","That being said there is good news to report from Diamond. On October 23rd the company announced a contract with Hess Corporation for the last two of Diamond\u2019s new build drill ships \u2013 the Ocean Black Rhino and the Ocean Black Lion. The Hess contract, which was a result of Herculean efforts by Diamond\u2019s new management team, are expected to generate combined total revenue of about $1 billion and represent seven years of contract billing backlog.","With this agreement all of Diamond\u2019s new builds have been awarded long-term contracts. In addition, all four new build drill ships will be working in the US Gulf of Mexico where they will have lower operating costs than in international ultra-deepwater markets. ","Equally important, Diamond recently announced that Petrobras has extended the contracts on three ultra-deepwater semi-submersibles. These contracts are expected to generate a maximum total revenue of $1.4 billion and represent an additional nine years of contract drilling backlog. ","And finally during the quarter Diamond increased its revolving credit facility to $1.5 billion, adding flexibility to its already strong balance sheet. The goal is to position Diamond to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from the difficult conditions in the offshore drilling market.","Moving on to Boardwalk, the company continues to make headway on securing long-term commitments from customers to utilize new build pipelines connecting to end use markets. Boardwalk\u2019s pipeline project that will supply natural gas to the Freeport LNG terminal is a great example of this strategy in action.Boardwalk has entered into a twenty-year firm agreement with shippers to transport approximately 1.4 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas to the planned liquefaction terminal in Freeport, Texas. The company anticipates starting operations in 2018 and expects to earn a double-digit unlevered return on assets. Boardwalk is seeing more opportunities like the Freeport project with attractive rates of return that ultimately should position the company for growth over the long term.","Last but not least, let\u2019s turn to Loews Hotels. Loews Hotels continues to focus on building its brand and broadening its customer base through the addition of new properties in gateway cities and resort destinations. The financial results are improving nicely although that\u2019s tough to discern from our reported segment information as David will highlight.","During the quarter Loews Hotels announced that in partnership with Universal Studios, it will develop its fifth hotel in Orlando, the Loews Sapphire Falls. With this project Loews will build on its very successful 15-year partnership with Universal Studios. When the 1000-room Sapphire Falls opens in the second half of 2016 it will bring the total number of on-site hotel rooms at Universal Orlando to 5200.","As a reminder, the 400-room Loews Chicago Hotel is scheduled to open during Q1 2015. As I like to say, make your reservations now. With the addition of the Loews Chicago Hotel and the new resort in Orlando, our network will have grown from 18 hotels in 2012 to 23 hotels by the end of 2016; and in that same period the number of rooms will have increased 50% from just over 8000 to more than 12,000.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to David for more details on our Q3 results.","David Edelson","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For Q3 2014 as Jim reported, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $179 million or $0.47 per share compared to $318 million or $0.82 per share last year. Net income which includes a gain from discontinued operations of $29 million was $208 million for this year\u2019s Q3.","For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, income from continuing operations was $747 million or $1.94 per share as compared to $901 million or $2.31 per share in the prior-year period. Our earnings this quarter were negatively affected by declines at CNA, Diamond and Boardwalk as well as by lower parent company investment results.","CNA\u2019s contribution to income from continuing operations including net realized gains was $188 million in Q3 2014 versus $245 million last year. The decline was primarily attributable to lower income from LP investments, adverse prior-year development in CNA Commercial, underwriting losses at Hardy, and a loss on an annuity coinsurance transaction related to the sale during the quarter of Continental Assurance Company. These negatives were only partially offset by improved calendar year underwriting results at CNA Specialty, lower year-over-year catastrophe losses, and higher realized gains.","Diamond Offshore\u2019s contribution to income from continuing operation for Q3 2014 was $25 million compared to $44 million in the prior-year quarter. An impairment charge impacted Diamond\u2019s Q3 earnings as the company decided to retire and scrap six mid-water semi-submersible rigs. This impairment charge reduced Loews\u2019 Q3 earnings by $55 million. ","As a reminder, during last year\u2019s Q3 Diamond\u2019s earnings were impacted by lost revenue and bad debt expense as two Diamond customers experienced financial difficulty. This reduced Diamond\u2019s contribution to Loews\u2019 after-tax income in Q3 2013 by $35 million. Diamond\u2019s Q3 2014 net income also reflected higher depreciation and interest expense and an increased effective tax rate as the rig impairments did not provide a tax benefit, and separately a change in UK tax laws resulted in additional taxes. As a partial offset Diamond benefited from settling uncertain tax positions related to several foreign jurisdictions. ","Boardwalk Pipeline\u2019s contribution to income from continuing operations was $8 million I this year\u2019s Q3 as compared to $19 million in Q3 2013. The main drivers of the decline in Boardwalk\u2019s income were lower storage and parking and lending revenues as the market for these services was weak, and higher operating expenses. Additionally the gains on the sale of storage gas that were booked in Q3 2013 did not recur in Q3 2014.","Loews Hotels and Resorts contributed a diminutive amount to income from continuing operations in both Q3 2014 and the comparable quarter in 2013. Underlying earnings improvements were masked by various nonrecurring items such as costs connected to the purchase of the Loews Minneapolis and Loews Chicago O\u2019Hare properties and mortgage defeasance costs from the refinancing of Loews Miami Beach. ","Additionally Q3 2013 included a one-time gain in the sale of equity interest in the Loews Madison and Loews Boston Hotels. Stripping out these and other nonrecurring items in both years, pretax income was up almost $11 million over Q3 2013.","The $51 million decline in after-tax parent company investment income during Q3 was largely attributable to equity investments including gold-related equities as well as LP investments. ","As you recall during Q2 2014 we reported within discontinued operations a net impairment charge of $167 million related to the announced sale process for HighMount. During Q3 we recognized a $30 million positive adjustment to the previously-booked impairment charge to reflect the actual sales proceeds. HighMount\u2019s operating results for Q3 are also included in discontinued operations.","Holding company cash and investments at quarter end totaled $5.2 billion as compared to $4.9 billion at the end of June. We received $135 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in Q3 which breaks down as follows: $60 million from CNA, $62 million from Diamond, and $13 million from Boardwalk.","During the first nine months of 2013 we received $647 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, up from $547 million for the first nine months of 2013. As a reminder, CNA paid a $1 per share special dividend during this year\u2019s Q1. Cash and investments at quarter-end also reflect the net proceeds from the sale of HighMount and from the refinancing of the Loews Miami Beach Hotel.","As for returning capital to Loews shareholders we paid $24 million in cash dividends during Q3 and spent $220 million buying back 5.1 million shares of Loews common stock. We continued to purchase shares after the quarter ended. From October 1st through October 31st we bought back a further 4 million shares of Loews common stock for $166 million. On a year-to-date basis we have spent $581 million to repurchase 13.6 million shares or 3.5% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.","I will now hand the call back to Jim.","Jim Tisch","Thank you, David. Before we open up the call to questions I wanted to summarize the highlights at Loews.","For CNA it\u2019s slow and steady wins the race. CNA has posted consistent underwriting improvement and maintains a very strong capital position. At Boardwalk we are seeing growth prospects because of the increased demand for natural gas transportation as natural gas production looks to grow almost 20% by the end of the decade. ","And finally at Diamond trouble is opportunity. With day rates declining in the offshore drilling market hopefully Diamond will have occasion to grow its fleet by purchasing rigs at a discount to new build prices.","Overall there is tremendous change happening in the industries in which are businesses are operating, and we are focused on turning that change into growth opportunities that will benefit our shareholders well into the future. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Jim. This concludes our prepared remarks and we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Paula?","Question-and-Answer Session","","","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. (Operator instructions.) Your first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah, thank you very much. Jim, I\u2019m going to tell one of your stories and I\u2019m going to tell it wrong so you can fix the story and fill it in I guess. When you look at maybe it was the Majestic tankers once upon a time or the early days before Diamond was Diamond, and you saw it and you said \u201cI get all this for $10 million,\u201d or I can\u2019t remember if the number was really $25 million or whatever it was. Where are we in terms of the offshore drilling business or the natural gas pipeline business, did you look at that and say \u201cOh my God, I can\u2019t believe that you can buy this business for this cheap right now?\u201d","Jim Tisch","No, it wasn\u2019t $10 million, it wasn\u2019t $25 million \u2013 it was $5 million. And it really was a jaw-droppingly low price considering the assets we were buying. I don\u2019t anticipate that in the offshore drilling business that we\u2019re going to get to those $5 million levels, but I do see that there are new build drill ships that are scheduled to come out of the yard that don\u2019t have contracts. ","There are also a number of very highly levered also drilling contractors in the industry and it would not surprise me to see some of our competitors get into financial trouble where they are put into a position or where their lenders are put into a position that they have to sell rigs. And what Diamond has done is it has prepared itself for that possibility. ","Diamond has done this before, most recently in \u201909 when we bought two rigs out of bankruptcy court \u2013 The Courage and The Valor. Those rigs are both working profitably for Petrobras and just had their contracts renewed. ","So we\u2019re taking a wait and see attitude. Right now there\u2019s nothing to be done but it is very possible in the next six months to one, two, or three years depending on what happens to a lot of different things \u2013 there could be very interesting opportunities for Diamond.","With respect to natural gas pipelines it\u2019s a different story. We don\u2019t see the possibility at all of buying existing assets at cheap valuations. But what we do see is that there are very interesting opportunities to build new pipes to accommodate the significant increase in gas production that has to flow from the areas where the gas is being produced to the areas where the gas is actually being consumed \u2013 so that the Freeport LNG project that we actually announced this quarter is such a case where we\u2019re actually able to earn what we think will be a very attractive rate of return on assets. And with typical MLP leverage of say 50% the rate of return on equity can be significantly higher.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Those are great answers, I appreciate it. And one other answer which I imagine you\u2019re going to tell me that you\u2019re not going to tell me: you had a very wide range if you want, an idea of what you think the market value of the real estate on your balance sheet is as opposed to the balance sheet value?","Jim Tisch","So I guess what you\u2019re talking about is our hotel properties because that\u2019s pretty much all of the real estate that we have on our balance sheet. And I would say that you have to look at that on a property-by-property basis. Starting next quarter we are going to significantly improve the disclosures with respect to our hotel company, and that may be able to give you a bit of an indication of the valuations of our properties. ","Additionally if you want to think about what the valuation is, get on a plane, go down to Florida, look at our Miami Beach hotel, look at what we\u2019ve put in place at Universal Studios, remembering that we have a 50% interest. And my guess is that any good hotel person should be able to give you a good ballpark estimate of what those properties are worth.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Well I might just do that \u2013 the winter\u2019s coming so it doesn\u2019t sound like such a bad idea. Thank you very much.","Jim Tisch","My pleasure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel at Janney Capital.","Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital ","Yeah, Josh is a smart fellow there. On the HighMount sale, can you give me the pieces we should think about as it affects the sort of asset value? You\u2019ve got some cash; you\u2019ve got some deferred tax assets and you kept some properties ex the divestiture. So what are the key balance sheet items for the (q)?","Jim Tisch","Bob, the key balance sheet items are we sold HighMount in its entirety \u2013 we got cash for that. We have no properties and I don\u2019t think we booked anything in terms of taxes. We do have a tax loss carry forward that should benefit us over the next several years.","Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital ","I thought there was a deferred tax asset, David. Didn\u2019t we talk through that or am I misremembering that?","David Edelson","Yeah, that was transferred to the Loews level.","Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital ","And how much is that?","David Edelson","I\u2019m recalling I think it was about $500 million or thereabouts.","Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital ","Okay, and the cash is how much?","David Edelson","Well, the net proceeds we disclosed were $794 million and we disclosed that out of that we repaid debt of $480 million.","Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital ","Okay.","Jim Tisch","So the net amount is the difference between those two - $314 million.","Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital ","Right. And tax loss carry forwards, how big?","David Edelson","We have not disclosed that, Bob.","Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital ","Can I read that off the (q) when it comes out or that\u2019s not disclosed in the (q)?","David Edelson","No.","Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital ","Okay. Second thing \u2013 trading losses you said in the quarter were gold and what was the other contributor?","David Edelson","LP investments.","Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital ","Okay. Go ahead, I\u2019m sorry?","David Edelson","That was all of it. That really accounted for the delta between last year\u2019s Q3 and this year\u2019s Q3.","Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital ","$79 million, that\u2019s a pretty big swing just on gold and LPs.","David Edelson","Yep.","Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital ","Okay, and just finally gold, I mean oil going below $80 a barrel, Goldman saying $75. How should we think about that on your sort of portfolio of companies?","Jim Tisch","Well, we\u2019re not in HighMount anymore so it doesn\u2019t affect us there. It may have an impact in offshore drilling but I don\u2019t really think so because in offshore drilling typically oil companies are thinking three and four years out and not thinking about tomorrow. ","That\u2019s the mindset of those that are drilling for shale oil because in shale number one, you can turn the spigot on and off with respect to drilling very quickly. Number two, in the shale oil production you get a big burst of production initially and then it trails off rather quickly so that you want to make sure if you\u2019re producing shale oil, that when you frac the well and turn it on it is producing at a time when oil prices are relatively attractive.","My guess for what it\u2019s worth is that oil prices between $75 and $80 a barrel are going to have a rather significant effect on US oil production. Right now the numbers call for US oil production to increase next year by 750,000 to 1 million barrels a day \u2013 somewhere in that region. My guess, my fearless forecast is that if oil prices stay where they are you will see US production increasing by a significantly smaller amount and that\u2019s due to the fact that for shale oil producers that are not hedged in terms of their oil prices. ","They will see a very dramatic decline in their free cash flow, and to the extent that so many of them are below investment grade it\u2019ll be difficult for them to get new financing to actually pay for the cost of drilling. So I would not be surprised at all to see the [Bakers use oil drilling rig count] decline rather significantly in the coming months if oil prices stay at this level.","Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital ","Okay, that sort of sets the backdrop for the opportunities that you\u2019re maybe seeing in buying drilling rigs down the line?","Jim Tisch","No, no \u2013 when I talk about shale I\u2019m talking about land drilling. My guess though is that oil prices, current oil prices will not affect offshore drilling nearly as much as it affects the land drilling, because the horizon for a company drilling offshore prospects \u2013 the horizon is say two to five years. The horizon for somebody drilling a shale well onshore is six months to a year. So it\u2019s a dramatically different mindset between the two oil companies.","Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital ","Right, thank you.","Jim Tisch","My pleasure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Baker of Barclays Capital.","Andy Baker \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you, good morning guys. Just a question for you: so $5.2 billion of corporate cash roughly at the end of the quarter. Stock market\u2019s at an all-time high; bond yields are still really, really low. Gold\u2019s obviously had its difficulties lately. Where do you look for opportunity to earn a risk-adjusted return that you\u2019re comfortable with going forward from here?","Jim Tisch","You know, like everybody else it\u2019s really tough. With respect to stocks they are high although as I\u2019m sure you know, when you parse through the indexes you see that there are some stocks making new highs, but there are also a lot of stocks that are well below their highs and well below their intermediate-term moving averages. So the guys that are managing our equity portfolio are still finding opportunities in which to invest.","In terms of fixed income, I would say that generally we are decidedly bearish about interest rates and we\u2019re generally pretty bearish about most of the markets within the interest rate market. For example, investment-grade bonds and below-investment-grade bonds \u2013 we\u2019re not excited at all about that. We think that interest rates on these securities should be higher as should interest rates on government bonds, and it\u2019s our guess that over time that will in fact happen.","So right now for CNA we\u2019re generally keeping our fixed income portfolio in our non-matched accounts as short as we can. We\u2019re playing the roll down in the yields and we\u2019re actually hoping for a time when interest rates go higher and when we can get excited about investing in fixed income.","Andy Baker \u2013 Barclays Capital","And in terms of, obviously your primary use of cash is either make investments or buy back your own shares and buying back your own shares at a discount to its NAV is generally a very good, a big positive for NAV in general. I mean when you look forward do you develop sort of expected returns across your portfolio, across your equity portfolio and then compare the opportunity that you see externally with the opportunity you see in your own stock?","Jim Tisch","So when I think about my job description, I would say there are two words that best describe it, and that is \u201casset allocator.\u201d And what we tend to do here at Loews all the time is think about where to invest cash. We have lots and lots of different opportunities to do that. We can do that in our subsidiaries from time to the extent that they have projects that need help from us. ","We can invest in reinvesting fixed income for CNA. We\u2019re constantly looking at equity prices; we\u2019re constantly looking at rates of return that can be had on one type of investment versus another. And in fact we got out of the, the reason that we sold HighMount is because we saw the rates of return that we could achieve by putting more money into HighMount was insufficient compared to the rates of return that we could see in other areas of investment.","So we\u2019re constantly monitoring markets. We\u2019re constantly looking at corporate transactions to buy a new business. We\u2019re constantly assessing the value of Loews; we\u2019re constantly assessing the value of the stock market and the rates of return that can be available in other investments \u2013 and putting that into our heads and every day coming to decisions as to where the most attractive investments are. And share repurchases are just one part of that larger puzzle.","Andy Baker \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks, Jim. And then just lastly in the past you\u2019ve talked about maybe some broader themes that you\u2019ve sort of been inspired by or that have guided some of your investment. Anything out there that you see maybe longer-term or not so long-term that you think is an interesting sort of thesis for you to be looking at, or an investment thesis?","Jim Tisch","You know, there\u2019s nothing that really grabs me right now. I was thinking the other day, Josh previously mentioned the Jim Tisch $5 million test. And I was, separately and apart from Josh the other day I was thinking about the early \u201880s when we got into super tankers and when we were able to buy seven- or eight-year-old super tankers that had cost $15 million apiece when we were able to buy them for $5 million apiece. ","The difference then and now is that the financial markets and the investment markets are dramatically more crowded. When we bought super tankers there was nobody else looking at buying super tankers, and I contrast that to today when a few years ago when super tankers and shipping took just a little dip there were lots and lots of investors, asset managers looking to go into the market.","So the main thing that I see right now is very crowded investment markets \u2013 meaning that most of the things that we see are either fully priced or fairly priced. That\u2019s the situation today. There isn\u2019t an enormous amount of fear. There\u2019s a sense that growth will generally continue and there\u2019s just a lot of money coming into investment managers. I promise you at some point in time that will change. I just don\u2019t know or have any idea when that will be. But when we invest, we think about that possibility, we think about the downsides and we try to manage accordingly.","Andy Baker \u2013 Barclays Capital","Great, thanks a lot, Jim.","Operator","(Operator instructions.) Your next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research Associates. ","Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates ","Hi. I wanted to go back to when you were talking about oil-related investments and then hotels. Wouldn\u2019t you think that the offshore drillers would be concerned that the on-land frackers would basically create a ceiling for prices?","Jim Tisch","That is an issue but the amount of oil that is produced from onshore shale formations is relatively low compared to the amount of oil that\u2019s produced worldwide. So just rough order of magnitude there\u2019s 100 million barrels of oil a day that are produced in the world and the amount that comes from shale formations is less than 5% of that.","If you look back a few years it was dramatically lower, and the question I think you\u2019re asking is whether in the next five years, instead of being 5% that amount can be 10%, 15% or 20%. And my guess is that that will not happen, that shale is a significant factor here in the United States but it\u2019s not a significant factor in the rest of the world. ","And that has to do with a lot of things that we have here in the United States that don\u2019t obtain in the rest of the world \u2013 it has to do with the legal regime; it has to do with the fact that mineral rights are owned by the landowner, not by the state. It has to do with the entrepreneurial drive. It has to do with the fact that there is an oil service industry here that is very, very highly developed. It has to do with pipelines in place and transportation and roads, and population density. ","And again, all of those have come together here in the United States and for one reason or another tend not to exist on nearly the same scale in the rest of the world. So for the time being my guess is, my strong guess is that the shale revolution that we\u2019re seeing here in the United States will not occur in the same scale internationally; and therefore won\u2019t be a significant factor with respect to the offshore drilling markets.","Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates ","Or will occur at a much higher price I guess you\u2019re saying.","Jim Tisch","Yes, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s exactly right. If you had the same shale prospects in a foreign country, instead of the breakeven price being $75 a barrel it could easily be $150 a barrel. And those countries would have the chicken and egg problem of being able to get to the scale so that the cost of producing shale oil in those countries could come down to attractive prices. My guess is that it\u2019s going to be very hard though for them even with scale to get down to where we are here in the United States.","Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates ","Okay, thank you. On the hotels on an adjusted basis what was the pretax for nine months?","Jim Tisch","When you say \u201cadjusted basis\u201d what do you mean?","Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates ","Taking out nonrecurring items \u2013 you know\u2026","David Edelson ","I don\u2019t have that right in front of me. I\u2019ll have to get back to you.","Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates ","Okay, and maybe looking at this another way, of the 12,000 rooms what\u2019s low-share?","Jim Tisch","We\u2019ll also have to get back to you on that because not only is there the Universal partnership but there are also partnerships with respect to a number of other hotels. So we\u2019ll get back to you.","David Edelson","When we enhance our disclosure in Q4 we will attempt to address that issue because our accounting is difficult because of the JV accounting and because one quarter a hotel may be wholly owned and the next quarter it may be a JV hotel. And that makes it difficult to compare across quarters.","Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates ","I see. And maybe what\u2019s the debt that you have on the books for your hotel properties?","David Edelson","Well, we have some mortgage debt on a couple of our properties, the most significant being the Loews Miami Beach Hotel where I mentioned a refi that we put $300 million on that property \u2013 previously it had $125 million on it. There\u2019s debt on the Orlando \u2013 I believe that\u2019s in the neighborhood of, and we only have a 50% ownership there; I believe that\u2019s around $350 million or $450 million but I\u2019ll have to get back to you on that. And then there\u2019s really essentially a little bit on Philadelphia, so it\u2019s dribs and drabs after that.","Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates ","As you recognized the whole purpose is to try to backdoor the value.","David Edelson","That\u2019s why we\u2019re enhancing our disclosure, Mike, in Q4.","Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates ","Appreciate it, thank you.","Operator","This concludes the allotted time for the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s conference.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mary Skafidas, Vice President of Investor and Public Relations. Please go ahead.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Loews Fourth Quarter Earnings and Year-End 2013 Conference Call. A copy of our earnings release and earnings snapshot may be found on our website, loews.com.","On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, Peter Keegan. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call may include statements that are forward-looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those projections made in any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made, and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is only a brief summary of the company's statutory forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included in the company's filings with the SEC.","During the call today, we may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our security filings for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.","I will now turn the call over to Loews' Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch.","Jim Tisch","Thank you, Mary, and thank you for joining us on our call. Today's report contains some disappointing news. No business or industry can escape the occasional bump in the road and it just so happens that several of our companies that has bumped at the same time. But, before I share any of that news with you, I want to make clear that this quarter has not altered my view of the fundamental strength of Loews and all of our subsidiaries. I feel certain that there are smoother roads ahead. Loews maintains the strong and flexible balance sheet including significant amounts of cash, so we can manage through cyclical downturn and position ourselves and our subsidiaries for future success and long-term value creation.","Enough of the preamble, on with the call. As you have seen from our press release, Loews reported full-year 2014 net income of $597 million compared to $558 million in 2012. And likewise, for the fourth quarter, Loews reported a net of loss $198 million compared to a net loss of $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.","I want to touch on some key points and then return \u2013 then turn the call over to Pete Keegan regarding some more detail about our quarterly and full-year results which includes several unusual items.","2014 was a mixed year for our subsidiaries. It was a very good year for CNA as the company continued to improve its underwriting margins and generated its highest income since 2006. CNA's combined ratio excluding catastrophes and development improved by five points.","The statutory capital grew by 11% year-over-year and net operating income was very strong. As evidence of CNA's strong capital position and improved underwriting performance, CNA announced this morning that it has declared a special dividend of $1 per share and increased its quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share. With a quarterly dividend at that rate for the full-year 2014, Loews will receive close to $500 million in dividends from CNA alone. We are very pleased with CNA's improvement and believe that the company is well-positioned for growth and profitability.","For other subsidiaries such as Boardwalk and HighMount, the past year was challenging as both companies operated in difficult environment.","Let's start by reviewing the current space of the U.S. natural gas market, which affects both Boardwalk and HighMount. Production from shale plays such as the Marcellus and Utica shale continues to grow making more traditional natural gas plays like HighMount's Sonora field uneconomic to drill at current gas prices.","The Marcellus and Utica shale\u2019s are also having a significant impact on the economics of natural gas transportation. Natural gas was traditionally has been transported from the Gulf Coast to markets in the Northeast is being displaced in the Northeast by Marcellus and Utica Shale production. In just two years, natural gas production has grown from 16 cubic feet per day to 13 billion cubic feet per day and could exceed 25 billion cubic feet per day by 2020. As a result, dramatically less natural gas is being shipped from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Therefore, long-haul transportation rates are under pressure. And likewise, pipeline contracts are being renewed at lower prices and for shorter terms.","Increased Northeast gas production has also led to a compression of seasonal spread and reduced volatility thereby diminishing the value of natural gas storage. All of these factors are significantly impacted Boardwalk's financial performance and its ability to maintain its current distribution to shareholders.","In response to the current environment and in order to strengthen its balance sheet and better position the company for long-term growth, Boardwalk announced earlier today a reduction in its cash distribution per unit. Keep in mind that Boardwalk still generates copious amount of cash. Boardwalk has reduced its distribution not because of the company -- not because the company is financially distressed rather this action is driven by Boardwalk's desire to reduce its leverage ratio through a combination of higher EBITDA from internally funded capital projects and GAAP reduction.","The distribution reduction should also dramatically reduce the company's need to access the equity markets, which should allow Boardwalk to avoid what could be considerable dilution to all unit holders. Additionally, Loews is prepared to offer Boardwalk up to $300 million in subordinated debt to support planned growth projects in 2014.","While in the short-term, the Marcellus and Utica shale plays are creating challenges for Boardwalk. They could in the long run provide significant opportunities for growth. Boardwalk concluded its open season for the Ohio-to-Louisiana Access Project on its Texas Gas Interstate Pipeline System, which will provide natural gas transportation from the Marcellus and Utica shale through diverse delivery in markets in Louisiana. Although small, it is indicative of future opportunities that may rise from growth in the Marcellus and Utica shale play.","As Boardwalk CEO, Stan Horton mentioned on their call earlier today, the company also concluded its open season for the proposed Bluegrass project. Boardwalk continues to analyze results of the open season engage in ongoing discussion with potential customers and evaluate the projects. In the past, we have expressed our willingness to offer financial support to growth projects at Boardwalk, should Bluegrass go forward, we would expect to continue to partner with Boardwalk on this project. Loews would also consider partnering with Boardwalk on other larger opportunities.","Let's turn to HighMount. As we have mentioned for a number of quarters, HighMount operating results continue to be negatively affected by relatively low prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids as well as the lack of successful development of new proved reserves.","Both of these factors are reflected in HighMount's ceiling test impairment charge in goodwill write-down. HighMount has more than 500,000 acres in Sonora, Texas, where it has historically drilled for and produced natural gas. As you know, HighMount previously suspended its natural gas focused drilling program in Sonora and has refocused its efforts on drilling for oil, primarily in the Wolfcamp zone within its Sonora acreage.","HighMount continues its science experiments by testing landing zones, frac designs and completion technique to determine the economic viability of developing an oil drilling program in the Wolfcamp. We are hopeful that HighMount's science experiment will be successful and that the company will be able to commercially exploit the oil reserves within the Wolfcamp stay tuned.","Before turning the call over to Pete Keegan, I want to add a shameless pitch for the newly reopened Loews Regency Hotel in New York. They have truly done an incredible job, the place sparkles. Please come visit the Regency and see for yourself.","Now, over to Pete.","Peter Keegan","Thanks Jim, and good morning, everyone.","As Jim mentioned Loews Corporation today reported net income for 2013 of $595 million or $1.53 per share compared to $568 million or $1.43 per share in 2012.","For the fourth quarter of 2013, Loews reported a net loss of $198 million or $0.51 per share as compared to a net loss of $32 million or $0.08 per share in the fourth quarter of 2012. Loews' fourth quarter and full-year 2013 results included the following two unusual items. First, CNA took $123 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter related to the reinsurance contract for asbestos and pollution liabilities that was entered into in 2010 with National Indemnity, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway.","As you may recall, CNA purchased $4 billion in reinsurance coverage from National Indemnity, in return for $2.2 billion of assets in a transaction referred to as a loss portfolio transfer.","Under the arcane rules of retroactive reinsurance accounting as CNA increased its reserves for asbestos and pollution above $2.2 billion, it is allowed to recognize only a portion of that reserve increase as a reinsurance benefit. CNA is required to record the balance as a period expense. Over the life of the contract, the net income impacted these reserve increases up to the $4 billion limit will net to zero. However, because of the requirements of retroactive reinsurance accounting for the life of the contract CNA will recognize gains in some years and losses in others.","Notably, these accounting entries will have no cash impact on CNA. More information on the charges available in the fourth quarter slide deck on the CNA Investor Relations website.","And secondly, at HighMount, as a result of continued softness in the price of natural gas liquids pricing together with negative reserve revisions, the company incurred $52 million after tax ceiling test impairment charge in the fourth quarter and $186 million for the full-year.","Additionally, as a result of continued low market prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids, the recent history of quarterly ceiling test impairment charges and negative reserve revisions, HighMount's goodwill impairment analysis determined a write-off of the remaining goodwill balance associated with the Loews acquisition of HighMount is required. The charge in the fourth quarter was $382 million after-tax.","For Loews book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income increased to $49.38 at December 31, 2013 from $47.94 at December 31, 2012.","CNA's contribution to Loews results for the fourth quarter was income of $199 million as compared to a net loss of $7 million last year. For the full-year of 2013, net income to Loews was $847 million as compared to $570 million for 2012. CNA's earnings increase primarily from improved non-catastrophe current actual year underwriting results, higher investment income and lower catastrophe losses. These increases were partially offset for the charge mentioned earlier, which impacted Loews' net income by $111 million after-tax and non-controlling interest.","For prior year was unfavorably affected by catastrophe losses of $170 million after-tax in non-controlling interest related to Storm Sandy.","Diamond offshore's contribution to Loews' results for the fourth quarter was income of $44 million as compared to $73 million last year. For the full-year 2013, net income attributed to Loews was $257 million as compared to $337 million to 2012.","For the fourth quarter and for the full-year the main factors behind the decrease in Diamond's earnings were lower rig utilization principally due to downtime for scheduled surveys and shipyard projects. And an income tax provision of $57 million or $27 million for Loews after non-controlling interest related to Egyptian operations. Also contributing to the decline was a gain in 2012 of $32 million after-tax and non-controlling interest from the sale of six jack-up rigs.","The decreases in 2013 were partially offset by higher day rates as well as the receipt by Diamond of $25 million from Niko Resources as part of the contract settlement related to the Ocean Monarch. Diamond has taken delivery of the Ocean Onyx, which has begun working for Apache and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, Diamond has taken delivery of the Ocean Black Hornet, the first of its four new build drill ships, which is headed for the U.S. Gulf where it will for work for Anadarko on a five-year contract.","Boardwalk pipeline's contribution to Loews' net results for the fourth quarter was $4 million as compared to $31 million last year. For the full-year 2013 net operating income attributable to Loews was $78 million as compared to $111 million for 2012. HighMount's results were significantly impacted by the ceiling test and goodwill impairment charges I already discussed. Excluding these charges, HighMount reported a loss of $19 million for the fourth quarter 2013 compared to income of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.","For the full-year 2013, HighMount posted a net loss of $5 million as compared to income of $26 million for 2012. HighMount's fourth quarter production volumes and realized prices which included the benefits of hedges are as follows. Natural gas production was 8 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $4.38 per 1000 cubic feet, natural gas liquids production was 496.2000 barrels at an average realized price of $36.10 per barrel and oil production was 133.3000 barrels at an average price of $92.97 per barrel. HighMount has hedges in place as of December 31, 2013; it covered approximately 59.9% and 20.9% of its total estimated 2014 and 2015 natural gas equivalent production at weighted average prices of $5.52 and $4.24 per Mcfe.","Loews Hotels and Resorts had a net loss of $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to a net loss of $2 million last year. For the full-year 2013, Loews Hotels had a net loss of $3 million as compared to net income of $7 million for 2012. Results was significantly impacted by the renovation of the Loews Regency Hotel in New York, which reopened in January 2014 after being closed for about a year as well as acquisitions and transition costs of newly acquired hotels.","Holding company cash and investments as of December 31, 2013, totaled $4.7 billion as compared to $4.8 billion for the period ended September 30, 2013. We received $189 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $736 million in dividends for the full-year. From CNA, Loews received $49 million of dividends in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $194 million in dividends for the year. From Diamonds, Loews received $62 million in dividends in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $245 million in dividends for the year. From Boardwalk, Loews received $78 million in dividends in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $297 million in dividends for the year.","We paid $24 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2013 and $97 million for the year. We did not buy back any shares in the fourth quarter. For the year, we brought back 4.9 million shares of Loews common stock for $218 million and that completes my remarks.","And I'll turn the call back over to Jim.","Jim Tisch","Thank you, Pete. Before we open up the call for questions, I wanted to add that Loews firmly believe in the benefits of portfolio diversification. At any given time our subsidiaries face different market environments, some challenging, others more hospitable. Today Boardwalk faces market headwinds that remains financially sound although Boardwalk's recent announcement may be disappointing we believe that the company's action will support long-term financial strength and future growth of the company and will benefit all of its shareholders including Loews in the long-term.","Now, I will turn the call back over to Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Jim. Jackie, at this time, we would like to open up the call for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions)","Our first question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Good morning, Jim.","Jim Tisch","Good morning, David.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","A couple of things I wanted to ask, Jim. First, is there any linkage whatsoever between what will obviously be a cash shortfall or a significant reduction in the cash flow that Loews will receive from Boardwalk at least in the coming year, with respect to both the action of CNA to pay a one-time special dividend and\/or the timing of that action?","Jim Tisch","Dave, believe it or not there absolutely was no connection between the two. CNA came to the realization on their loan that they had excess capital and wanted to pay a special dividend and so notified us the people of CNA did not know what was going on at Boardwalk, and likewise we did not tell them nor we prod them for special dividend which is purely coincidence.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then, Jim, as it relates to the magnitude of the reduction in the dividend at Boardwalk, what was the thinking to do something so dramatic as opposed to perhaps a more moderate increase, build up the \u2013 improve the capital structure there over time and not have such a dramatic, immediate effect?","Jim Tisch","Well, first of all, this dividend reduction is done from a position of strength. The reason that Boardwalk -- the Board of Boardwalk cut the dividend so dramatically is because they wanted to make sure that the company would have the capital that is needed to finance growth projects for Boardwalk as well as both having the ability to bring the debt to EBITDA levels down to the 4-to-1 range.","So it was really done from a position of strength, it was done with the thought in mind that they want to project the holders of Boardwalk from dilution that might occur from a reduction in \u2013 a modest reduction in the dividend whereby the company would have to continue to access the equity markets. And the Board decided that the best way to protect long-term investor value was to make this more draconian type so that the company would not have to access nearly as much of the capital markets.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","And when you look at over time, Jim, at the capital pipeline for Boardwalk, its investment opportunities including Bluegrass, do you feel as if Boardwalk will be able to fund its level of contribution to those development projects without incurring significant dilution, without having to issue a significant number of new units, and remotely close to the current unit price?","Jim Tisch","Yes. Boardwalk is going to save 100s of million of dollars otherwise would have been paid as dividend that now can be used to finance these capital projects. And as you firmly say before and I will say it again, I think there will be lots of opportunities for Boardwalk to invest at attractive rate. Yes. There is no doubt that the company is suffering from the effects of the Marcellus -- the increased Marcellus and Utica Shale production. But the other thing that's going on is that the amount of natural gas that's going to be produced in the United States is increasing and will increase dramatically. Natural gas produced in the United States now is about 66 billion cubic feet per day that in the next 10 years that could increase by one-third with the effect of increased gas consumption in the United States, as well as the export of natural gas. All that gas is going to have to move on pipelines from one place to another and that is going to mean that they will have to continue to be a very significant buildup of our natural gas pipeline system and Boardwalk is now very well-positioned to be able to participate in that and to benefit from it.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Two other things Jim, the issue that Boardwalk and HighMount, do they make Loews less inclined more inclined or there no change at all with respect to the appetite to do a \u2013 to buy a business outside of one of your core existing operations?","Jim Tisch","When we think about investments we think about buying outside of our business about repurchasing our shares and about investing in our subsidiaries. So yes, with respect to Boardwalk, we've said that we're willing to commit $300 million in subordinated debt and we will also on a case-by-case basis willing to help them out with large investments. When we think about -- so that will cause some \u2013 we will have reserve some of our cash for that and likewise if Boardwalk moves ahead with the Bluegrass project we'll have to reserve cash for that.","So remember, we are going to have more cash flow at Loews this year some of our subsidiaries assuming the current dividend rate compared to last year. So Loews will still have significant amount of cash flow and we're starting from the base of $4.7 billion. So to the extent that we should find an acquisition candidate that we think has zero long-term value creation possibility for us would be happy to move forward.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Then one last thing, if I could. It appears that in the discrete fourth quarter at HighMount there was an impairment charge not related to goodwill impairment am I correct? And what exactly was written down?","Pete Keegan","It was some equipment that can no longer be used.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Jim Tisch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Capital.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital","Good morning, Loews team.","Jim Tisch","Good morning, Bob.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital","A question on natural gas prices, when I look at the Henry Hub price that was up 25% in 2013 and another 39% year-to-date, how does that impact the reserve charges that you took; I mean if you had been using the $5.99 price, would there have been less of a write-down?","Jim Tisch","Pete, why don't you talk about the mechanics behind the reserve charge?","Pete Keegan","No. It really wouldn't have materially affected it. The way you do the ceiling test Bob is a four quarter historical rolling average. So any one quarter doesn't really change it that much so the ceiling test might have been minimally impacted but not much. The goodwill test is totally different test, it's a two step process, you either pass or fail step one, which is based on all kind of market metrics if you fail, which we did you then go to step two and its like redoing purchase price accounting, allocate between gas assets and whatever is left over is goodwill and we did that calculation. There was nothing left over for goodwill. And that was while it's related to pricing its not heavily related to current pricing.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital","If the Henry Hub price had been $5.99 for the trailing four quarters, would that have mattered?","Pete Keegan","Yes.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital","And if it stays at --","Pete Keegan","I don't know how much we have to go do the calculation, but yes.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital","And my assumption is, if it stays at $5.99, there is no sort of write-up?","Pete Keegan","There is no write-up. You just don't have another write-down potentially.","Jim Tisch","That's number one and number two, if it stayed at $.599 that would really be in defiance of the forward curve which shows natural gas moving back down towards fourth.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital","Right. What does where the forward curve imply to sort of the economics of the business today? Where does it have to go to, to be the economic -- to process the gas?","Jim Tisch","So as you look out at the United States there are different areas that have different costs -- different areas have different cost of producing natural gas different economics. So generally, we've assumed that after the Marcellus, the next area is going to come on with additional production would be a place like the Haynesville. And Sonora is behind Haynesville and the few other shales such that those other areas will probably have to come on first before it is economic for us to drill for natural gas in Sonora.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital","So what price would it have to be, I didn't quite that Jim?","Jim Tisch","A $1 probably north of $5.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital","So north of $5. What is your thought process in retaining this business unit? You still think there is long-term potential, I assume, or there is no market to sell? But what's the argument for keeping this --","Jim Tisch","The gas there that's in the ground that has not been drilled is not going to disappear and one day that could become economic to produce. Two things could happen, number one prices could increase and number two, there could be new technology that make it possible to drill that. Next as we said we are, there are different stratas within our field in Sonora that do hold large amount of oil and specifically I mentioned during my comments that we are drilling in the Wolfcamp within Sonora, we drilled a number of wells that we call our science experiment to see if we can figure out how to move to development drillings in a commercial manner. We are not there yet but over the next several quarters hopefully we'll have more to say about that.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital","Okay. Last series of questions. What was your pension gain from a book perspective in the fourth quarter? What do you think the EPS impact prospectively will be and what will the funding needs change prospectively?","Pete Keegan","Our qualified pension is pretty small, Bob. So while we did get a pick up and especially fully funded, we did get a pick up as a result of the change in the discount rate is virtually everybody did. The impact on expense is pretty minimal because our plant is fully funded there isn't much expense and it isn't going to move the needle very much.","Jim Tisch","Simple answer is for Loews, the parent company and does not necessarily include the --","Pete Keegan","Well, I'm sorry. I assumed that is what you asked, do you want more than that?","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital","Well, the CNA changes don't impact Loews.","Pete Keegan","Yes. Ultimately, you'll see it in the consolidated balance sheet. I mean, we still have work in process putting all that together you heard on their call that they had --","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital","So the $300 million would flow through that's essentially the nuts of how that flows through for you guys?","Peter Keegan","Yes. That will be reflected in the consolidated balance sheet.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital","Okay. Thank you.","Jim Tisch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Baker with Barclays.","Andy Baker - Barclays","Thank you. Good morning thanks for taking the call. Couple of questions on Boardwalk first of all. Can you discuss the sort of thought process on the timeframe of this cut, I mean it's a pretty dramatic cut I assume it's not intended to be resetting Boardwalk's distribution at a dramatically lower level just adjusting the current environment which they operate?","Jim Tisch","Repeat the question.","Andy Baker - Barclays","Just the timeframe you are thinking about these cuts. I assume these are not cuts intended to last resetting $0.010 as the ongoing distribution. I assume it's set to right size their leverage and then, ultimately, they will be moving back up.","Jim Tisch","Yes. I agree with you ultimately they're moving backup that's the decision for the Board of Boardwalk and I don't think that they're thinking right now about when dividend is going to move up they're going to, as any Board would do they're going to look each quarter at the financials of the company at the prospects at as a list of investments they have the market price for Boardwalk shares and will make their decision accordingly.","Andy Baker - Barclays","And the $300 million of subordinated debt, is that just to sort of meeting the needs for growth CapEx or can they also use that to, for them to pay down their senior debt?","Peter Keegan","Well, it's really targeted for growth projects but its cash, if the whole thing is funded so in period it could go to data and debt. But the process of thinking was it is project related.","Andy Baker - Barclays Capital","Okay. As we talked about the dividend policy of all of your subsidiaries today, it seems like an appropriate time to pick up the dividend policy of Loews again. Obviously as your cash now continues to grow up through the $4.7 billion and you haven't raised your dividend, I don't think, in about seven or eight years. Any thought process on if the current Loews parent quarterly distribution is at the appropriate level given your capitalization?","Jim Tisch","So Board discusses it from time-to-time and beyond that I really don't want to go any further on it.","Andy Baker - Barclays Capital","Fair enough. I guess last question, Jim. Any changes to where this $4.7 billion is invested and how you are looking at where the opportunities for returns are in the market?","Jim Tisch","No change at all. We continue to kick tires. We continue to assess the needs of our subsidiaries and also continue to assess possibility for share repurchase.","Andy Baker - Barclays Capital","But, I mean where it currently sits in terms of equities versus fixed income versus hedge funds?","Jim Tisch","I'm sorry. No significant change we have \u2013 I think about $700 million of hedge funds investments and another $400 million to $500 million of equity investments and then beyond that it's mostly in short-term investments that earn very, very little.","Andy Baker - Barclays Capital","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Sorry to make this so much about Boardwalk; obviously it's timely. I know that Andrew sits on the Board and I was wondering to the extent to which \u2013 that this was an obvious decision on the part or this was complicated. If Boardwalk is indeed in a state of financial strength right now, in terms of thinking about the timing and everything, to some extent was this \u2013 is this an obvious thing to do from the Board's perspective with all their information?","Jim Tisch","Josh, I think so. I can't speak for the Board because I wasn't at the meeting, but when they decided to do this, but I only support the decision. The Board had two different ways that they could go. They could stress and strain and continue to pay the dividend or pay a slightly reduced dividend knowing that they would have to then go into the ethylene market to raise capital in order to make investments in growth projects.","And I think what the Board saw is that there could be very, very significant dilution to the existing shareholders. So the Board decided instead to go to the route of significantly cutting the dividend so that the distribution. So that the company could make those accretive investments without any dilution to the unit holders. And I would say that the hope and expectation is that in the future the distribution will be able to be increased to levels that approached any historic levels that they have been at.","This was all based on the Board's view of the business outlook and the changes that take place within the natural gas pipeline business.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Understandable. And historically you guys have been patient and understandable owners of cyclical businesses and you understand the concept about buying low and selling high. Would you ever consider increasing your stake in one of your subsidiaries that you have already sold down a piece as prices weaken for that security?","Jim Tisch","Let me just say this. We never say never to anything. So we just look at what's going on. We assessed all portfolio. We assessed the prospects for the business. We assessed the other cause for our cash. There is an awful a lot that goes into the assessment. And like I said, we never say never.","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning.","Jim Tisch","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","I would like to shift the discussion, if we might, to Diamond, which we haven't talked about. Could you comment, since you do sit on that Board, Jim, and chair it, as to, one, the CEO search and when you expect to have an announcement; what you are looking for there?","And, two, with respect to that valuation, it would seem that there are many in the market who think the prospects have worsened dramatically in the last six weeks, wondering if you could comment on that. Then picking up on that last question, willingness, ability to buy more shares in Diamond, and\/or expectations of changes to dividend policy there with so much in the special? Thank you.","Jim Tisch","Like I said, first item is the CEO search and I would say that we have \u2013 the Board of Diamond has not asleep at the switch. They been moving with, I will say great dispatch in the search for a CEO and we are hopeful that there can be an announcement from Diamond in the near future on that score.","With respect to the offshore, the rate for rigs in the offshore drilling market, I truly don't know which way day rates are going to go, it's a very complicated mosaic where you have got oil companies that contract with us that feel pressure on their cash flow in their capital investment. They also feel pressure to increased oil and gas production, the new rigs coming into the market. There is an awful lot going on.","The thing that I know is that means for Diamond is that there could be a lots and lots of opportunities. There could be opportunities to buy rates in the market because Diamond is the financially the strongest competitor in the industry. So some competitors that are highly levered. There are some that, to us seem to have really extended themselves in terms of their capital commitments. So there could be lots of opportunities to create a long-term value. And what Diamond does is that they watch carefully what's going on around them and they like Loews, look to build long-term value in whichever way they can. And they are willing to use their balance sheet in order to do that.","Unidentified Analyst","Again, picking up on what I was trying to ask, is, as to their valuation and balance sheet, it would seem that the capital there is spoken for with the CapEx commitments previously made that you are still paying for this year and some into 2015. And with that the special dividend appears to be funded, but what about the opportunity to buy back stock? Is that something that you would encourage them to do, or would that make more sense, if Loews saw value, to do at the parent company, i.e., take your stake up above 51%?","Jim Tisch","So Diamond goes first. And I leave it to the Board to decide specifically what they want to do with the expected share repurchases?","Unidentified Analyst","And so if they decided not to against the prior gentleman's question just from a portfolio management, if you wanted to, are there any constraints and you buying more shares of Diamond here, you think it's undervalued?","Jim Tisch","Are there constraints? No. But like I said, there are lots of things that we take into consideration when thinking about share repurchases and other investments by Loews.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. I will leave it there. Thank you.","Jim Tisch","Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research.","Michael Millman - Millman Research","Thank you. Following up on the last one and a couple of other things. For those -- on Diamond, particularly for those who are not that close, when I look at some of the numbers the stock is at a 52-week low, yet the Street almost unanimously seems to think that earnings in 2015 will be substantially higher. So a question, does that seem reasonable to you?","Then on CNA, could you just repeat what last year's dividends were? And on Boardwalk, current price, does that suggest that you may have to take any write-downs?","Jim Tisch","So on Boardwalk, no Loews doesn't have to take any write-downs. And CNA, the dividend last year was at $0.20 per quarter rate and the year before that was in $0.15 per quarter rate. And what was the question about Diamond again?","Michael Millman - Millman Research","Well, on the CNA also what was the \u2013 you expect $500 million this year, what did you get last year? On the Diamond is that the \u2013 it's a 52-week low despite the Street seemingly agreeing that earnings would be substantially up in 2015. I was wondering if we were missing -- if those of us who are not that close are missing something \u2013 a lot.","Jim Tisch","I can't speak for why Diamond is, price where it is. You have to ask some analysts on Wall Street. From my perspective, it seems like a crazy valuation that who am I to say.","Diamond is a \u2013 as I said has the strongest balance sheet in the industry. It has a phenomenal record of investment in offshore drilling rigs, rather than build new rigs. We completed refurbished all of it. And we have the equivalent of brand new rig that have the size that are able to earn just about where the new rig out of a shipyard cost. We got four new rigs coming out of the shipyard now.","The market or the analysts seem to be focused on the age of the Diamond fleet, but my life the Diamond fleet does not nearly have the age that the analysts calculate. When I look at the age of our design win fleet, I think in terms of the market valuated age so that when you multiply the age by the market value of the rig and then conclude the average age for the fleet. Our number show that our fleet is about the same age of the Transocean fleet.","So I think Diamond is tremendously strong, has lots of financial flexibility and I don't really understand what the market is focused on.","Michael Millman - Millman Research","Okay. And just on the CNA, what was \u2013 ","Peter Keegan","Jim your question relates to, how much did we receive in distributions in 2013?","Michael Millman - Millman Research","Right.","Peter Keegan","Loews received $194 million.","Michael Millman - Millman Research","Okay. And $500 million this year?","Jim Tisch","Just under \u2013 it will be \u2013 at the current dividend rate \u2013 just under $500 million.","Peter Keegan","All right. Let me answer that question mechanically. If you subtract the special dividend, which they declared of a dollar and you then take the quarterly distributions and multiply them by four, you will end up with a number that is somewhat under $500 million. But, that is \u2013 the Boards obviously have declared nothing beyond the first quarter distribution level.","Jim Tisch","You add those not subtract them.","Peter Keegan","Add them, sorry. Well, to get to the number you got to subtract it and then add it back. You can't multiply the first quarter by fourth.","Jim Tisch","Thanks. Okay.","Michael Millman - Millman Research","Thank you.","Operator","That was our final question.

Tisch - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Mary, and good morning. We're going to change the format of this call slightly today just to mix things up a bit. Our CFO, David Edelson, will start by walking you through Loews' second quarter results, and then I'll talk about our view of the medium-term to long-term prospects for each of our businesses.","Okay, David, over to you.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Loews reported a net loss of $65 million or $0.19 per share in Q2 2016 as opposed to net income of $170 million or $0.46 per share in last year's second quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated net income of $37 million or $0.11 per share.","Our second quarter earnings were dominated by asset impairments at Diamond Offshore, which overwhelmed favorable results posted by CNA Financial and Boardwalk Pipeline, as well as good returns generated by our parent company investment portfolio. The impairments at Diamond, which totaled $678 million pre-tax on its books reduced our net income by $267 million.","Before I drill into Diamond's results, let me summarize the year-over-year quarterly net income contribution by each of our subsidiaries and by the parent company investment portfolio. Two of our subsidiaries, CNA and Boardwalk, posted significant increases in net income contribution over the prior year. CNA contributed $189 million including realized gains up 52% from last year and Boardwalk's contribution rose from $12 million last year to $17 million this year.","In addition, the parent company investment portfolio generated $56 million of after tax income this year, a big swing from the last quarter's $8 million loss and the $7 million gain in Q2 2015. Our remaining two subsidiaries, Diamond and Loews Hotels, posted year-over-year declines in each case driven by unusual items. Diamond contributed a $290 million net loss in Q2 2016 versus net income of $45 million last year and Loews Hotels essentially broke even this quarter, down from net income of $8 million in the prior year. Loews Hotels' results this quarter were significantly affected by the write-down of an equity investment in a joint venture hotel property. But clearly, Diamond drove our disappointing second quarter results, so let me start by explaining Diamond's second quarter.","The offshore drilling market continues to be extremely challenged with limited new drilling opportunities and an oversupply of rigs. In addition, customers are choosing not to extend current contracts and in some cases, seeking ways to early terminate existing contracts.","Diamond assessed its rig fleet for impairment at the end of the quarter and in light of the difficult market environment and Diamond management's evolving view of the length and severity of the downturn, eight rigs have been written down to substantially lower net book values. These rigs are a mix of third generation, fourth generation and fifth generation semi-submersibles. Four of the eight rigs being impaired are stacked, two are still on contract and two are being scrapped.","There are four key drivers of the write-downs on the six rigs not being scrapped. Number one, longer lapse time until the rigs are projected to return to work. Number two, higher cost to reactivate the stacked rigs and ready them to return to work. Number three, lower expected future day rates once the rigs return to work. And finally, lower assumed utilization once the rigs return to work. Absent its asset impairments, Diamond's operating income was relatively weak during the quarter. The combination of fewer rigs on contract and an unexpectedly high amount of unscheduled downtime on its new build drillships led to a 42% decline in contract drilling revenues versus the second quarter of 2015. Diamond's net income in Q2 was further reduced by a valuation allowance for current and prior year tax assets associated with foreign tax credits as Diamond no longer expects to be able to utilize these tax credits to offset income taxes in the U.S.","Jim will provide further thoughts on Diamond's prospects shortly. I would just emphasize that Diamond remains financially strong and is well-positioned from a capital and liquidity standpoint to weather today's storms, continue as a leader in the offshore drilling space, and seek to turn adversity into opportunity.","Turning to CNA, in the second quarter, CNA contributed a $189 million to our net income, which includes $6 million of realized investment gains. This compares to a net income contribution of $124 million in the second quarter of 2015. This substantial increase was primarily driven by three items. Number one, higher favorable prior development this year, emanating from all three P&C businesses: specialty, commercial and international. Number two, the absence in this year's second quarter of a retroactive reinsurance charge, associated with a Loss Portfolio Transfer of CNA's asbestos and environmental liabilities with National Indemnity. And three, improved results in the Life & Group segment, reflective of the Q4 2015 reserve unlocking that reset the underlying actuarial assumptions on the long-term care reserves.","CNA's core P&C business posted net operating income for the quarter, down slightly from the prior year, despite a solid one point improvement in the calendar year combined ratio. From an underwriting standpoint, the impact of higher favorable prior development was offset by an increase in CNA international's accident year combined ratio. This increase was driven by higher catastrophe losses as well as lower accident year of non-cat underwriting profit attributable mostly to large loss activity.","Additionally, P&C's net operating income during Q2 2016 was negatively affected by currency exchange rates. Last year, retroactive reinsurance charge reduced CNA's contribution to our second quarter net income by $49 million. There was no such charge in this year's second quarter as CNA completed its asbestos and environmental reserve reviews this year in the first quarter.","During the second quarter, CNA's Life & Group segment which houses the long-term care business produced a $4 million net operating loss, compared with a $24 million operating loss in the second quarter of last year. This slight loss was essentially in line with expectations, following the unlocking of the company's long-term care active life reserves at year-end 2015.","As a reminder, the financial results for CNA's long-term care business, reflect a variance between actual experience and management's best estimate actuarial assumptions. On a year-to-date basis, the Life & Group segment has posted a $6 million net operating loss versus a loss of $41 million in the first half of 2015.","On to Boardwalk, Boardwalk posted a strong second quarter as net revenues were up 8% year-over-year, just as they were in Q1. EBITDA was up 14% and net income was up 63%. Boardwalk's contribution to our net income increased from $12 million last year to $17 million this year, driven by the strong underlying operating results. A reconciliation of Boardwalk's EBITDA to its net income can be found in its Q2 earnings release. The main drivers of Boardwalk's strong revenue quarter were the return to service of the Evangeline ethylene pipeline in mid-2015, recently completed growth projects placed into service over the last year, and improved revenues from parking and lending and storage.","This year's second quarter revenues were favorably impacted by a $13 million legal settlement, whereas last year's second quarter benefited from the receipt of $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds. I wanted to highlight two developments with respect to Boardwalk's funding profile. First, Loews agreed to extend the borrowing period under our $300 million subordinated loan agreement by two years from December 2016 to December 2018. All other terms remain the same. Boardwalk has yet to utilize this facility.","And second, Boardwalk exercised a one-year extension option on its credit facility, extending the maturity date for May 2020 to May 2021, although one bank participated in the extension, resulting in $1.475 billion being extended to May 2021. Currently, Boardwalk is not drawn on its credit facility.","Now for a quick review of Loews Hotels, which contributed pre-tax income of $4 million, down from $14 million in the second quarter of 2015. The company's operational strides were masked by the write-down of an equity investment in one of its joint venture hotel properties. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes this write-down increased over the prior quarter. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income can be found in the Loews quarterly snapshot on loews.com. Please note that we expect the hotel company's second half results to be somewhat muted by recently commenced renovations at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel.","Let me turn to the parent company. In the second quarter, the parent company investment portfolio generated after-tax income of $56 million compared with income of $7 million in the prior year quarter. Equities, including gold-related equity investments accounted for the bulk of the income in the year-over-year increase. We ended the quarter with parent company cash and investments of $4.9 billion and debt of $1.8 billion.","During the quarter, we received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $61 million from CNA and $13 million more Boardwalk. Year-to-date, we have received total dividends of $632 million combined from CNA and Boardwalk. Our share repurchase activity since last quarter has been modest. We repurchased 1.9 million shares from April 1 through the end of July spending $76 million. Year-to-date, we have spent just under a $109 million repurchasing 2.8 million shares.","Average shares outstanding were 339 million in the second quarter, down 8.5% from 370 million in Q2, 2015.","And now, I will hand the call back to Jim.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Thank you, David. I'd like to talk about the medium-term to long-term prospects of each of our subsidiaries. Actually, I think it's much \u2013 a much more fitting conversation for us to have since at Loews quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of the long-term performance and ultimate value of our businesses.","While we take notice of the near-term developments, we rarely measure the significance of an event or the returns on an investment over the short-term. As always, we are focused on a long-term value we can deliver to shareholders.","First, let's turn to Diamond Offshore. I want to start out by addressing the proverbial elephant in the room. Diamond's results this quarter were severely impacted by the rig impairment charges David mentioned earlier in the call. Keep in mind that the severe downturn in the offshore drilling market, combined with the difficulty in predicting the timing and degree of this inevitable recovery precipitated these impairments. It's important to note however, that Diamond is scrapping only two of the eight rigs being impaired today. Having been in the offshore drilling business for nearly 30 years and the supertanker business for seven years prior to that, I've seen cyclical downturns before. I'm hopeful that in this case, and similar to prior cases, the rigs being stacked today will work again and earn an attractive rate of return in the future.","Holding on to and ultimately reactivating capable older rigs is a strategy that Diamond has employed historically to create value and to differentiate itself from its competitors. There is no doubt that an oversupply of sixth-generation drillships currently exists. However, I believe that the older semisubmersibles being stacked today may indeed find work as the market recovers on jobs for which these third-generation, fourth-generation and fifth-generation rigs are better suited.","Diamond's innovative strategies, along with its financial strength and conservative capital management should enable the company to emerge from this turbulent market cycle stronger than any of its competitors. As I've said before, if there is a silver lining to this oil price downturn, it's that the lack of drilling activity today will only help speed the recovery of oil prices tomorrow. The effects of the current underinvestment in oil drilling are already starting to be evident, and will play out in the coming years. Demand for oil is still growing and remains quite healthy. With all its new rigs contracted at least through 2019, I'm confident in Diamond's medium-term to long-term prospects. While today the situation may seem bleak, we've seen this movie's prequel before and remember well how it ended.","Now, let's turn to our other energy subsidiary, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners. When discussing the future prospects of the pipeline space, I hear a lot about the challenges the industry faces, commodity pricing exposure, re-contracting issues, ballooning Marcellus production and slowing gas demand growth. While all of these factors are important, we believe that demand for U.S. natural gas will once again reaccelerate, both domestically and internationally.","As we know, exports of natural gas are increasing and the U.S. has the capability to produce an enormous amount of low cost natural gas. As of today, there are commitments to build LNG export plants with capacity of 8.5 billion cubic feet per day. The majority of these plants are located on the Gulf Coast and are scheduled to come online before 2020. Pipeline exports to Mexico are also increasing. Last year, these exports grew by nearly 1 billion cubic feet per day, which represents 1.5% of U.S. supply. Those exports are on track for a similar increase this year.","Additionally, industrial demand for natural gas and liquids is growing spurred by petrochemical production. This growth is a boon for Boardwalk, which provides services to the Gulf Coast petrochemicals industry and has key assets located in Louisiana's industrial hub.","Boardwalk is capitalizing on these trends with several natural gas and liquids projects already underway, all of which are on schedule and on budget. As these projects come into service over the next several years, they will also help offset possible revenue declines from renewals of certain legacy contracts and contribute to Boardwalk's cash generation.","Turning to the insurance market in CAN, you're familiar with some of the challenges facing this sector, including industry consolidation, a slow growth global economy, persistently low interest rates and decelerating premium rates. While not immune from these challenges, CNA has continued to make progress on its major strategic effort to become a top quartile underwriter. CNA is also aided by the fact that it's operating at a time when the insurance industry's capital management is extremely disciplined. Over the last few earnings calls, I've spent time explaining why I strongly believe that CNA can compete effectively in this environment, while also delivering strong operating profits.","Just to review, CNA has a strong foundation built on financial strength, outstanding human capital that is continually improving, a strong branch network and rigorous underwriting disciplines that have resulted in improved risk selection. So while the insurance industry may face some headwinds, CNA has never been stronger with regard to its capital, its brand and its competitive position.","And last but not least, let's take a look at Loews Hotels. The hotel industry continues to enjoy favorable market fundamentals albeit at a slowing pace. For the last six years, hotel room demand has outstripped supply and while both continue to grow, supply has been catching up. The increasing supply of rooms does create a more competitive environment, but there's still plenty of growth to be had. Another industry dynamic is the trend towards consolidation of major hotel companies. We believe that this trend can be a good thing for smaller and more nimble companies such of Loews Hotels.","After all, it's much easier for our chain of 25 properties to roll out and deliver innovative new services and offers for our guests. Loews Hotels will remain focused on opportunistically growing the chain in key markets. The focus of our growth will be on the group hotels, our sweet spot, as well as resort destinations such as Orlando.","Just two weeks ago, Loews opened its fifth hotel in Orlando, the 1,000 room Sapphire Falls Hotel bringing our key count there to sub 5,200. The grand opening of this new property is just the latest development in what has been an exceptionally successful partnership with Universal Orlando Resorts.","Before we proceed to our Q&A, let me review why I'm confident about the medium-term to long-term prospects of each of our businesses. CNA has improved its underwriting performance and paid significant dividends to shareholders while maintaining its strong capital position. Diamond is currently in a very tough market, and although we can't predict when the market will turn, Diamond is weathering the storm well. It's been conserving its financial resources and maintaining its position as the strongest offshore drilling company in terms of credit rating, finance, innovation and leadership.","Boardwalk has made smart capital decision that should allow it to fund its announced growth projects and to contribute to its cash flow once these projects come online. And Loews Hotels continues to grow its chain steadily with an eye towards increased profitability and cash flow. As for Loews Corporation, we have always maintained a fortress balance sheet. Our parent company cash and investments exceed our debt just as they have for the vast majority of the last four decades. Despite the current turbulence in the energy sector, our financial position remains ironclad and allows us to take advantage of opportunities as they arrive. Whatever the environment Loews and its subsidiaries are operating in, our strategic imperative remains the same, creating value for shareholders over the long-term.","And now, I'd like to turn the call back to Mary Skafidas.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Jim. Kristal, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Good morning.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, I want to throw a bunch of things out there and have you sort of explained to me relative valuations for various things. Back about a year ago when oil was priced at around, I think, $35 a barrel and Diamond's stock was trading below $30 you bought back some stock, I am sure with an eye on where you thought two-year oil was going to be. About a quarter ago, with CNA stock dropping below $30, and trying to, I guess, capture what you expect to be about a 10% dividend yield, you bought back stock. So, both Diamond and CNA might be attractive to you \u2013 not as attractive, but can we talk about the price of oil, the price of a 10% dividend yield and your willingness to buy back subsidiary stock as opposed to your own?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Okay. Let's start with Diamond. When we bought back the shares of Diamond, I think that, we did not anticipate that the decline in offshore drilling would be as bad as it has been. We didn't anticipate that oil prices would go into the $20s, we didn't anticipate that oil companies would cut back their capital budget so dramatically. And we certainly didn't anticipate that utilization today of drilling rigs would be at the levels that they're at. So, I think we were surprised and I daresay that the rest of the market was surprised by what's happened in the offshore drilling industry. But now, I think, we recognized very clearly exactly where we are in that business.","With respect to CNA, I would say it's just the opposite of Diamond. Things have worked out pretty much as we have expected. CNA continues to improve on its underwriting, its earnings have come in very strong and when we bought CNA's stock in the $20s we said then and we say now the stock is just too damn cheap. You're right, when we bought it, it did represent a 10% yield when you look at \u2013 look in the rearview mirror and take into account the special dividend along with the regular dividend. And we believe very much in the strength of CNA's business. As I said in my remarks, we believe strongly in the capital level that CNA has and we believe strongly in the improvements that are taking place at CNA.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And so \u2013 and versus Loews' stock \u2013 the return on Loews' stock, I guess.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So when I think about what I do, the primary \u2013 I think my primary job is that of capital allocator. We allocate capital to Loews share repurchases to purchases of subsidiary shares. We allocate capital from time-to-time to our subsidiaries to the extent that they might need capital from Loews and it represents a good return to Loews. And then, we also allocate capital to \u2013 less often, but in bigger amounts to repurchase \u2013 to purchase, sorry, new businesses. So, these are just the types of capital allocation issues that we have the competition for our capital. And from my perspective and the Loews Corporation perspective, we are constantly making judgments every day, what is the best place for our capital, and the times when we bought CNA shares and the times when we bought Diamond shares, at those points in time, without the benefit of rearview mirror today, we decided to purchase those shares.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And just backtracking, do you have a view on two-year oil?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","I like it a lot. I think the \u2013 as I said in my remarks, I think oil companies in the world in general are dramatically under-investing in oil production capacity, I think that \u2013 I think, I believe, I know that depletion is real that oil wells do not continue producing forever, some of them decline at 70% a year, some of them decline at 5% a year, but all of them decline. And to the extent that the world is not reinvesting in new productive capacity, those declines in production will be felt in the coming years. Combined with that even though some say that oil demand growth is sluggish, oil demand is still continuing to increase every year generally on the order by about 1 million barrels a day or about 1%. So, as you add a few years together of underinvestment, combined with continued demand growth, I think you can see that in a few years time, prices will have to go up in order to provide the investment returns needed by oil companies in order to make the investment in more productive capacity. And I think that in two years' time, that will certainly happen. I recall \u2013 I \u2013 in prior calls, I've said that $65 was my fearless forecast, for year-end 2018 oil, I think there is a good chance that oil will be significantly higher than that on the order of, say, $10 a barrel.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And in terms of the, I guess, cash flows to Loews Corp right now, as you look at your appetite for deploying dividends, repurchases and other opportunities, is there a corporate outlook about how much cash flow you expect your businesses to generate to you in the next 12 months?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Yes. Yeah, yeah. We think about that all the time. We don't...","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And the CNA dividend coming, I guess, do you consider the special part of the dividend part of that capital management or that cash flow forecast?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","We take all the sources of capital that we anticipate coming into Loews into account. The thing that Loews doesn't do nor do our subsidiaries do is make forward-looking statements as to what specifically those amounts are.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for answering all the questions and good luck with the remainder of the year.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel, Janney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning, Loews.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Good morning.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","The parent investment income was relatively robust, relative to recent run rates in a period where the stock market was not that robust. What was the source of the $56 million?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","As I say, you die by the sword, you live by the sword. We had for a number of quarters, even years, suffered with gold investments. And what's happened in this most recent quarter is that our gold investments came to life. And the investment income in the quarter is primarily attributable to our gold investments.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","How big a commitment do you have to gold?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","It is surprisingly small. It's about $150 million maybe, this is not \u2013 it's not so big. We've had on our gold investments, this quarter, this year-to-date, more than a 100% rate of return, not annualized, just in the six months 100% rate of \u2013 greater than a 100% rate of return on those gold investments.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. Second question is \u2013 you said you are going to have a drag on hotels in the second half because of \u2013 was it Miami investments? What's the order of magnitude of that drag or investment spending?","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Well, this is David. Miami is undergoing a renovation and occupancy, RevPAR will be way down during that period of time. So we don't break out the earnings of Miami, or any of our individual properties. So suffice it to say though that Miami is quite a profitable property and the lack of profitability from that will be a drag on earnings.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","I'd say differently....","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Was it $3 million to $5 million or much bigger than that?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","We're not going to give a range, but let me just say...","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Miami is a significant contributor to Loews Hotels' income, and its earnings during this capital improvement time will be dramatically affected by the work that's being done. But we strongly believe that the hotel that will be seen by the public, when the work is completed will be a dramatic improvement over an already very profitable hotel.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. How long is the renovation period again?","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","(34:08) it's planned to be concluded at the end of November, the first part of December.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. And last question, Jim, over the last several years your economic view of like 2% GDP growth has proven to be a very valid forecast. We are limping along a little bit below that. Any concerns about the near-term economic outlook? Are you revising sort of your consistent?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","I'm staying with my forecast and when you said growth has been a bit below it, below my 2% mark, I'm reminded of what Larry Lindsey said to me and he may have been quoting some other economists, but he said that economists use decimal points to show the world that they have a sense of humor. So...","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","I get that.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","...I'm going to stick with my 2% growth forecast.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","There is nothing as far as the election or Brexit or the macro stuff that has happened that makes you pause on that forecast?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","My forecast \u2013 my forecast takes all of that and more into account.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Great. Okay, that makes me feel a little bit better. Thank you.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","My pleasure.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Thank you. So given that you see and that maybe the industry sees some improvement in oil prices the next couple years, that would suggest that there is no rush to dump rigs, I guess, like the Yankees selling. Where does that leave Diamond's strategy?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So, Diamond is scrapping two rigs, but we believe that even in a robust recovery that there won't be work for those two rigs. Those rigs are generally very old and have served their useful productive lives, but we do have a number of rigs that are stacked, that will be able to come out of stack mode and operate when, as and if, the oil \u2013 offshore oil drilling industry improves.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","I guess maybe I didn't ask my question well. In the past, you have indicated that a big turning point is when the industry gets so discouraged or out of money that they are dumping rigs as an opportunity to pick them up. Do you see that occurring in this cycle of two years, five years, whatever it may be?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So the primary market for third-generation, fourth-generation and fifth-generation rigs, I believe, will be in the shallower water depths where sixth-generation dynamically positioned rigs cannot compete. They just technically cannot compete there. So I think that there will be in the future, a good market for those third-generation, fourth-generation and fifth-generation rigs, but it will be a relatively small market, certainly not as big as it was in prior decades. So we are very comfortable \u2013 Diamond is very comfortable with the exposure that it has to that class of rigs.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","So, do you see \u2013 maybe I am not understanding your answer. Do you see a dumping, so as to speak, of rigs by the industry creating good opportunity \u2013 better opportunities for pricing rigs?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Yeah. So, I don't foresee Diamond purchasing any third-generation, fourth-generation and fifth-generation rigs. When you look at the economics of purchasing a third-generation, fourth-generation and fifth-generation rig, what you quickly realize is that the purchase price of the rig is really incidental and very small in comparison to the cost of re-commissioning the rig and going through a special survey. So the \u2013 in my opinion, the cycle is different, slightly different this time than last time, because in the cycle, say, in the late 1980s, early 1990s, you were able to buy rigs, re-commission them for very little and bingo, you would be back in business. This time, the cost to re-commission the rig after it's been in stacked mode for a few years can, in some instances, be measured \u2013 can be greater than a $100 million.","So it doesn't \u2013 the economics aren't \u2013 are not driven by whether you pay $5 million for the rig or $7 million for the rig. We feel that we have enough of that class of rigs that when and if the industry comes back, we will make a lot of money from those rigs, and we would anticipate making money then from sixth-generation and later rigs if the market truly improves.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","I see. Okay. Slightly different on the gold. With a 2% forecast for economic growth, that would not suggest a lot of inflation, which would seem to argue against gold investments.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So, I don't want to argue the merits of gold, I would just say that, for us gold has, and our portfolio has been a very good hedge that when stocks are down, gold tends to outperform and when stocks are in \u2013 are up, gold tends to underperform. And so, it's been, I think, a very good balance for our portfolio. I am not, nor is anybody else here at Loews what you would call a gold bug, but it was \u2013 it is interesting to me that in the first half of this year, we have a relatively modest investment in gold securities we've been able to earn an outsized rate of return on that investment.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Okay.

Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward-looking in nature.

Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.","This disclaimer is only a brief summary of the company's statutory forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included in the company's filings with the SEC.

Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mary. Good morning and thank you for joining us on our call today. Since I'm not in the habit of ignoring the elephant in the room, I want to start today's discussion by focusing on the stock prices of Loews and our subsidiaries.","You certainly don't need me to tell you that the stock market performed terribly in the third quarter. Unfortunately, the stocks of our subsidiaries performed even worse. The S&P 500 was down about 7% in the third quarter, the Diamond was down more than 30%, Boardwalk was down 19%, and CNA was down 9%.","Loews' share price was of course affected by these declines and performed on par with the S&P 500 for the quarter. In general, we believe that the stock market is undervaluing our shares and those of our subsidiaries. Despite being frustrated, rather than complain, we look at this as an opportunity to create value for Loews' shareholders by buying back our stock,, and we did.","Our lemonade from lemons attitude will not come as a shock to those of you who know us. We were happy to buy back 8.7 million shares of Loews' stock in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we've spent over $750 million buying back more than 19.6 million shares.","You might be asking yourself, why didn't we purchase more of our subsidiary shares directly? It's simple. As I mentioned, we believe that all of our subsidiaries' shares are currently undervalued in the market. When we purchased the Loews' shares, we were simultaneously buying all of our subsidiary shares at a conglomerate discount. So we focused the lion's share of our buybacks on Loews' stock to get what amounts to a double discount.","Let me spend a few moments on what might be driving the decline in our subsidiary shares. For our energy subsidiaries, the drop in their share prices is a function of the headwinds facing their respective markets. Diamond's share price has moved in line its peer group. The entire offshore drilling industry had a miserable year in the stock market and the misery is ongoing.","Unfortunately, the current fundamentals of the offshore drilling industry are lousy as well. Offshore drilling rig day rates have been driven down due to a trifecta of challenging market conditions, namely: one, the steep drop in oil prices; two, the reduction in oil companies' exploration and production budgets; and three, a wave of new rig deliveries that began about six years ago. These conditions have caused drilling contracts to be shortened, canceled or renegotiated, resulting in rigs being idled.","Additionally, oil companies have deferred or cancelled new drilling projects. Even with day rates currently at less than half of their peak levels, oftentimes there are still no takers for the rigs. These circumstances have created a difficult backdrop for the offshore drilling industry, to say the least.","Not to be lost in all of this, and despite the doom and gloom, Diamond did perform well this quarter, reporting strong earnings from their new drill ships with very little downtime and good cost management.","Since the start of this down-cycle, I've been asked, is offshore drilling coming back? My answer is an unequivocal yes. By some estimates, offshore oil production supplies up to 30% of the world's oil. This is a significant percentage that cannot be replaced by conventional onshore drilling or shale production. I believe that the lack of drilling now will sow the seeds for an oil price recovery later. When prices rise, which they will, Diamond's customers will return to exploring for new sources of production.","And while Diamond is mostly being affected by the cyclical downturn in the offshore drilling market, with its conservative capitalization, strong liquidity position and the added bonus that all of its six generation rigs are contracted, I'm confident that the company will be able to weather this cycle and emerge well-positioned for the rebound.","Turning to Boardwalk, their stock was down, but somewhat less than the Alerian Index, which is a composite of energy infrastructure Master Limited Partnerships. The Index took a 25% nosedive in the third quarter as investors became concerned about ML distribution growth rates, or, as I like to call it, the MLP treadmill. This is the very same treadmill that Boardwalk stepped off of about a year ago, allowing its management team to focus on positioning the company for long-term growth and profitability.","This longer horizon strategy has allowed Boardwalk to take advantage of the changing supply and demand dynamics in the natural gas market, by connecting its network of natural gas pipeline and storage assets to new end-use markets without the dilutive effects of significant share issuance at low prices. Boardwalk's focus has been on developing organic growth projects backed by long-term contracts. These projects promise to be great investments and are expected to provide Boardwalk with an unlevered double-digit rate of return on assets as they are completed over the next two years to four years. Even though the industry is in transition and the stock price is low, we're bullish about Boardwalk's long-term prospects.","Finally, let's take a look at CNA. The company's stock is down a bit more than the 6% decline of its peer group. CNA had a solid third quarter. And to my mind, there does not seem to be a correlation between stock price and performance here. CNA's strategy continues to be to deliver improved underwriting margins and its commercial business is the strongest it's been in years. While positive developments in the core P&C business were offset somewhat by reduced performance in the limited partnership portfolio, the underlying business is very strong.","Before I turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson, I want to reiterate why we remain positive on the long-term prospects of each of our subsidiaries. CNA is stronger than it's ever been. Its specialty business has always been a top performer and is the envy of the insurance industry, while its commercial business has shown tremendous improvement and there is still room for more.","As for Diamond Offshore, to say that it's operating in a very tough environment is an understatement. However, we've seen this movie before and we know how it ends. That's why Diamond has maintained a strong balance sheet and worked hard to secure long-term contracts for its newbuild rigs. There is no doubt that the company will weather the storm and hopefully growing the process.","Boardwalk has been able to capitalize on the changing supply and demand dynamics of the natural gas industry. The company is developing significant organic growth projects with outstanding rates of returns that will be coming online in the next several years.","And finally, Loews Hotels and Resorts has successfully focused on profitable growth and operational excellence. From 2012 through 2015, the hotel chain added eight hotels across the country. These additions have contributed positively to adjusted EBITDA. It's a trend that we hope to see continue.","At Loews, our actions are guided by our responsibility to our shareholders and our focus on creating long-term value. The strategies employed and steps taken by each of our subsidiaries have the same motivations and goals. So while our stock and those of our subsidiaries maybe out of favor among some, you won't find us complaining. Rather, you're more likely to find us repurchasing Loews' stock and creating value for all of our shareholders.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to David.","David B. Edelson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In this year's third quarter Loews reported income from continuing operations of $182 million or $0.50, up slightly from $179 million or $0.47 per share in the third quarter of 2014. The favorable year-over-year variance stem from higher quarterly net income at Diamond and Boardwalk, as well as higher net operating income at CNA. Offsetting these positive factors were realized investment losses at CNA versus realized gains in the prior-year.","On a net income basis, this year's third quarter was down from last year as last year's third quarter contained a gain from discontinued operations to reduce the previously-recognized impairment charge from the sale of HighMount. For the nine months ended September 30, income from continuing operations was $461 million or a $1.25 per share, down from $747 million or $1.94 per share in the prior year. Diamond and CNA drove the decrease along with lower parent company investment income.","Diamond booked rig impairments in both years with significantly larger impairments in 2015 than in 2014. Additionally, Diamond's rig operating income declined in 2015 because of reduced rig utilization, especially for the mid-water fleet, along with higher depreciation and interest expense.","Numerous offsetting items impacted CNA's year-over-year, year-to-date comparison including lower LP income in 2015, a retroactive reinsurance charge in 2015, but not in 2014, higher favorable net prior development in 2015 than in 2014, and several other items. The net of all these was a year-over-year income decline. Year-to-date, net income was up 20%. Last year's results included a $364 million after tax loss from discontinued operations attributable to the HighMount disposition and CNA sale of its Life business.","We ended this past quarter with book value per share of $52.52, total shareholders' equity of $18.7 billion, and parent company cash and investments of $4.8 billion against debt of $1.7 billion. Let me now delve more deeply into our quarterly earnings.","CNA contributed $190 million to our third quarter income before realized investment results, up from $164 million last year. Note that last year's third quarter included a $31 million hit to CNA's earnings contribution associated with the sale of its Life business.","CNA benefited in Q3 from improved accident year underwriting results and higher net favorable prior year development. The company's combined ratio before catastrophes and development in its core P&C business improved almost one point to 95.5%. Favorable prior year development lowered the calendar year combined ratio to 85.7%, a 10.4 point improvement from last year's third quarter. It's encouraging to see CNA continuing its year-over-year improvement in underwriting margin.","On a year-to-date basis, CNA posted a 94.3% calendar year combined ratio. Excluding development and catastrophe losses, the ratio was slightly higher at 95.9%. Again, both of these represented real improvement from the prior year.","The strong increase in CNA's P&C underwriting profit in Q3 was partially offset by a loss on limited partnership investments, which CNA maintains in its portfolio to provide equity-like returns with less volatility. This loss reduced CNA's profit contribution to Loews by $54 million versus the positive contribution of $17 million last year, a $71 million after-tax year-to-year swing.","Further reducing CNA's contribution to Q3 net income were realized investment losses of $29 million after tax compared to $24 million of after tax gains in Q3 2014. These losses were largely other than temporary impairments taken to give CNA the flexibility to sell certain securities Diamond's contribution to income from continuing operations was $47 million, up from $25 million for the same period last year. Two unusual items obscure the year-over-year comparison.","In last year's third quarter, Diamond impaired the carrying value of six rigs, which reduced its earnings contribution by $55 million. In this year's third quarter, we wrote off $20 million of goodwill on Loews' books associated with Diamond. Excluding these two unusual charges, earnings decreased modestly.","Contract drilling revenues fell 18% as the revenue increases from ultra deepwater and deepwater rigs failed to offset the lost revenue from mid-water and jack-up rigs. The company's rigorous expense management program brought contract drilling expenses down almost as much as the decline in contract drilling revenues. But depreciation and interest expense were up year-over-year, reflecting the delivery of the last two new build drill ships. Diamond's management is working hard to manage expenses and optimize the operating performance of its fleet during this difficult period in the offshore drilling market.","Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to income from continuing operations was $18 million in Q3 2015 as opposed to $8 million in Q3 2014. Boardwalk's net operating revenues were up, with growth projects, the Evangeline Pipeline, and the Gulf South rate case all contributing. This uptick in revenues outpaced expense increases including higher depreciation and interest expense. Additionally, at the Loews level, we benefited in the third quarter from a $6 million after tax franchise tax refund related to Boardwalk.","Loews and Boardwalk have a subordinated loan agreement in place under which Boardwalk can borrow up to $300 million at any time until the end of December. Boardwalk has not yet drawn under the agreement. We have agreed to extend the agreement to make the proceeds available to Boardwalk through year-end 2016.","Loews Hotels' contribution to income from continuing operations was $2 million during the third quarter, up from a minimal contribution last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $30 million, down slightly from the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA during Q3 was hurt by results in our wholly-owned hotels, particularly in our New York and Coronado properties. Notably, the four joint venture hotels at the Universal Orlando Resort continue to perform strongly, as did numerous other properties.","The parent company portfolio posted an after tax loss of $22 million in the third quarter, driven by losses incurred on equities in limited partnership investments, including gold-related investments. As a reminder, cash and equivalents make up about 70% of this $4.8 billion portfolio. We received $83 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter, $61 million from CNA, $9 million from Diamond, and $13 million from Boardwalk.","During the first nine months of the year, we received $733 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, up from $647 million for the same period in 2014.","During 2015. we have repurchased 19.6 million shares of Loews' common stock, over 5% of our beginning of year shares outstanding. We repurchased 7.6 million shares in the first half, 8.7 million shares during the third quarter, and 3.3 million shares thus far in Q4. In total, we have spent $753 million on share repurchase this year.","And with that, I will now hand the call back to Mary.","Mary Skafidas - Vice President-Investor & Public Relations","Thank you, David. Jackie, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Janney.","Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning, Loews. Jimmy, that's the most optimistic and open about valuation considerations for your subsidiaries. And I don't think you've ever before on a call, correct me if I'm right, foreshadowed that you might buy back stock for Loews if current valuations continue. In the past, you've had no common attitude about share repurchases and rarely you've ever commented that you thought subsidiary prices were cheap. What's driven the change in disclosure on buyback?","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","First of all, there is no change in disclosure. And secondly, I don't know that there was any foreshadowing. I was commenting about what happened in the third quarter and what's been happening this year. I was expressing some of my frustration with valuation of Loews and our subsidiaries. And I want to make clear, do not confuse frustration with complaining. While I'm frustrated, I also consider this a golden opportunity. And I think we've taken plenty of advantage of it having repurchased over $750 million worth of our stock this year.","But I caution you not to take what I said as foreshadow. Yes, I think the prices of our subsidiaries are depressed, but I don't know what that's necessarily going to mean in terms of our share repurchases going forward. We have lots of options. We consider \u2013 every day, we think about whether or not we want to buy shares, and there are always competing uses for our money. So we think about it and we can \u2013 as I think you know from our past experience, we can turn on a dime.","Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","I appreciate that. But I would still think from my experience listening to these calls, that was the most aggressive you've been in characterizing where the valuation of the subsidiaries are versus the sense of value?","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, one other thing I should add. The share price declines of both Diamond as well as Boardwalk were nothing short of spectacular. So, two out of three of our subsidiaries had very bad share price performance during the third quarter. And as I said at the outset, that was the elephant in the room and I wanted to address it.","Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Fair points. Thanks for your answers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, if I calculate declared dividend yields on the various properties, you guys are generating about $350 million in cash to the parents each year. But I assume that there is a high probability that CNA does another special, let's just say that gets up to $500 million, $600 million. When you're thinking about share repurchases, since you have plenty of cash and you have competing uses, how do you think about how much you're willing to deploy to buyback your own stock. What is the sort of difference, I guess, tethers that you wrestle with?","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, this year \u2013 I don't know where your numbers came from, let me give you mine. So, this year, we'll have about $800 million of cash flow from our subsidiaries and we've spent $750 million of that. We started the year with I think north of $5 billion in cash. And right now we have about $4.8 billion.","So \u2013 and we like to maintain a minimum of, say, $1.5 million to $2 million \u2013 $1.5 billion to $2 billion at least. So we see that we've got cash flow coming-in in the form of dividend and we have $3 billion of capital that can used for lots of different purposes. Share repurchases, investments in our subsidiaries, a new business or as I like to say, if there is nothing to do, we'll do nothing with it.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And what is the principal security that four-point-some-billion-dollars that's sitting. Is that in treasuries? Where is that right now?","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, there is about I guess $400 million to $500 million in stocks and another $900 million-or-so in hedge funds of one sort or another, and then the rest is in money market instruments of one sort or another that are paying us very, very little.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And in terms of the \u2013 I assume that obviously you can get that cash tomorrow. You're not selling stocks or the hedge fund positions in order to finance your repurchases, or maybe you are?","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, we're not. But the equity positions, as you all know, could be liquidated rather quickly. And with respect to our hedge funds, that portfolio was designed in part to be able to be liquidated over a number of quarters.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And I feel it will never be a full conference call without a hotel question.","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Go for it.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. So, when you look at the map and you think about the network effects for business travelers, who need a \u2013 who want to be in a hotel network that has critical mass in all the major cities, how many more hotels do you need to be competitive from that perspective of a loyalty program?","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say a handful of hotels. I think that we've done \u2013 over the past four years or five years, we've covered a lot of the map with Boston, Washington, Chicago, we have two, Minneapolis and San Francisco. So, we've come a long way. There are \u2013 there are other cities that we'd like to be in. We're moving forward on plans to develop some hotels and we're looking to acquire others. So there's still room to go, but we're hard at work on it.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And can you rank preference for buying a hotel outright, getting into a JOA or just doing the management of the property?","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Listen, I like capital light. So, management is always number one, but with management, you don't control the asset, and in some ways, you don't control your own fate. A partnership is the next best thing because that's not capital light, but it's capital lighter, so that we don't have to put up all the money for the hotel. And the third alternative is for us to buy 100% of the hotel, which we have done a number of times. What we look to do when we buy 100% of a hotel is that over the next one year to two years we look to sell down a percentage interest in that hotel so we don't have as much cash invested in the property.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Well, thank you for all the answers. And good luck in the days to come.","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Thank you. Can you give us an idea, maybe a rough idea of what kind of growth you expect, say, in the next two years, next five years in Loews?","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In Loews Corp?","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","In the total value of earnings of Loews Corp, yes.","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You know, Michael, I'm pleased to say that we don't make forecasts for our business. So, I can't really respond to you. What we talk about more than earnings is value and we talk about that over three years to five years. And let me just say, I would be disappointed if the value of Loews did not increase significantly over that time period.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Would you care to define significantly?","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. But I know it when I see it.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","One of those...","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","And so, maybe looking at this with more of a magnifying glass is where \u2013 can you rank the contributions from your current subs and maybe future subs?","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, when you say contributions, what do you mean exactly?","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","What I mean is, right now, roughly I guess CNA represents kind of two-thirds of valuation and going down a list?","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So, let me take a stab and tell me if I answered your question. So, CNA is the big gorilla in the room. CNA as you correctly say represents two-thirds of the value of Loews. And also generates probably \u2013 this past year, it generated 80% or 85% of our cash flow.","Behind that are Boardwalk and Diamond Offshore. I would say that both are recuperating. Diamond Offshore, as you know, cut its dividend so that it could get off of the MLP treadmill. Cut that distribution in January and has been able to finance its growth with primarily internally generated funds, and as I said in my remarks, has very good growth prospects going forward. We're looking forward to that $1.5 billion of organic growth coming online. There is still more organic growth that they're hoping to put on the books. So even though Boardwalk doesn't \u2013 isn't paying out significant dividends, it is building its business and its network, and we're really very pleased with that.","At Diamond Offshore, it is the strongest company in its industry. It has investment grade ratings, it's got cash available to it to invest, and it's just waiting for the opportune time to invest in more rig assets. Diamond Offshore, as you will recall, between 2006 and 2014 paid out $41 a share of dividend. So to Loews Corporation that represented almost $3 billion.","And there was a time when instead of Diamond stock being $20 a share, it were seven times higher. So it represented very significant value to Loews. Now, I'm not predicting that Diamond is going to go back to $140 anytime soon. But I do think that in the fullness of time and once this oil cycle has played itself out and oil prices are back to where I would considered to be equilibrium prices that Diamond Offshore shares can improve as well.","And then finally, I'd say that with respect to Loews Hotels, it doesn't have a lot of earnings, but it does have a lot of value. The hotels in our portfolio, many of them are the envy of a lot of people in the hotel business. And the goal of Loews Hotels is to continue building the value of the company. As I said, it may be difficult for you to see in the form of net income. We do show adjusted EBITDA as a measure to help give you some ability to get value of the business. But I'd simply end by saying that \u2013 as I've said before, I love all my children, I love all our businesses, and I think each one of them is doing well within the context of their industry.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","So, it's no mention of maybe the using \u2013 using your metaphor \u2013 to adopt any new children?","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're always looking to do that. But right now, I can't love a child that I haven't yet adopted.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","So would you think that there is more opportunity now than there has been in the last several years?","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","To buy another business?","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Yes.","James S. Tisch - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I think right now, things are generally priced for perfection. And as I continuously say, we kick a lot of tires, but we just haven't found the right thing.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","That was our final question.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to hand our program over to Mary Skafidas, Vice President of Investor Media Relations. Please go ahead.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Kristin. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Loews Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter and year end 2015 earnings conference call. A copy of our earnings release, earnings snapshot and company overview maybe found on our website, loews.com.","On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch and our Chief Financial Officer, David Edelson. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward-looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those projections made in any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is only a brief summary of the company\u2019s statutory forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. During the call today, we may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our security filings for reconciliation for the most comparable GAAP measures.","I will now turn the call over to Loews\u2019 Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch.","Jim Tisch","Thank you, Mary, and good morning everyone. Last quarter, I spent a great deal of time talking about the decline in the share prices of each of our publicly traded subsidiaries starting my remarks by referring to these declines as the proverbial elephant in the room. Well, unfortunately, that elephant has not gone away and chaos continues to reign over the energy markets.","Case in point. On November 2, the day of our last earnings call, oil was trading just below $47 a barrel. Although we didn\u2019t like that number then, it looks pretty good compared to today since oil prices have continued to plummet. On January 20, oil dropped below $27 a barrel far below its replacement cost. If these pricing levels persist over the next 2 years, we will be in a drastically undersupplied oil market. The natural gas market is under the same dark cloud as the entire energy industry is being affected by this precipitous downturn, which has led to a steep decline in capital spending by exploration and production companies.","Oil price declines have largely been driven by the exceptional strength of supply, not by the weakness of demand. In fact, demand for oil is still growing and remains quite healthy. If there is any bright spots on which to focus it\u2019s that the lack of drilling activity today will only help speed up the recovery in the oil market tomorrow. As they say in the oil business, the best cure for low prices is low prices.","While we wait for market rebalancing in oil prices, the reality for offshore drilling companies is stark. The drop in oil prices is causing oil companies to slash exploration and development budgets and reduce or cancel drilling contracts decimating day rates and idling rigs. The market for rigs of all types, including new ultra-deepwater drill ships, is currently and will for the immediate future be drastically oversupplied. And although Diamond Offshore\u2019s conservative financial management has allowed us to enter this downturn on solid footing, it\u2019s not immune from these challenging industry dynamics. Diamond has had to make some tough decisions regarding its own fleet, writing down 9 rigs in the fourth quarter. David Edelson will provide more details later on in the call.","I did want to point out that the Ocean Confidence represents about 65% of the write-down. The rig is currently stacked, but we believe it will be a viable rig once the offshore drilling market comes back. And I believe that that market will come back. It\u2019s just a question of when. By some estimates, offshore oil production supplies up to 30% of the world\u2019s oil, a significant percentage that cannot be replaced by conventional onshore drilling or shale production. Despite this severe downturn, Diamond continues to work tirelessly to navigate these troubled waters, having made the difficult decision to cut its dividend. This action will bolster Diamond\u2019s already strong balance sheet and allow the company to capitalize on possible opportunities to acquire rig assets in the future at a substantial discount to shipyard prices.","Turning to the natural gas markets and Boardwalk, over the last few years, despite low prices, natural gas production has grown significantly. This growth was supported by two key dynamics. The first was the increase in oil production from shale plays. The majority of oil wells in these plays also yield significant amounts of natural gas as a byproduct of oil production. This associated gas accounted for nearly half of all the growth in gas production in the country. The second dynamic was the discovery and rapid development of the Marcellus shale. Well economics in the Marcellus were heavily subsidized by the production of natural gas liquids, which are sold at prices linked to oil. As a result, about a year ago, companies could breakeven when drilling a Marcellus well even with natural gas price below $2 per MCF. As a result, the market was flooded with lots of cheap gas. Today, these two dynamics have changed dramatically. As oil prices have collapsed, oil production from shale plays has started to decline, with associated gas production following suit.","Natural gas production growth is stalling everywhere as producers cut drilling activity in response to the steep drop in NGL and natural gas prices. Midstream companies have been particularly affected by the pall hanging over the E&P industry. The share price of some of these companies has dropped by over 75% in the past 8 months as the effects of reduced drilling and weakened financials have rippled through the industry. Two years ago Boardwalk made the painful but important decision to reduce its distribution, a decision that many of its competitors are making now. In retrospect, this was a wise choice as Boardwalk has been using its internally generated cash flow to fund organic growth projects and position the company for the future. We believe that the new projects that Boardwalk has lined up are good investments and we are hopeful that they will provide Boardwalk with an un-levered double-digit rate of return on assets as they are completed over the next 1 to 3 years. Although Boardwalk continues to face market headwinds, the company remains financially sound and continues to focus on future growth and capital generation for its shareholders.","CNA is a bright spot in Loews\u2019 portfolio of businesses right now even though the numbers this quarter may obscure that light. There were lots of moving parts in CNA\u2019s fourth quarter results, most significantly, a reserve charge in its long-term care business. The silver lining of the LTC charge is that it should mitigate future losses in CNA\u2019s long-term care book of business. Despite the noise in the results, I want to stress that CNA\u2019s underlying businesses are solid and it continues to maintain its strong capital position.","CNA\u2019s commercial lines business made steady progress, with a full year combined ratio improvement of almost 8 points due to a combination of favorable loss development and underlying loss ratio improvement. CNA\u2019s specialty lines continued to perform well, although market conditions in certain areas are more challenged. CNA\u2019s balance sheet remains stellar ending the year with statutory capital of over $10.7 billion and GAAP shareholder\u2019s equity of almost $11.8 billion. As a result of this robust capital position and stable P&C earnings, CNA announced today a $2 per share special dividend, which is in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. As a point of reference, last year, CNA also paid a $2 per share special dividend.","And as a final note, in November of 2015, CNA announced that Dino Robusto will become its next CEO. Dino will join CNA towards the end of 2016 when Tom Motamed retires. The CNA that Dino will inherit is poised for continued improvement and further value creation. At a later date, I will spend more time talking about Tom\u2019s many accomplishments with the company. But for now, we are looking forward to another great year at CNA with him at the helm.","Now let\u2019s take a look at Loews\u2019 cash position. We ended the year with $4.3 billion in cash and investments, having spent $1.3 billion during the year buying back Loews stock. In fact, we have repurchased more of our own shares in 2015 than any single year since 1993. CNA\u2019s special dividend payment to Loews when received in March will increase our cash and investments by about $500 million. Assuming a regular dividend is paid each quarter, CNA will pay Loews dividends totaling about $730 million in 2016. ","Most of our almost effective lever for value creation in 2015 was repurchasing our own shares. Our other two levers are making opportune investments at the Holding Company level and investing in our subsidiaries. Over the years, each of these levers has contributed greatly to contributing long-term value for our shareholders.","The foundation for all of Loews\u2019 long-term valuation, value creation is, however our commitment to maintaining our financial strength and stability. Our prudent capital management will ensure that the financial health we have built out of bricks can continue to withstand whatever economic huffing and puffing may come our way.","Now I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson.","David Edelson","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Loews reported a fourth quarter net loss of $201 million or $0.58 per share. Both CNA Financial and Diamond Offshore posted quarterly losses driven by unusual items. Excluding unusual items, which I will describe more fully, Loews\u2019 income from continuing operations declined from $264 million in Q4 2014 to $183 million in Q4 2015. For the full year, Loews had income from continuing operations of $260 million or $0.72 per share, compared to $962 million or $2.52 per share for the prior year. Unusual items and lower operating results at CNA and Diamond were the main drivers of the year-over-year decline. Excluding unusual items, our income from continuing operations declined from $1.1 billion in 2014 to $858 million in 2015.","I will start by reviewing our fourth quarter results and then return to the full year. CNA\u2019s earnings in Q4 2015 were reduced by a reserve charge, as Jim mentioned related to its long-term care business, as well as by a change in accounting estimate adopted to better reflect the yields on fixed maturity securities that have call provisions. The long-term care reserve charge and the accounting change reduced Loews\u2019 income from continuing operations by $177 million and $22 million, respectively. Absent these two unusual items in 2015 and a non-recurring pension settlement charge in 2014, CNA\u2019s fourth quarter net operating income decreased by 35% versus Q4 2014. Several factors contributed to the fourth quarter year-over-year decline in net operating income at CNA, excluding these unusual items; lower LP income, higher catastrophe losses, less favorable prior year development and lower non-cat accident year underwriting income, driven by higher loss ratios in specialty and international and an expense ratio that was about 2 points above the company\u2019s run rate. Partially offsetting these negative factors was the continued market improvement in commercial\u2019s loss ratio.","Let me take a moment to discuss the long-term care reserve charge. CNA concluded its annual LTC reserve review during the fourth quarter. When CNA applied its current best estimate actuarial assumptions to its long-term care reserves, the result was the $396 million increase in reserve estimate. Given that CNA had $100 million of margin before the review, this increase resulted in what\u2019s known as an unlocking and a $296 million pretax reserve charge at the CNA level. I would note that this is a GAAP reserve charge. The unlocking does not impact CNA\u2019s statutory surplus. CNA\u2019s LTC active life reserves are now based on its current best estimate assumptions. Future periodic income for long-term care will reflect any variance between actual experience and the reset assumptions contemplated in CNA\u2019s best estimate reserves. The reset assumptions should theoretically produce a breakeven underwriting results for long-term care, although there will undoubtedly be variability in CNA\u2019s future periodic results.","Diamond Offshore\u2019s fourth quarter reflects the challenging market conditions that Jim referred to earlier. Diamond\u2019s results in Q4 2015 were dominated by a $499 million pretax asset impairment charge, which reduced Loews\u2019 income from continuing operations by $182 million. Diamond wrote down nine rigs in the fourth quarter, five jack-ups, two mid-water floaters and two deepwater floaters. Setting aside the rig impairment charges, Diamond contributed $60 million to our Q4 income from continuing operations, up 28% from the fourth quarter of 2014. While contract drilling revenues were down meaningfully, after tax earnings benefited from expense reductions and a favorable tax rate. Diamond management is working hard to control expenses in the face of such difficult market conditions.","Boardwalk posted a strong quarter as its contribution to our income from continuing operations increased from $11 million in Q4 2014 to $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Boardwalk\u2019s net operating revenues were up 10% in the quarter and its expenses were essentially flat, resulting in a significant increase in its net income. Several factors drove Boardwalk\u2019s revenue increase, including the Gulf South rate case, the Evangeline Pipeline being back in service and growth projects coming online. Loews Hotels contributed a slight loss to our income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s net income was hampered by an impairment charge on a joint venture equity interest in a hotel property as well as by hotel opening expenses, higher depreciation, losses posted at certain recently acquired properties and some unusual tax items. Remember that for acquired properties, there is typically a transitioned period as the property becomes a Loews\u2019 branded hotel. Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is disclosed in our earnings snapshot, increased from $35 million in Q4 of 2014 to $38 million in Q4 2015.","Let me now turn to a brief discussion of the full year. CNA and Diamond accounted for the bulk of the year-over-year earnings decline, with reduced parent company investment income also contributed to the decline. CNA contributed $433 million to our income from continuing operations in 2015, down from $802 million in 2014. Included in these results are after-tax realized investment losses of $34 million in 2015 versus realized investment gains of $32 million in 2014. Unusual items figured prominently in the year-over-year decline. The fourth quarter long-term care reserve charge and accounting change and the second quarter retroactive reinsurance charge combined to reduce CNA\u2019s earnings contribution by $237 million in 2015. In 2014, unusual items reduced CNA\u2019s earnings contribution by $30 million, resulting in a $207 million year-on-year negative swing. Absent unusual items, CNA\u2019s net operating income was down 12% in 2015. Key drivers of this NOI decline were significantly lower LP income, slightly lower non-cat accident year underwriting income and higher operating losses in the Life & Group segment, caused largely by adverse morbidity in the long-term care business. Partially offsetting the decline was higher favorable net prior year development.","Diamond contributed $156 million loss of our income from continuing operations in 2015 whereas in 2014, it contributed an income of $183 million. During 2015, Diamond booked $870 million of pretax asset impairment and restructuring charges, which reduced Loews\u2019 income from continuing operations by $344 million. Additionally, earlier in 2015, Loews wrote off $20 million of goodwill associated with Diamond. In 2014, Diamond\u2019s asset impairments reduced Loews\u2019 after-tax income by $55 million. Absent the impairment and restructuring charges and goodwill write-offs, Diamond\u2019s contribution to our income from continuing operations declined by $30 million to $208 million, reflecting the substantial decline in revenues from pure rigs operating. Boardwalk pipeline\u2019s contribution income from continuing operations rose to $74 million in 2015 from the prior year\u2019s $18 million, while strong operating results helped. The biggest driver of the year-over-year increase was the write-off in 2014 of capitalized cost associated with the terminated project, which reduced Loews\u2019 2014 income from continuing operations by $55 million.","Loews Hotels contributed $12 million to our 2015 income, up from $11 million in 2014. Profitability was hampered by the results at a few recently acquired hotels and hotels with operational challenges. On the other hand, numerous properties, including the properties at the Universal Orlando Resort, were up nicely versus 2014.","Adjusted EBITDA for Loews Hotels is up 29% year-over-year to $158 million. For the full year, parent company after-tax investment income was down from $63 million in 2014 to $16 million in 2015, reflecting lower performance of equities and alternatives. As a Jim mentioned at year end, cash and investments totaled $4.3 billion as compared to $4.8 billion at the end of September and $5.1 billion at the end of 2014.","Jim already mentioned our substantial share repurchases during Q4 and the full year, but let me reiterate. During the fourth quarter, we spent $632 million, repurchasing 17 million shares. For the full year, we bought back 33.3 million shares for a total of $1.26 billion. This represents just under 9% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015. Thus far, during 2016, we have repurchased 919,000 additional shares.","During the fourth quarter, we received $83 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $61 million from CNA, $9 million from Diamond and $13 million from Boardwalk. During all of 2015, we received $816 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, up from $782 million in 2014. As Jim mentioned today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend, which is in addition to its regular $0.25 per share quarterly dividend. Combining the two, Loews expects to receive $545 million in dividends from CNA this quarter.","Let me now hand the call back to Jim.","Jim Tisch","Thank you, David. Before we proceed to our Q&A, let me review why I am confident about the long-term prospects of each of our businesses. CNA has improved its underwriting performance and paid significant dividends to shareholders, while maintaining its strong capital position. Diamond is in a tough market. And although we can\u2019t predict when its market will turnaround Diamond is ready to weather the storm. It\u2019s been conserving its financial resources and maintaining its position as the strongest offshore drilling company in terms of finance, innovation and leadership. Hopefully, during these challenging times for the offshore drilling industry, Diamond will be able to add productive rate assets at attractive valuations.","Boardwalk has made smart capital decisions that should allow us to fund its announced growth projects without having to issue equity in 2016. And Loews Hotels continues to grow its chain steadily with an eye towards profitability. Whether confronting headwinds or aided by tailwinds Loews\u2019 strategic imperative remains the same creating value for shareholders over the long-term.","And now, I would like to turn the call back to Mary Skafidas.","Mary Skafidas","Thanks, Jim. Kristin, we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of our call. Could you please give participants the instructions on how they can participate?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Good morning, everyone.","Jim Tisch","Good morning.","Josh Shanker","So, my first question, I guess a Boardwalk question. I would like to talk about the investment cycle versus the distribution cycle. And how you think about \u2013 how long Boardwalk will invest and when you might be seeing dividend begin to increase?","Jim Tisch","So, as you know, Boardwalk right now has about $1.6 billion of investments that it\u2019s funding. Hopefully this year, it will find more attractive projects to do. It is also working to bring down its ratio of debt to EBITDA and it\u2019s been very successful with that this past year in 2015. It would be very nice for Boardwalk to be able to increase its distribution. And by the way, Loews would be the biggest beneficiary of such an increase. But Boardwalk will not do that until such time as it has the distributable cash flow available to it and total access to markets in order that the dividend could be increased responsibly. I cannot give you a date for when that\u2019s going to happen. But even without the dividend, we believe that the management of Boardwalk is building tremendous value with these new projects that it\u2019s embarked upon.","Josh Shanker","So Jim, I am not asking for a date so much, but in Board level meetings, is there a general census that there is an investment stage followed by a distribution stage? And is it part of a cycle or is this very Boardwalk specific?","Jim Tisch","I think this is Boardwalk specific. You are asking about what\u2019s going on in the Boardwalk Board meeting. I am not a Board member there and I think you should ask the management of Boardwalk that.","Josh Shanker","That\u2019s very reasonable. Hotels, I noticed that the earnings power is much stronger in the first half of the year. As you grow, is there a seasonality to earnings? ","Jim Tisch","Yes, there are some modest seasonalities, but we also have a pretty balanced portfolio, so that when city hotels may not be doing well, then, for example, over Christmas, then resort hotels do, do well. But overall, there isn\u2019t dramatic seasonality to the business.","Josh Shanker","So in terms of \u2013 I am not really asking - some modeling questions thinking what looks like seasonality for 2015 could totally be less apparent in 2016?","David Edelson","Yes. I think what you are saying is more the impact of pre-opening expenses at hotels, a new hotel coming in and ramping up, etcetera, less seasonality.","Josh Shanker","Okay, that makes sense. And then I think in the past, you said back in the financial crisis, public equities got cheap, but private equity never got cheap enough to act on new investments the way you like. You are sitting on a lot of potentially optionality, I guess, with the cash you have. Do you have a market appetite? And are you looking at private equity or public equity saying this is a market for Loews and I would like to make something happen in the next 12 months, 18 months? I don\u2019t know, how do you think about that?","Jim Tisch","We look at what\u2019s available to buy. A lot of the assets that become \u2013 companies that become available to buy, especially in the strike zone that we are looking at are owned by private equity firms. And those companies, those firms have the ability to time when they want to sell their assets. So, one would think that right now prices of companies that private equity firms might want to sell are coming down, because the financing markets have become so much more expensive. But in fact, what we are seeing is not too much that\u2019s on the market. In fact because now it\u2019s not a particularly attractive time to be selling those businesses. If the financial markets that we have today continue for another several quarters, then it\u2019s entirely possible that we could see assets that come on the market that could be attractively priced.","Josh Shanker","Okay. Well, good luck in finding something. We would love to see it.","Jim Tisch","In the meantime though, we spent $1.3 billion repurchasing our shares. So that was a significant use of our cash over 2015.","Josh Shanker","I understand there is more of them available.","Jim Tisch","Yes.","Josh Shanker","Take care. Thank you.","Jim Tisch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Capital.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning Loews. Quick numbers question, what was the impairment in hotels?","David Edelson","It was \u2013 it hit by $3 million after-tax.","Bob Glasspiegel","Okay. Question two, on the CNA call, when I asked them about partnerships, their partnerships were down about $400 million year-over-year and they said they have been selling ahead of this market weakness, reducing partnerships and would continue to reduce, reflecting sort of a cautious view on equities in that sort of asset class. I was wondering if \u2013 I assume that\u2019s consistent with or perhaps even driven by your outlook, then maybe you could expand on that strategy and where you are and with the market down 10% year-to-date?","Jim Tisch","Sure. CNA manages its risk assets very carefully because CNA wants to make sure that risk assets do not become too big a percentage of its equity. And additionally, Loews in helping to manage those assets for CNA also is seeing attractive risk investments beyond the hedge fund market. So for example, if you look at bank loans that are available in the marketplace, there has been a tremendous sell-off in many names that now to us are seemingly good investments. So the move out of hedge funds was made in order to make room for additional risk assets that CNA can acquire that we think will be more attractive investments than the hedge funds have been. For the past 20 years, hedge funds have been a very, very attractive investment of risk assets. And what we are seeing now is just that there are other places where we can invest and get good returns.","Bob Glasspiegel","I would love to go back to the transcript, I thought they had said they had a cautious view towards equities before the sell-off and we are likely to continue the reduced exposure to equities, but that doesn\u2019t square necessarily within and you publicly wanted to say about equities at this point?","Jim Tisch","So actually my comment was pretty consistent with that. I was talking about attractive investments that we are seeing in the bank loan and fixed income markets. And listen, from my own personal point of view, the more equities go down, the more attractive they get. So at Loews, as the stock market has been going down, we have been modestly increasing our exposure to equities.","Bob Glasspiegel","Got it. You have been right on sort of your macro views the economy is going to grow gradually and slowly and positively as far as I could see it, I think what\u2019s your comment originally 5 years ago and is that \u2013 are you still in that camp?","Jim Tisch","I am. I am doing better than a stopped clock. A stopped clock is right twice a day. My 2% forecast for the economy has been right for 5 years, so why I change it now?","Bob Glasspiegel","Well, there are people a little bit nervous about some more risks and out there and beyond energy, European credit, but these...?","Jim Tisch","There is a lot to be worried about in the world. But I also think that those of us that are on Wall Street can sometimes be overwhelmed by the problems that we see on the horizon. And I think from time-to-time, it\u2019s important to step back, take off your Wall Street glasses and put on industrial America glasses. And I think things don\u2019t look as bad when you look that \u2013 with that lens.","Bob Glasspiegel","No, I am in your camp, too. I just wanted to make sure you were still there. Thank you.","Jim Tisch","Thank you, Bob.","David Edelson","Thanks Bob.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Millman with Millman Research.","Michael Millman","So would you suggest or should investors rather than buying Diamond, for example, be buying crude and buying gas futures or crude futures I should say and gas futures rather than Boardwalk to get kind of a pure play and maybe quicker upside when and if there is upside?","Jim Tisch","I am not a registered rep. I don\u2019t give out the public investment advice. There are an awful lot of different ways to play what I think I and you are describing as the improvement in oil and natural gas prices. And it all depends on the risk parameters that you are willing to take, the amount of leverage that you want, a whole host of factors that I think it\u2019s inappropriate for me to opine on right now.","Michael Millman","Does Loews at all invest in futures of this type?","Jim Tisch","Yes. In fact, yes Loews has plenty of exposure to crude oil and to gas through Boardwalk and as well through Diamond Offshore. And to the extent that those commodities go up in place for long enough, then we should see improvement in Diamond\u2019s business and hopefully an increase in Diamond\u2019s share price. And likewise, we should see improvements in Boardwalk\u2019s business and its share price as well. Beyond that, yes, we have invested in some futures in the oil markets. We are sort of like the guy who ran for mayor, he said the rent is too damn low or too damn high, we say oil prices are too damn low. And so I believe that in a number of years, I am not making a prediction for the next number of months, but in the next number of years, we think that oil prices will be significantly higher than the levels we are at today.","Michael Millman","Okay, I appreciate the color.

Jim, over to you.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Mary, and good morning. I want to start by showing my thoughts on the financial markets, as a backdrop to what guided our approach to capital allocation in 2016. I've been around long enough to have lived through all sorts of markets. I've learned to respect markets, while at the same time being skeptical of conventional wisdom. I've lived through a bond bare market and a gargantuan bond bull market. I've seen bond yields above 15% and below 2%. I've seen inflationary spirals, I've seen deflationary threats, I've seen deregulation and reregulation. I've seen the S&P 500 trade as high as 30 times earnings and I've seen the S&P trade as low as 7 times earnings.","With all this experience, that comes with age I might add, here is what I'm seeing in the markets today. In the credit markets, spreads on the high yield securities are approaching historically tight levels, while key credit metrics such as leverage and coverage ratios are showing signs of weakening. The leverage loan market has been overrun by such massive inflows of capital that you could probably get alone to buy a fleet of zeppelins at this point in time.","With respect to rates, the 10-year treasury note is currently trading at around 2.5%, up from its recent lows, but still well below historic norms. In my view, the mood of these markets is in stark contrast with the many unknown from our current economic and political landscape, both here and abroad. For me, it's a major disconnect, and it concerns me.","The optimism in the rates and credit markets is likewise reflected in the public equity and merger markets. The S&P 500 is trading at roughly 19 times earnings, 3 turns higher than the 50-year average of 2016. These valuations make me uncomfortable, especially given the unknowns in taxation, foreign trade, regulation and more.","The merger market is being driven by large pools of private and corporate buyers, the wave of private capital combined with the abundance of available leverage at remarkably low rates has enabled private equity firms to pay big prices for company that haven't already been gobbled up by strategic buyers.","To sum up, in my opinion, the markets are priced for perfection, and they have been that way for quite some time, complacency reign supreme. However, my experience has shown me that this state of affairs won't go on indefinitely. So why am I sharing these thoughts with you? Because I know that some of you have wondered why we brought back relatively few Loews shares in 2016 or why Loews hasn't made an acquisition.","In terms of the first question, looking back over 2016 with a benefit of 2020 hindsight, I wish we had repurchased more stock in the first half of the year, when Loews shares were trading at lower prices, and when the S&P was 20% lower than recent levels. As the equity market climbed to record heights during the second half of 2016, Loews' common stock moved along with it and we became cautious. And we are more comfortable buying shares back when the market is at its lows rather than when it's hitting new highs. While we remain positive on our shares and see real potential for our subsidiaries, we also know that Loews' stock price is positively correlated to the overall equity markets.","Unlike many other companies, we don't have set quotas for share purchases in a given year. We use our judgment to buyback our stock at the lowest price possible. Sometimes we look like heroes, like when we bought 9% of our stock in 2015. And there are other times, having not purchased shares may make us look like we are asleep at the switch, but I promise you, we are not. Over the span of time measured in years and decades, we're proud of our record and we feel that our share repurchases have created significant value for our shareholders.","As for the second question about adding another leg to the stool, we continue to kick tires looking for the right company at the right price. One of our shareholders recently asked, if my foot is getting sore and I have to admit it is. Valuations in the merger markets have made our acquisition search difficult and frustrating. We always try to invest only when all the pieces of a transaction from valuation to potential cash flow to future industry dynamics add up to a solid idea. And while I won't comment in detail, last year, we did get pretty far down the road towards making an acquisition. In the end, however, the pieces did not all fit together the way we'd hoped they would.","It's a tough market in which to be a disciplined buyer. I assure you that we remain committed to our longstanding philosophy of creating value for all shareholders through prudent capital allocation. Sometimes we accomplish this through share repurchases, sometimes by acquiring a new business, sometimes through an investment in one of our existing subsidiaries, or sometimes we choose to take the action of taking no action.","Our liquidity gives us tremendous strategic and financial flexibility. We will never stop using our best judgment to balance risk and reward to build value for all our shareholders. And we are confident that despite today's market exuberance, we will find opportunities in the future that benefit us all.","Now, over to our CFO, David Edelson.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone.","For the fourth quarter, Loews reported net income of $268 million or $0.79 per share, up meaningfully from a net loss of $201 million or $0.58 per share in last year's fourth quarter. CNA was the major contributor to our net income this quarter, accounting for just over 80% of the total.","Let me start by identifying the key drivers of our quarterly year-over-year earnings improvement, after which I will briefly touch on our full year results. Pages 12 and 13 of our earnings supplement set forth the key drivers for both periods. The supplement is available via webcast and is also posted to the Loews' IR website.","Our results in the fourth quarter of 2015 were depressed by two unusual items, totaling $359 million. The $177 million charge related to the unlocking of CNA's long-term care active life reserves and the $182 million rig impairment charge at Diamond. Excluding these items, CNA's contribution to our Q4 net income rose $110 million year-over-year. Four main items drove this quarterly increase, the first three of which related to CNA.","First, CNA's Life & Group business, which contributed a loss of $40 million in Q4 2015, excluding the reserve charge, contributed $18 million to our net income in Q4 2016, creating a $58 million year-over-year variance. As discussed on prior calls, the unlocking of CNA's long-term care active life reserves at year end 2015 serves to favorably impact subsequent Life & Group operating results. By resetting these reserves based on management's best estimates, long-term care should on average generate breakeven results, if actual experience is in line with those estimates.","Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2016, CNA released long-term care claims reserves, which drove the positive contribution. Even without the claims reserve release, however, the Life & Group segment essentially broke even versus last year's loss.","Second, net investment income generated by CNA's P&C and corporate segments accounted for $36 million of the positive year-over-year variance. Higher returns on LP investments were a big driver as was the negative impact on Q4 2015 NII of a change in accounting estimate adopted to better reflect the yield on fixed maturity securities that have call provisions.","Third, CNA posted realized investment gains this year versus realized losses in last year's fourth quarter. This swing amounted to $39 million year-over-year. Realized investment results in both years stemmed mostly from normal portfolio actions and other than temporary impairments taken to maintain flexibility.","And fourth, Loews parent company net investment company was up $13 million after-tax year-over-year. The increase was largely from alternative investments, offset impart by gold-related equities. The main downdraft in the quarter was Diamond Offshore, as the difficult conditions in the offshore drilling space showed no signs of abating. Diamond's contribution to our Q4 net income, excluding last year's rig impairments declined from $60 million in Q4 2015 to $36 million in Q4 2016. This $24 million negative swing was largely attributable to the 29% revenue decline at Diamond, caused by fewer rig operating and thus fewer revenue earning days, offset partially by a contract dispute settlement with a client.","Both Boardwalk and Loews Hotels had strong quarters. Boardwalk experienced a 9% increase in net revenues, that translated into robust profit growth. And at Loews Hotels income was up as most properties experienced year-over-year profit growth and the effect of tax rate declined.","Let me now turn to a brief review of the drivers of our full year results. For the full year, Loews reported net income of $632 million or $1.87 per share, up from $260 million or $0.72 per share in the prior year. Again, CNA was the major contributor to our full year net income. The same two unusual items that impacted the quarterly comparison also affected the full year.","The long-term care reserve charge booked in Q4 2015 reduced our 2015 net income by a $177 million, and rig impairment charges of Diamond reduced our net income in 2015 by $341 million and by $267 million in 2016. Absent the long-term care reserve charge and rig impairments, our net income increased by $121 million year-over-year. As in Q4, the main positive drivers of this increase were CNA and parent company investment income, with Diamond Offshore being the main counterbalance.","CNA benefited from higher earnings in its Life & Group segment, given the positive impact on 2016 earnings of the long-term care reserve unlocking at year end 2015. CNA also benefited from increases in favorable prior-year development, net investment income and realized investment gains. A modest decline in accident year underwriting income partially offset these positives. Parent company net investment income was up substantially year-over-year. Gold-related equities drove the increase with fixed income, alternatives and other equities, also contributing nicely.","On the other side of the ledger, Diamond's contribution to our net income absent the impairment charges declined from 2015 to 2016. The deterioration in the offshore drilling market led to fewer working rigs, fewer revenue earning days, and a 35% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues.","Loews continue to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $5 billion, broken down as follows; 62% cash and short-term investments, 12% fixed maturities, 17% limited partnership investments and 9% marketable equity securities. And as you know, we maintain a large and liquid portfolio of cash and investments for two principal reasons; to enable us to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves and to help mitigate risk during uncertain times.","During the fourth quarter, we received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $780 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing $726 million of that total. Today CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. Combining the two, Loews will receive $546 million in dividends from CNA this quarter.","Our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter was modest at 456,000 shares. During all of 2016, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of Loews or about 1% of our outstanding at an average price of just under $39 per share. Year-over-year, average shares outstanding were down 2.7% in the quarter and 6.7% for the full year.","I will now hand the call back to Jim.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Thank you, David. Before we open up the call to questions, I want to take a moment to talk about the leadership that we have in place in each of our subsidiaries. Dino Robusto joined CNA in November of 2016 as its CEO. While we have already seen in this short period of time is his strategic thinking, his operational expertise, and his tremendous drive. He has really energized the employees, brokers and agents of CNA. Marc Edwards and team at Diamond Offshore are in a tough market that it has only gotten tougher. Marc has been doing a phenomenal job in leading Diamond through this turbulent period and certainly deserves combat pay. Stan Horton, at Boardwalk is one of the most respected CEO's in the natural gas transportation space. Under his leadership, Boardwalk has continued to strengthen its balance sheet, while strategically building out the company's transportation system and advantageously utilizing its existing assets.","And last but certainly not least, Jon Tisch at Loews Hotels is a star in the hotel industry, and he's leading one of the industry's premier brands into its next phase of growth. I want to thank each of our CEOs for the many contributions they are making to Loews and to its shareholders.","Now, back to Mary.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Jim. Lorie, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now opened for questions. Your first question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel of Janney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning. Jim, you've been a longtime advocate of sort of slow growth economic scenario. And I'm wondering President Trump election happened after the last quarter conference call, does his ascendancy to the Presidency change your view of what GDP growth is and impact at all how you think about investing? I understand, you think the market's ahead of itself, expensive, et cetera, but does it change your economic outlook at all?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","I think it's too early to tell. Well, we've seen from some of his statements and some of the executive orders is a push towards reducing cumbersome rules and regulations. And I think that is positive. But what we're really going to have to wait to see is what happens with the major economic legislation that comes before Congress. There's only so much that a President can do and then there's a lot that Congress can do. So we've got to wait and see what happens to fiscal spending. We've got to wait and see what happens to taxation. We've got to wait and see what happens to healthcare and a whole bunch of other legislation. So I would say that I am hopeful, but I think also it's too early to tell.","One number that I calculated recently is really, really extraordinary. And that is that, as you know, for the past six, seven years, we've grown at about 2% a year and we have a $20 trillion economy in the United States. The difference between growing at 2% a year and 4% a year in terms of the cumulative additional GDP from 4% versus 2% is $25 trillion. That means that if you grow at 2% rather than 4%, in 10 years, you get the equivalent of 1.25 additional years of GDP.","So that's just an indication of how important and how beneficial pro-growth policies will be in the United States. I believe that for the past six or seven years, the malaise that we've seen in the U.S. psyche was due to the fact that we had anemic growth, and I think that stronger growth can make a very significant difference. Now, we'll see if the man in Office and the Republicans in the House and Senate can help create the environment where business can achieve that.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","So that's a glimmer in daylight of hope that I haven't heard from you in a long time. But bottom-line, what you're saying is nothing to change, investments, capital management, views on valuation, investing, et cetera stay the course on what you've been doing.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","That's exactly right. As I said in my prepared remarks, there are a lot of unknowns at this point in time. And listen, in the markets you pay a lot for certainty, so you've got to make some bets, but I think there's also a lot of room for uncertainty here.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Last question, I know you give out information grudgingly, and I appreciate the disclosure on buyback and your financial disclosures, which I think have been upgraded a lot. I think I remember you saying that you did not want another leg in the energy field, previously that your energy appetite was full. Is that still where you're going? Is there any general area where you might be fishing just services, U.S. domestic versus international, what pond are you...","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Certainly, U.S. based, preferably with a significant portion of the business in the United States, we're looking to write an equity check of somewhere between say $500 million and $1.5 billion. We're looking either truly down and out businesses, but there aren't so many of them today that we're not already invested in. And then the other thing we're looking at is businesses that don't have to worry too much about technological disruption, businesses where hopefully there is opportunity to make additional investments within the industry to grow the business, they don't have to be in any way sexy, they don't have to be high growth, but we're looking for some level of stability.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","That's actually a very good roadmap for me and the investment banking world to help service you. Thank you.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, everyone.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Good morning.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. First question, we see another special dividend from CNA. In terms of board level discussions, how important is the special dividend to the way the business is being run at the board level?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","The board level at CNA or the board level at Loews?","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So I mean, there are some joint people on both boards, so there might be a relationship between those two questions.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","But, are you asking how important is the special dividend for CNA or how important...","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, you said the largest owner of CNA is Loews...","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","I'm aware of that.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And the extent to which that that informs a decision to give a special versus other capital management ideas \u2013 I think that go back about 18 months ago, you said this is a 10% dividend yielding company. Well, it's only a 10% dividend yielding company if that dividend is in perpetuity.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Yeah.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And so, how \u2013 I'm trying to find the board leave discussions about thing, can I intellectually believe that both of these boards look at that dividend in perpetuity?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So, from the Loews' board perspective, Loews is receiving the dividend. And so, our board of directors very much likes receiving that cash. From the CNA perspective, the board has determined that based on its business today, based on its capital structure, based on its credit ratings and a whole lot of other issues that it is capable of paying the special dividend and maintaining its strength. The board at CNA has determined that paying that cash out rather than holding it is in the best interest of the shareholders that at this point in time CNA doesn't have the need for that excess cash and capital.","Now, can I say that that will remain the case permanently? I have no idea. It all depends upon what happens in the world over the next several years. Economically, it depends on what happens to CNA's earnings. It depends upon what happens to other opportunities that CNA may see for itself. All I know is that this year, the board was very happy to declare that dividend, and that no promises are made with respect to the special dividend for next year.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And now, that actually is very clarifying. Thank you. Another President Trump related question, but probably from a different angle. I look at Loews' Hotels...","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","You know, until you said Trump, I don't think we were going to get picked up in those words or just for having a conference call to discuss the new President.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, believe me this thing will be discussed in a way that no other conference calls may ask question about the President I assume. It's about the Trump hotel chain as a competitor to the Loews' Hotel chain.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Okay.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And as you try and grow is \u2013 from what I have read in the press that the Trump hotel chain is looking to grow right now, but it seems \u2013 so there is some complementary strategies between those two hotels in looking for properties in the market. Is that true? And does that \u2013 will it be more difficult for you to find new hotels if you have a small luxury competitor also looking to grow in the same cities you're looking to grow in?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","It's a really, really big world out there, and I would say that to-date, I don't know that we have ever come across or felt we were competing with the Trump hotel brand, and as we look for properties, as we develop properties, we run in for all source of competition, but the Trump brand is not one that we see often.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And, in terms of appetite that you have right now for new properties. If we're looking at a two year plan, how much larger should Loews Hotels be at the end of 2018 than it is at the end of 2016 do you think?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Well, so there are two pieces to Loews Hotels. There is our partnership with Universal in Orlando and that partnership is experiencing very significant growth. If you look what's happened over the past 15 years, we've gone from zero rooms to 4,000 rooms, 5,000 rooms or 6,000 rooms. And in fact, 1,000 room hotel just opened up in Orlando. It's owned by that partnership, opened up in Orlando last year. And the year before that a 1,200 room or 1,800 room hotel opened up.","So in Orlando, there's very significant growth. And that's driven because the demand driver is right there, it's the theme park, and whereas Disney has tens of thousands of hotel rooms. So far the number of Universal Loews rooms, which are on the Universal campus, is measured at 5,000 rooms or 6,000 rooms.","So, as I said, there's room for growth in Orlando. In the rest of the country where we don't have such a large demand driver, then the growth has been and probably will continue to be slower. There we're looking to acquire or develop hotels that are either associated with the demand driver or that have economics of the individual and group business that will give us an attractive return on our investment. So they're two very different parts of the business and together they make up the whole.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","One further question on natural gas. Does the seeming desire of some politicians to rescue the coal industry change the gas outlook?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","I don't think it changes it very much. When I think of natural gas and natural gas demand, the real demand driver in my mind is exports of natural gas, which in the course of the next three or four or five years will go from zero LNG to 10 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas for LNG.","Combined with that, there's Mexican demand, which I think has been increasing demand from the United States. Exports to Mexico have increased about 1 billion cubic feet a year for the past several years and it looks like that's set to continue increasing. That's all on a base of U.S. production of about 71 billion cubic feet per day. So that it's easy to see \u2013 with or without any changes in coal electricity production, it's easy to see that in five years or six years from now, instead of U.S. production being 71 billion cubic feet a day, it could be 80-plus billion cubic feet per day.","And the thing I know about that 80 billion cubic feet of natural gas, it's all going to have to move in a natural gas pipeline. And Boardwalk is working very hard in making its strategic plans so that it can capture as much of that natural gas as possible.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's a very thorough analysis of it. Thank you very much and good luck.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I'll now return the call to Mary Skafidas.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Lorie. We do have a question from one of our shareholders. The question is, it appears that there's considerable room for improvement when it comes to Loews' corporate overhead. The drag on profitability is in excess of $100 million, since most of the assets are publicly traded and have their own overhead, it can be argued that these expenses relate largely to oversight of the non-publicly traded assets. Even if you want to include the subsidiaries, the expense load is significant. Please provide us with some color regarding why the corporate expense level is high and what you are doing to lower this expense base. And again just to remind our callers, we will not be identifying questioners as per their request.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So look we focus a lot on our corporate expenses. I don't think they're exorbitant by any stretch of the imagination. $20 million of the expense relates to RSUs, restricted stock units. We also have the expense of the executives which is fully disclosed in the proxy statement. And again there, I think that if you look at comparable businesses, you'll see that personnel expense, I would think is a bargain. We have an investment department of 30-plus professionals that manages a $50 billion of assets. We have interest on debt. I can tell you that that from my perspective, that expenses are not out of line. I have an expression that goes, sounds good when you say it fast. And when you say it fast, yeah all Loews does is, collect dividends from its subsidiaries and watch over them a bit.","But in fact, there is an awful a lot more that's going on. There is a compliance. There is investments. There is monitoring. There is the proverbial, kicking those tires of looking for new businesses. And I'd say before you have a chance to look up, it adds up to a relatively \u2013 or what may seem like a large amount of money, but those expenses do get very close scrutiny and we're constantly looking to minimize them.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Jim.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","And the problem with asking a question by email is you don't get to follow-up.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Jim.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mary Skafidas, Vice President, Investor and Public Relations. Please go ahead.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Loews Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. A copy of our earnings release, earnings snapshot and company overview may be found on our website, loews.com. On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Edelson. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session.","But before we begin, I would like to remind that this conference call might include statements that are forward looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those projections made in any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made, and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is only a brief summary of the company's statutory forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included in the company's filings with the SEC.","During the call today, we might also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our security filings for a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.","I would now like to turn the call over to Loews' Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch.","James S. Tisch","Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. I trust that you all had a chance to look at our press release, which was distributed earlier this morning. David Edelson, our CFO, will provide details on our earnings later on in the call.","I want to start by discussing today's dividend-related announcements from Diamond Offshore and CNA Financial, and then touch briefly on each of our subsidiaries and the parent company. The rapid decline in oil prices has severely impacted offshore drilling contractors, and we expect this negative impact to continue. Diamond's customers, the national and international oil companies as well as the independent E&P companies, have been scaling back their exploration and development budgets in light of the recent price plunge and their own cash flow shortfalls. Combined with the influx of new offshore drilling units that continue to enter the market, the oil price decline has led to a supply-demand imbalance that has driven down day rates, shortened contract terms and idled rigs.","In view of the decidedly negative conditions in the offshore drilling industry, the Diamond Offshore board has decided not to pay a special dividend this quarter and for the foreseeable future. As Diamond's majority shareholder, we support the board's decision to retain cash so that if opportunities to purchase rigs at attractive prices present themselves, the company is ready to act. Given the company's existing liquidity, its $1.5 billion 5-year revolving credit facility, its modest leverage and its strong credit ratings, we are optimistic that Diamond will be able to capitalize on the current turmoil in the offshore drilling market.","For those of you who tuned into our call -- our last call, you'll remember that with respect to Diamond, I said trouble is opportunity. The trouble is certainly here, and Diamond is prepared for the opportunity.","At CNA, the company's balance sheet has never been stronger, ending the year with statutory capital of over $11 billion and GAAP shareholders' equity of almost $13 billion.","In its most recent writeup on CNA, Standard & Poor's stated that CNA has AAA level capital. As a result of its good earnings and robust capital position, CNA today declared a $2 per share special dividend, which is in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. As a point of reference, last year, CNA paid a $1 per share special dividend. The divergent, completely independent paths of CNA's and Diamond's special dividends highlight the benefit to Loews of maintaining a diverse portfolio of subsidiaries.","The performance of Loews' stock during 2014 was negatively affected by the declines in the stock prices of Boardwalk and Diamond. We took the opportunity during 2014 to buy back almost 4% of our outstanding shares, spending approximately $620 million in the process. While we're certainly not thrilled with the decline in our share price, we believe that, over the long term, buying our stock at attractive levels will prove to have been the right decision.","Similarly, we believe that our purchase during the fourth quarter of 1.9 million shares of Diamond Offshore common stock will benefit our shareholders over the long term as well.","Loews ended the year with $5 billion in cash and investments. One of our perennial priorities is to maintain a strong and liquid balance sheet, which gives us the flexibility to move quickly when opportunity knocks without having to rely on external financing sources.","Now let's take a look at highlights from our subsidiaries. Then I'll turn the call over to David, who will walk you through our quarterly and annual results in greater detail.","Let's start with Diamond. Loews has been in the offshore drilling business for more than 25 years. In that time, we have learned one thing with absolute certainty: offshore drilling is a cyclical business, and Diamond is managed accordingly. 9 years ago when others were paying top dollar for new drilling rigs, Diamond began returning capital to shareholders by paying special dividends. Since January of '06, Diamond has paid over $41 per share in regular and special dividends, returning more than $5.7 billion to shareholders over that time.","We believe that the current market downturn is yet another cycle playing out in offshore drilling and that the industry will eventually recover. It's just a matter of time. While no one knows with any certainty when the market will come back, I'm confident that Diamond will withstand this cyclical downturn as it has others. Diamond has the strongest balance sheet in the business, ample liquidity, moderate leverage and a patient majority shareholder that understands the cyclical nature of the offshore drilling industry.","Turning to CNA. CNA had a strong quarter and year. Its underlying combined ratio improved for the year due to a better business mix as the company continued to focus on industry segments where it has deep expertise, such as technology, financial services and manufacturing. Additionally, CNA benefited from premium rate increases, although such increases slowed somewhat in 2014. For the coming year, CNA will be operating in a market where rate increases are likely to be relatively modest and investment income will be constrained by the interest rate environment. CNA will not stretch for growth, choosing instead to forego growth in return for a more profitable core book of business.","Moving on to Boardwalk. About a year ago, Boardwalk made the difficult decision to reduce its quarterly cash distribution. Fast forward a year and it turned out to be exactly the right decision for the company and for long-term shareholders. Boardwalk has been able to utilize internally generated funds and to take advantage of growth opportunities, avoiding dilution. In fact, almost all of its distributable cash flow has gone towards growth projects or distribution payments. New opportunities for growth continued to materialize in 2014, as Boardwalk secured an impressive $1.5 billion in organic projects to be built over the next 3 to 4 years. While these projects -- when these projects come online, they are expected to generate double-digit, unlevered return for years to come.","And last but not least, let's turn to Loews Hotels. Loews Hotels has been focused on building its brand and broadening its customer base by adding properties in gateway cities and resort destinations as well as by renovating existing properties. The financial performance is showing strong improvement, in part as a result of our capital investment over the past several years. We are enhancing our disclosure regarding Loews Hotels this quarter. David will walk you through the company's adjusted EBITDA during his remarks.","We're excited that Kirk Kinsell has agreed to lead Loews Hotels for the next phase of its growth. He will join Loews Hotels in March. Kirk has tremendous experience in the hospitality industry, having most recently been President of the Americas for InterContinental Hotels Group, where he had responsibility for 3,700 hotels.","Paul Whetsell, who has served as Loews Hotels' CEO for the past 3 years, has done a fantastic job at growing the brand and improving operations. Paul will become Vice Chairman of Loews Hotels once Kirk joins in March.","And coincidentally, Mark's (sic) [Kirk] first day as CEO will also be the first day that the Loews Chicago Hotel will be open for business. Make your reservations now.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to David.","David B. Edelson","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter of 2014, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $215 million or $0.57 per share compared to $248 million or $0.64 per share last year. For full year 2014, income from continuing operations was $962 million or $2.52 per share as compared to $1.1 billion or $2.95 per share in 2013.","Our reduction in parent company investment income drove the quarter-over-quarter decline. For the full year, the main drivers were lower earnings contributions from CNA, Diamond and Boardwalk.","CNA contributed $186 million to Loews' income from continuing operations before realized losses in the fourth quarter of 2014, essentially flat with last year's fourth quarter. Onetime items affected the quarterly results in both years. A CNA pension settlement charge reduced Loews' Q4 2014 income by $49 million, while a charge related to retroactive reinsurance accounting for the Loss Portfolio Transfer transaction reduced our Q4 2013 income by $111 million.","CNA's net investment income in Q4 2014 was down versus the prior year, driven primarily by limited partnership investments. Offsetting positives included higher net favorable prior year development, together with improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophe losses. In Q4 2014, CNA posted slight realized investment losses versus modest gains in the prior year quarter.","For full year 2014, CNA contributed $770 million to Loews' income from continuing operations before realized gains, down from $817 million in 2013. Reduced net investment income and lower net favorable prior year development drove the year-over-year decline. Partially offsetting these declines were improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophes. Onetime items also affected the 2 years.","In 2014, a coinsurance transaction related to the sale of CNA's annuity and pension deposit business reduced CNA's earnings contribution to Loews by $31 million. And in 2013, as just mentioned, the charge related to the Loss Portfolio Transfer, reduced our income by $111 million. CNA posted a higher level of realized investment gains in 2014 than in 2013.","Diamond Offshore contributed $47 million to Loews' income from continuing operations during Q4 2014, up from $44 million last year. Diamond's pretax income was actually down versus prior year. A slight increase in EBITDA was more than offset by higher depreciation and interest expense. Further, in last year's fourth quarter, Diamond's net income was impacted by a high effective tax rate, driven by a provision for an uncertain tax position. This reduced Diamond's after tax contribution to Loews last year by $27 million.","For full year 2014, Diamond contributed $183 million to Loews' net income, down from $257 million in 2013. The company's third quarter 2014 rig impairment charge drove the decline, together with lower rig operating income, higher depreciation and interest expense and higher G&A expenses. Partially offsetting the decline in pretax income was a 4 point reduction in the company's tax rate caused by various factors, including a Q4 2013 tax provision previously mentioned; and in the third quarter of 2014, the benefit to Diamond from settling uncertain tax positions related to several foreign jurisdictions.","Diamond took delivery of 3 drillships and 2 semisubmersibles in 2014. In 2015 and 2016, the company expects to take delivery of the Ocean BlackLion, its fourth new drillship; and the Ocean GreatWhite, its new build, harsh environment semisubmersible. Both of these units are already contracted.","Between its balance sheet liquidity and its $1.5 billion bank revolver, Diamond has ample liquidity for its current capital projects. Additionally, halting the special dividend will enable Diamond to retain, on an annualized basis, over $400 million of cash to bolster its available liquidity.","Boardwalk Pipeline contributed $11 million to Loews' net income during Q4 2014, up from $4 million last year. After adjusting for a goodwill impairment charge in last year's fourth quarter, however, Boardwalk's contribution declined from $20 million last year to this year's $11 million. Boardwalk's fourth quarter 2014 results were negatively impacted by lower storage and park and loan revenue as well as by higher operating expenses.","For full year 2014, Boardwalk contributed $18 million to Loews' net income versus $78 million for 2013. The major onetime items impacting this year-over-year comparison in 2013 were the just mentioned goodwill impairment charge and a partially offsetting gain on the sale of operating gas. The write-off during 2014 of the previously capitalized costs associated with the Bluegrass project reduced Loews' net income by $55 million. Excluding these 3 onetime items, Boardwalk's contribution to our net income declined from $85 million in 2013 to $73 million in 2014.","Loews Hotels generated net income of $3 million during Q4 2014 versus a net loss of $5 million last year. For the full year, Loews Hotels posted net income of $11 million, up meaningfully from a $3 million net loss in 2013. This quarter, we are providing additional information about Loews Hotels, which can be found in the company overview document posted on our IR website.","In particular, I wanted to highlight our disclosure of adjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as the sum of the EBITDA from our wholly owned properties and our pro rata share of the EBITDA generated by our joint venture properties. Management company results are also included. Excluded are nonrecurring items such as transaction costs. The company overview also includes a table that reconciles Loews Hotels reported pretax income to its adjusted EBITDA for the past 3 years. We would be happy to walk you through it offline. And to anticipate a question, we will not be disclosing EBITDA on a property-by-property basis.","For full year 2014, Loews Hotels generated adjusted EBITDA of $123 million, up from $66 million in 2013. The main drivers of the increase were the addition of new hotels, the reopening in January 2014 of the Loews Regency and higher profitability at numerous properties, including our joint venture hotels located at the Universal Orlando Resort.","I would hasten to add that in 2014, several hotels were in the portfolio for only part of the year, including the 1,800-room Cabana Bay Beach Resort, the Loews Minneapolis Hotel and the Loews Chicago O'Hare Hotel. During the 3-year period from 2012 to 2014, Loews Corp.'s net cash contribution to Loews Hotels was $182 million.","In October, we completed the sale of HighMount E&P. The NOL generated by the sale should enable Loews to realize federal tax benefits of approximately $500 million in 2014 and future periods.","Turning to the parent company. After tax investment income during the fourth quarter declined from $54 million to $17 million in 2014, driven by reduced performance from equities and limited partnerships. For the full year, after tax investment income was down from $93 million in 2013 to $63 million in 2014, as favorable year-over-year results in gold-related equities were offset by a decline in year-over-year results for limited partnerships and other equities.","At year end, cash and investments totaled $5.1 billion as compared to $5.2 billion at the end of September and $4.7 billion at the end of 2013. We received $135 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter, which breaks down as follows: $60 million from CNA, $62 million from Diamond and $13 million from Boardwalk. During all of 2014, we received $782 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, up from $736 million in 2013.","As Jim mentioned, today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend. Loews will receive $485 million upon its payment. As a reminder, during the first quarter of 2014, CNA paid a special dividend of $1 per share. Separately, Diamond announced today that it is not declaring a special dividend this quarter and for the foreseeable future. Loews received special dividends totaling $210 million from Diamond during 2014.","As for returning capital to our shareholders, during the fourth quarter, we paid $23 million in cash dividends and spent $207 million buying back 5 million shares of our common stock. We also spent $61 million during the quarter buying 1.9 million shares of Diamond stock, taking our ownership to over 52%.","For all of 2014, we spent $622 million repurchasing 14.6 million shares of Loews common stock or nearly 4% of our shares outstanding. Over the past 5 years, we have bought back almost 13% of our shares.","I will now hand the call back to Jim.","James S. Tisch","Thank you, David. Before we open up the call to questions, we wanted to summarize our focus as we think about our businesses.","For Diamond, the offshore drilling industry is in the throes of a challenging cyclical downturn. We've seen this movie before, and we are encouraging Diamond to use this downturn to seize opportunities to strengthen and expand its business. The U.S. energy markets are experiencing tremendous changes, which have affected Boardwalk. U.S. natural gas and liquids production is forecast to continue growing meaningfully over the coming years. We expect the accompanying growth and demand for transportation and storage will present attractive opportunities for Boardwalk to expand the utilization of its existing network while also extending the network's reach.","CNA enters 2015 laser-focused on improving its underwriting performance. The company's underlying combined ratio continues to decline, but there remains room for improvement as CNA works towards the goal of becoming a top quartile underwriter. We will be keeping a close eye on underwriting profitability especially at CNA Commercial.","And finally, Loews Hotels is welcoming a new CEO and continuing its focus on growth and profitability. As always, we stand ready to help Loews Hotels fund its growth plan.","Overall, there is tremendous change happening across our portfolio of businesses. This coming year will continue to be challenging for some of our subsidiaries, and we are focusing on turning those challenges into opportunities that will benefit our shareholders well into the future. As always, Loews is focused on managing capital to achieve the best long-term return for our shareholders, whether it's through share repurchases, investing in one of our subsidiaries or adding another business to our portfolio. We have found that disciplined capital management, coupled with a diverse portfolio of businesses, is an exceptional way to create value over time.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Jim. This concludes the prepared remarks portion of our call. Lori, I'd like to hand the call back over to you so you can open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Capital.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. Am I right that there was no buyback in 2015 to-date at Loews?","James S. Tisch","We don't answer that question. We'll let our filings speak for themselves.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And in prior quarters, you've put year-to-date -- quarter-to-date purchases on the release, so that seemed to be a change.","James S. Tisch","All right. So you can assume that if there's no quarter-to-date specified on the release, that there weren't any.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. On the Diamond Offshore purchase, I think this is your first purchase of shares from them in a long, long time. What's your buy thesis on increasing your stake? Given that this is a semipermanent acquisition, you're a little bit more careful in how you buy sub-stocks traditionally.","James S. Tisch","So we bought the shares simply because we thought they were very cheap and inexpensive relative to where the stock had been over the past 7 or 8 years and also where it is today in the marketplace. It's our -- I think it reflects our belief that there is a future for the offshore drilling industry.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","What sort of time frame do you think about their fundamental's improving because, clearly, when they're cutting the dividend and the conditions that you described are not robust currently, obviously?","James S. Tisch","Look, I think it can take several years for the offshore drilling industry to improve. My guess is it's still declining. But where stock is priced is oftentimes different than how an industry is behaving. And we just felt comfortable buying shares when we did.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Is there an asset value backdrop to the analysis? Or is it just an earning -- future earnings power in a better world?","James S. Tisch","There have been very few asset transactions in the industry recently other than scrapping of rigs. So it really is quite difficult to say what is the fair market value today for something like a fifth- or sixth-generation rig. So since there have been no transactions, we don't fully know what the asset values, as determined by the market, currently are.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you've been very successful in investing in this arena in the past. Any intelligence that you're able to provide, much appreciated.","James S. Tisch","Yes. Like I said, I think the industry is still declining. I think day rates can continue to go down for a while. Certainly, oil companies are not anxious about drilling now, combined with the fact that there continue to be new rigs that are entering the fleet, rigs that had been ordered 2, 2.5 and 3 years ago. So there is more supply coming on to the market in an environment where oil companies are stepping back. That says to me that day rates can continue to move down. But oil at $40, $50 or, in my opinion, $60 a barrel is not what I would call a steady-state price for oil. I think it has to be -- my guess is it has to be somewhere between $70 and $90 per barrel. And my guess is that, as they say, in the fullness of time, once we get to -- when and if we get to those prices and some stability returns to the oil market, I think that utilization will start to increase. Like I said, I don't know the timing, but I certainly believe that it will happen. The other thing that the oil industry overall has going for it is depletion. The world today produces about 95 million barrels a day of oil. And the estimates are that growth in demand is about 1 million barrels per day every year. So that means that next year instead of demand being 95 million barrels, demand will be 96 million barrels a day. But that doesn't mean that the industry has to find an additional 1 million barrels a day. What it means, in fact, is the industry probably has to find 6 million barrels a day. Because in the course of the year, if no exploration is done, productive capacity worldwide will drop from 95 million to 90 million. So the industry needs to find the 5 million just to make up for what was depleted and then find an additional 1 million barrels of capacity. My sense is that at the price that we have for oil today, we are not replacing all the oil that is depleting. And so my guess is over the next few years, if prices stay down here, we will start to see declines in productive capability.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So Jim, I just wanted to come back to CNA and get your thoughts on the pricing environment across both the commercial and the specialty landscapes. I mean, rates seem to be similar to Q3. Retention was similar to slightly up. You talked about being mindful of profitability. But are you seeing anything that would make you concerned about CNA's ability to fully offset inflation going forward?","James S. Tisch","I think that -- actually, I'm -- I've been fairly sanguine about pricing in the commercial P&C space. And the reason for it is because of the extraordinary capital discipline that has been in place for the past 5 or 10 years in the industry. The industry generates lots of excess capital. And what we see from a lot of companies in the industry is that with the combination of share repurchases and dividends, companies are returning their -- the entire amount of capital that they've earned in the past year. And in fact, some companies are returning more than they're earning. So in the old days, we used to have exaggerated cycles in this industry because companies retained so much capital. But now that, that capital is being recycled through share repurchases and dividends, I just don't see the capacity pressure that drives down prices like we've seen in prior cycles. So prices now, we're still getting probably 2% to 4% price increases. That's generally good enough to cover inflation, which the federal government tells us, is about 1.5%. CNA is also busily re-underwriting its commercial book of business. So I'm hopeful that even in this price environment, over time, CNA can continue to bring down its combined ratio as we strive to become a top quartile commercial lines underwriter.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And as you -- just one other question. As you think about the range of options you have for allocating capital at the parent company level, I'd assume that given the concentration of energy in the portfolio right now, you might prefer to diversify. But at the same time, you repeated this sort of trouble-is-opportunity mantra that I think would probably lead you back to consideration of energy assets right now. So just curious how you balance those conflicting factors and how open you would be to making a material or semi-material allocation of capital back into energy.","James S. Tisch","I would say been there, done that, got the T-shirt. We were in the E&P business, and we have no desire to go back in. We are very happy with our 2 energy subsidiaries, Boardwalk and Diamond. For the most part, they are capable of financing themselves. If for some reason, one or both might need some financing, we would seriously consider it. But those 2 companies, going forward, are going to be our exposure to energy. And in particular, with respect to Boardwalk, it tends not to move on the base -- its business isn't affected based upon the price of the commodity that it's transporting. But unlike Boardwalk, Diamond Offshore, as we all well know, can move dramatically based on the price of oil. So to the extent that the oil market is going to recover, I strongly believe that we will benefit from that through improvements in Diamond's business and hopefully its stock price.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just without being too specific, I suppose, anywhere else in the market that you see that, I guess, a heightened level of opportunity right now?","James S. Tisch","I think the biggest level of opportunity, for those that want to pursue things that are down and out, is the energy market. And we read in the newspapers lots of people who -- lots of people and organizations that are loading their gun, looking to make investments in the energy market. Beyond that, I don't see anything that's as obvious. And I think part of the problem goes back to interest rates. Interest rates are extraordinarily low. With 10-year notes trading below 2% and long bonds trading at 2.5%, there's no doubt in my mind that the -- what the Federal Reserve has done through its quantitative easing is created a squeeze in the long end of the market. There are plenty of investors that need long-dated securities for pension funds and other types of products that they offer. And they just can't get enough of those securities. The Fed owns probably $4 trillion, $3.5 trillion or $4 trillion of long-dated securities. Those are securities that are out of the market. So as a result, there is a squeeze as people clamor for securities that just are not available. So I believe that intermediate to long rates are at manipulated low rates. And the problem with that is that the 10- and 30-year treasury act as benchmarks for all manner of investments in the financial markets and the real estate markets and the capital spending market. So those that are making the decision on either stocks, capital spending or real estate are using a benchmark that, in my opinion, is below its free-market rate. And that's going to cause -- that causes many, many assets to be overpriced compared to where we would think the fair market value of those assets is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Millman of Millman Research Associates.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Some more Diamond questions. Assuming oil is at $80 or $90, what would that suggest should be the drilling rate cost or price, daily rate? And how does that compare with where the market is currently?","James S. Tisch","So it's an interesting question, but I can't give you an exact answer. Because in fact, I can't tell you right now what is the market day rate for, say, a new fifth- or sixth-generation drillship. There haven't been any fixtures recently. My guess is it's between $300,000 and $400,000 a day, but it's really difficult to say. What I would say is that in an environment of oil prices that are, number one, $30 higher than they are today; and number two, where the volatility has -- or much of the volatility has left the oil market, in that environment, I could see that day rates would be higher than they are today. These assets cost about $600 million to build. And in order for someone to buy -- to order a new one, they have to get a return on their investment that makes it worthwhile for them to take that risk. So my guess is that for someone to order a new rig, they would need to anticipate that they could earn, say, $100 million -- at least $100 million on that investment. $100 million is about $250,000 to $300,000 a day that has to be earned. You pile on top of that the daily operating costs of approximately $200,000. And what you see is that before anybody is going to go out and order a new rig, they have to be pretty sure that they're going to be able to earn between $450,000 and $500,000 a day on that asset. And my expectation is that we are not going to be seeing significant new construction for a long time until we do get to that place where pricing is at, what I would call, replacement price levels.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","And so with higher prices required in the future, is it going to be economic for the oil companies to be -- to want to drill at $80 or $90? And sort of related to that, if we look over the next 5 years, there seems to be more movement away from oil. How does that all factor into this?","James S. Tisch","So I think the general agreement by those that study the oil markets, be it the AEI, the IEA or private forecasters, there's general agreement that oil consumption is going to -- worldwide oil consumption is going to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. So I'm not worried about that. And likewise, when we think about -- as I said before, when we think about consumption growing, we have to remember that it's not just 1 million barrels a day of new capacity that you have to add. It's more like 5 million, 6 million or 7 million barrels a day of new capacity that you have to add. So the marketplace, once it reaches an equilibrium, will -- the market price for oil will set to a level that makes it such that enough oil can be found in order to supply the world with what's being demanded. And like I said, my guess is that, that's somewhere between $75 and $90 a barrel. And my guess is that, at those levels, offshore drilling will be very attractive for oil companies.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andy Baker of Barclays.","Andrew Baker","Can you just give us a breakdown of where your corporate cash and investment is -- investments are right now in terms of how much in equity, debt, cash, et cetera?","James S. Tisch","Yes. At year end, we had $250 million to $300 million of equity. We had another $900 million or so of limited partnership investments and the rest was in primarily fixed income or money market instruments.","Andrew Baker","And as you look at that over the course of the year, what leads you to change that? I mean, is it interest rate hikes? How's that going to impact your allocation?","James S. Tisch","So my guess is if the stock market goes down, you'll see us buying more stock. If we spend a significant amount of cash, you might see us reduce our investment in hedge funds. The hedge funds that were invested in for the Loews account are -- there are about 12 or 13 different funds that were invested in. They're all -- those investments were all made with an eye for being able to get our funds back relatively quickly. So to the extent that we were to spend a significant amount of money, we might liquidate some of those investments.","Andrew Baker","Great. And in terms of the equity exposure, I know in the past we've talked -- there were certain times when it was better or worse to be in gold-related stock sometimes. Is there anything now that is particularly appealing? Or are we still large-cap dividend paying, dividend growing type of equities that you think you continue to grow in and can utilize their own capital in a way that can lead to further growth?","James S. Tisch","We have no -- there are no particular sectors that we're looking at right now, nothing that's really caught our fancy.","Operator","Thank you.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mary Skafidas, Vice President of Investor and Public Relations. Please go ahead.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Loews Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of our earnings release and earnings snapshot may be found on our website, loews.com.","On this call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, Peter Keegan. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those projections made in any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made, and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is only a brief summary of the company's statutory forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included in the company's filings with the SEC.","During the call today, we may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our security filings for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.","I will now turn the call over to Loews' Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch.","James S. Tisch","Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. Loews had net income of $282 million or $0.73 per share for the third quarter of 2013 as compared to $177 million or $0.45 per share for the same quarter last year.","Net income for this year's quarter includes an after-tax noncash ceiling test impairment charge of $42 million at HighMount as compared to charges in the third quarter of last year of $166 million. Pete will go into more details on these charges later in the call.","Now let's take a closer look at each of our subsidiaries, starting with CNA. CNA had another strong quarter and continued to improve its underwriting results. Excluding catastrophes and prior year development, CNA posted a loss ratio of 62.8% and a combined ratio of 95.9% in its core P&C operations. This represents almost a 5-point improvement in the combined ratio versus the third quarter of 2012. CNA has been able to accomplish this in 2 ways: First, by taking advantage of favorable rate trends and pushing rate over retention; and second, by actively managing its P&C portfolio, focusing on key segments and exiting segments that don't hold potential for long-term profitability.","Premium rates continue to rise, increasing approximately 7% during the quarter, across P&C operations. Rising interest rates should have a favorable impact on CNA as the company will be able to invest its cash flow at higher yields. CNA continues to take advantage of attractive yield opportunities in the tax exempt and municipal bond markets.","And from the exciting world of accounting, as some of you may have heard on the CNA call, the FASB has proposed a new set of accounting standards for the insurance industry. These proposed rules will make it difficult to compare results for a company from quarter-to-quarter, and they will also make it difficult to compare results from company to company.","Although the common period ended on Friday, I encourage you to learn more about the proposed rules and submit your comments to the FASB. They will be read.","Turning to Diamond Offshore. I want to take a moment to acknowledge Diamond's CEO, Larry Dickerson, who let us know last month that he plans to retire. I've had the pleasure of knowing and working with Larry for the past 25 years. Larry, to whom Diamond has created tremendous value for all shareholders, achieved operational excellence and substantially modernized this space. Part of that modernization program, the Ocean Blackhawk, a newly built ultra-deepwater drillship, and the Ocean Onyx, a newly rebuilt victory-class semisubmersible, are expected to go on day rate in early 2014, followed by the Black Hornet in mid-2014. Diamond expects to take delivery of 2 additional drillships and another rebuilt deepwater semi, the Ocean Apex, in early 2014.","Recently, the Ocean Apex received a letter of intent to begin work for an international oil company in South East Asia during the fourth quarter of 2014.","And lastly on Diamond, due to nonpayment for services by customers OGX and Niko Resources, Diamond recorded a pretax charge of $23 million in the third quarter for revenue it had previously recognized, but had not yet been paid. Likewise, in the third quarter, Diamond did not recognize as revenues $70 million of billings for OGX and Niko.","Now let's move on to Boardwalk. Net income was flat at $19 million. Boardwalk continues to further the company's diversification strategy aimed at making Boardwalk less reliant on transporting and storing natural gas. In May of this year, Boardwalk entered into a joint venture agreement with Williams to continue the development process for the proposed Bluegrass Pipeline. This project would transport natural gas liquids from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays to the rapidly expanding petrochemical and export complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast.","On October 1, as part of the Bluegrass project, Williams and Boardwalk announced that they had executed additional joint venture agreements to continue developing an LPG export facility in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area. The proposed Moss Lake LPG terminal, would serve ships transporting LPG to Asian, Latin American and European markets. Williams and Boardwalk are currently working with a number of parties who want to reserve offtake capacity at the terminals.","As CEO, Stan Horton, discussed earlier today on Boardwalk's earnings call, Williams and Boardwalk are meeting with potential customers about the Bluegrass project, and an open season for the project will begin on October 29. We are hopeful that this significant project will move forward, but we will not know for sure until the first quarter of 2014.","At HighMount, the company's operating results continue to be negatively affected by ongoing lower prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids. HighMount has focused its drilling program on locations that could result in higher oil production such as the Wolfcamp Shale in the Permian Basin in Texas and its acreage in Oklahoma. Both of these programs are in the development stage, and HighMount continues to expand its understanding of both plays.","And finally, at Loews hotels and resorts, 2013 remains a year of transition. Over the past 1.5 years, Loews Hotels has added properties in Boston, Washington and Los Angeles. The company is also developing properties in Orlando and Chicago, and have extensive renovations well underway at a number of hotels, most notably the Regency Hotel in New York, which has been closed since the beginning of the year and will reopen on January 16, 2014.","Loews Hotels recently formed joint ventures through which an institutional investor acquired a 50% interest in the Loews Madison Hotel in Washington D.C., and the Loews Boston Hotel. Both of these properties were acquired in the beginning of 2013.","The company's shared ownership approach to expanding its network of hotels will result in a portfolio mix of wholly-owned joint venture and managed properties. As a holding company, Loews ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.8 billion. We repurchased 900,000 shares of Loews common stock for $41 million during the quarter. During the 9 months ended September 30, we repurchased 4.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $218 million.","As you all have heard by now, we recently announced that Pete Keegan, Loews' CFO for 18 years, will be stepping down in May, and David Edelson, our Senior Vice President of Loews, will succeed Pete. Since we have 2 more earnings calls to go before this transition is complete, we won't embarrass Pete just yet with his living eulogy.","Without any further ado, I'd like to turn the call over to Pete.","Peter W. Keegan","Well, thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income for the 2013 third quarter of $282 million compared to $177 million in the 2012 third quarter.","Net income for the third quarter of 2013 and 2012 includes after-tax noncash impairment charges of $42 million and $166 million at HighMount related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties. Excluding these impairment charges, net income for the third quarter of 2013 and 2012 was $324 million and $343 million.","Net income for the 9 months ended September 30, 2013 was $793 million or $2.03 per share as compared to $600 million or $1.51 per share in the prior year period. Net income for the 9 months ended September 30, 2013, and 2012 includes after-tax noncash ceiling test impairment charges of $134 million and $336 million at HighMount. Excluding these noncash impairment charges, net income for the 9 months ended September 30, 2013, and 2012 was $927 million and $936 million.","CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the third quarter was $247 million as compared to $200 million last year. CNA's earnings increased primarily from improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results and higher favorable net prior year development. These increases were partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and reduced results from the Life & Group segment as a result of unfavorable morbidity in the long-term care business.","Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the third quarter of 2013 was $44 million compared to $83 million in the prior year quarter. Results for the third quarter decreased primarily due to lost revenue and bad debt write-offs totaling $35 million after-tax and noncontrolling interests related to the termination of rig contracts due to payment defaults by 2 of Diamond's customers and lower utilization. These decreases were partially offset by higher day rates.","Boardwalk pipeline's contribution to net income for the third quarter was $19 million as compared to $20 million in the prior year quarter. The contribution of results from Louisiana Midstream, acquired on October 2012, and the sale of storage base gas in 2013 were offset by lower transportation revenues as a result of unfavorable contract renewal conditions. In addition, Boardwalk's contribution to Loews' net income decreased because we own a smaller stake in the company than we did this time last year, 53% ownership in the third quarter as compared to about 59% for the same quarter last year.","On October 9, 2013, we converted all of the 22.9 million Class B units into common units on a 1-for-1 basis. That's an additional $6.3 million in cash distributions per quarter at Boardwalk's current $0.5325 quarterly distribution per unit.","HighMount recorded earnings of $5 million for the third quarter of 2013 compared to $8 million in the third quarter of 2012, excluding noncash ceiling test impairment charges of $42 million and $166 million after taxes for the third quarters of 2013 and 2012.","HighMount's third quarter production volumes and realized prices, which included the benefits of hedges are as follows: Natural gas production was 8.2 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $4.13 per thousand cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 501.4 thousand barrels at an average realized price of $36.06 per barrel; and oil production was 121.2 thousand barrels at an average price of $93.57 per barrel.","HighMount had hedges in place as of September 30, 2013, that covered approximately 74.1% and 44.9% of its total estimated 2013 and 2014 natural gas equivalent production at weighted average prices of $6.48 and $5.56 per Mcfe.","Loews Hotels contributed net income of $1 million for the third quarter of 2013 compared to a loss of $1 million for the third quarter of 2012. Results were impacted by the renovation of the Loews Regency Hotel in New York, which has been closed since early January, partially offset by newly acquired hotels.","Holding company cash investments as of September 30, 2013, totaled $4.8 billion as compared to $4.6 billion at June 30, 2013. We received $183 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the third quarter of 2013 and $547 million in dividends year-to-date.","From CNA, Loews received $48 million in dividends in the third quarter of 2013 and $145 million in dividends year-to-date. From Diamonds, Loews received $61 million in dividends in the third quarter of 2013 and $184 million in dividends year-to-date. From Boardwalk, Loews received $74 million in dividends in the third quarter of 2013 and $218 million in dividends year-to-date.","We paid $24 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the third quarter of 2013 and $73 million year-to-date. We bought back 900,000 shares of Loews common stock for $41 million in the third quarter of 2013 and 4.9 million shares of Loews common stock for $218 million year-to-date.","And that completes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Mary. Mary?","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Pete. Jackie, at this time, we would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First of all, I wonder if you could go onto a little bit of detail on investments,I realize it's not a significant thing, but the volatility, and what we can expect in the future quarters, given the numbers we saw in 3Q relative to prior quarters?","James S. Tisch","I assume you're talking about investments for Loews Corp.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","For Loews Corp. That's right, the coupons.","James S. Tisch","So we have about $4.8 billion of cash and investments. We have about $700 million or so of limited partnership investments that have very good liquidity terms to it, and then we have another $500 million or so of equities. And then beyond that, most of the rest of the other $3.7 billion is invested in money market instruments that do not earn a lot of income.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And the -- and the spike, the $50 million from this quarter in terms of which bucket?","James S. Tisch","Say again?","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The $50 million this quarter goes in which bucket of earnings?","Peter W. Keegan","All equities in LPs.","James S. Tisch","Yes, all equities in LPs.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All LPs. Okay. And also, on the hotels, you got limited partnerships or joint partnerships. Is that the same investor in both hotels, or are those 2 different investors?","James S. Tisch","It's joint venture -- 2 separate joint ventures, but the same investor.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Pete, maybe a question for you. If spot natural gas prices seasonally adjusted in the forward curve, say, ceiling adjusted, or remain more or less where they are today going forward, will there continue to be ceiling test impairment charges over time?","Peter W. Keegan","If prices stayed flat, the answer is probably yes because what happens is in the type of accounting we use is you capitalize all of your drilling costs, and so not everything is successful. So by definition, over time, you'd have to take some of them off. I mean, I'm giving you a very simplistic view of this, but in an unchanged pricing environment, that is probably what would happen.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, Jim, just a question on share repurchases. In a broad sense, leaving out some large-scale acquisition, what drives the outcome from here over the next 12 or 18 months in which 12 or 18 months from now, share repurchases have been very substantial relative to the current run rate versus share repurchases being modest relative to the recent run rate?","James S. Tisch","So there are a few things. Number one, we like to buy the stock at prices that appear low to us on an absolute and relative basis. Number two, we have other calls on our cash beyond simply an acquisition or share repurchases or dividends. So for example, if the Bluegrass project moves forward, chances are that will require significant financing coming from Loews. So that's something that we always keep our eyes attuned to. And finally, if the company is in possession of material nonpublic information, then our legal beagles here do not allow us to repurchase shares. So all those factors going to the mix and make it therefore difficult for investors to discern from our share repurchase in a particular quarter or share repurchases or lack of share repurchases, whether we're bullish or bearish on the stock.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Could you talk about what's the cause of the unfavorable contract renewal conditions at Boardwalk? And I have another question.","James S. Tisch","Sure. Marcellus Shale has turned the pipeline industry on its head. About 3 years ago, there was virtually no gas production in the Marcellus Shale. And today, there's about 11 billion cubic feet of production. That's in the context of the U.S. total production of about -- using the prior numbers, about 66.5 billion cubic feet per day. The Northeast consumes about, on average, 12 billion cubic feet a day. So the system that had been put in place to transport natural gas from Texas, Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico, up to Ohio, Pennsylvania and the Northeast, because of Marcellus' increased production has really -- demand for the transportation to the Northeast has changed dramatically, and that's a major part of what's going on right now.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","So there's pipelines then for Marcellus that are in place but not Boardwalk's.","James S. Tisch","That's right. Plus, if you think of it in terms of the mileage that the average Mcf of natural gas travels, it's dramatically lower because the natural gas is not coming from Texas up to the Northeast, it's coming from Pennsylvania up through the Northeast. And in fact, the reason that Boardwalk is moving forward with the Bluegrass Pipeline project is because it has excess capacity going up to the Northeast. In the Texas gas system, we call it a pipeline, but it really has 3 separate pipes that go from Louisiana up to Ohio. And in the Bluegrass project, we are planning to take one of those pipes that formerly carried natural gas, and instead, we are going to convert it to a pipeline that is capable of carrying natural gas liquids. Those natural gas liquids are currently being produced in the Marcellus Shale and there is very limited capacity to take away those natural gas liquids. So what we're trying to do is get commitments from natural gas and NGL producers to hold their natural gas liquids from the Marcellus Shale down through a combination of new pipelines and our existing pipeline to new processing facilities, fractionation facilities in Louisiana. That's a major effort for Boardwalk. And as I've said in my remarks, we will have a pretty good sense, I believe, in the first quarter of this year -- of 2014, whether or not this project will move forward.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","I see. That was very helpful. Another question. Your -- I guess it's your feelings on investment opportunities given the government shutdown and debt limit crisis that we just experienced.","James S. Tisch","What's my feeling?","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","What's your feeling about wanting to make investments, U.S., international, given those?","James S. Tisch","What's my view? My view on the debt crisis and the government shutdown was that: Number one, I assumed that, eventually, the government would reopen; and number two, I assumed that all interest and principal on the debt would be paid on a timely basis. And that in fact, that whole crisis that we experienced from mid-September to mid-October, while it took up the front pages of the newspaper and took a lot of ink in the investment world, it really wasn't that important in terms of thinking about long-term investing. And the issues that were around before the crisis and after the crisis are really the ones that are the focus -- our focus on deciding when, where and how to invest. Thank you. Let me just say -- one other thing I want to say, I want to add something to my remarks even though there's no question. And that is the issue relating to the FASB and these new accounting rules for insurance companies. They will make it very difficult for investors to be able to understand what's going on within an insurance company and also what's going on within the insurance industry. If these rules get put in place, as proposed by the FASB, it will make it very difficult to compare the numbers from 1 quarter to another quarter within a company, and that's because the reserves are going to be discounted and discount rate is going to change every quarter and can change from one line of business to another line of business. So the measures that we use today to look at our insurance profitability will not be used when as and if these rules are implemented. And likewise, the problem for comparing from one company to another company is that different companies will use different discount rates to compute the present value of their reserves. From my perspective and the perspective of Loews and CNA, the current system that we have in place is tried and true and tested. It is conservative because reserves are not discounted, but the system gives us a very good sense of the profitability of the company, as well as the financial standing of the company. So it's really unclear to us why the FASB wants to tinker with these rules in the first place, but that's what they're doing. Let me turn the call back to Jackie.","Operator","There appear to be no further questions at this time.

A copy of our earnings release may be found on our website, loews.com.","On this call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, Peter Keegan. Following their prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward looking in nature.

Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made, and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.

Please refer to our security filings for a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.","I will now turn the call over to Loews' Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch.","James S. Tisch","Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. Loews had net income of $242 million, or $0.62 per share, for the first quarter of 2013 as compared to $367 million, or $0.92 per share, for the same quarter last year.","Results for the quarter were impacted by an after-tax ceiling test impairment charge at HighMount of $92 million as compared to an impairment charge of $28 million in the prior year. After these charges, which Pete will describe in more detail later in the call, our net income for the quarter would have been $334 million, or $0.85 per share, in 2013 as compared to $395 million, or $0.99 per share, in the first quarter of 2012. The decrease in net income for the quarter was due to reduced investment income at Loews and slightly lower earnings at Diamond.","Let's take a closer look at a result and progress of each of our subsidiaries, starting with CNA. CNA had a good quarter and continued to improve its underwriting performance through risk selection and pricing discipline while generating premium growth. Excluding catastrophes and prior year development, CNA saw continued improvement in the P&C combined ratio, with a year-over-year decrease of just over 1 point and a 2.2-point improvement over the last quarter. Overall, net premium growth for the company's core P&C operations exceeded 10%. Rate increases contributed to this premium growth, averaging 7.7% across P&C operations for the quarter as contrasted to 4% during the first quarter of 2012.","The inclusion of Hardy in the first quarter contributed approximately 3 points of CNA's 10% premium growth. While we are pleased with CNA's growth momentum, we expect CNA to remain focused on improving its underwriting margin. As you have heard on recent CNA calls, this margin improvement is expected to come from rate increases, writing profitable new business in target segments, and cycling off of inadequately priced business.","I also want to touch on CNA's investment portfolio. Loews provides investment management services to CNA through our in-house investment management group. Our priorities in managing our CNA portfolio are to protect principal, maintain ample liquidity, employ prudent asset liability management and generate strong and risk-adjusted returns. CNA's investment portfolio had a market value of $47.6 billion at the end of the quarter. The vast majority of the portfolio is in investment-grade fixed-income securities.","To improve our overall returns, about 5% of the portfolio is allocated to a diverse mix of limited partnerships. This allocation provides CNA with attractive equity-like returns with less volatility than the overall equity market. Over the past 15 years, this portfolio has had an annualized total return of 11%.","In the first quarter of 2013, LP investments returned 5.4%, double the historic rate of return. In this current interest rate environment, we have slightly increased our allocation to these alternative investments. We are very comfortable with the mix and quality of CNA's portfolio but frustrated that overall interest rates are so low.","At Diamond Offshore, this quarter was a relatively quite one. Revenues and net income were down versus the prior year, primarily due to an increase in planned downtime for special surveys. These surveys are required for rigs every 5 years, and it just so happens that 2013 is the year in which the fleet has a large number of surveys. Fewer special surveys are scheduled for 2014 and 2015.","Demand in the offshore drilling market continues to be very strong, with oil prices remaining at a level that supports robust drilling activity across all water depths, particularly in the ultra-deepwater market. This market's strength is reflected in Diamond's total revenue backlog, which, as of April 25, was $8 billion, with contracts extending into 2019.","Diamond has 2 new rigs going on day rate this year. The rebuilt Ocean Onyx is scheduled for delivery from the shipyard late in the third quarter and will go on day rate shortly thereafter. The Ocean BlackHawk, the first of Diamond's 4 new drillships, is scheduled to be delivered midyear and go on day rate in December after moving to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.","At Boardwalk, we had another good quarter, driven by the strength of their latest acquisition, Louisiana Midstream. Boardwalk continues to be an excellent investment for Loews. Since '03 when we acquired Texas Gas Transmission, our first pipeline, Loews has invested a total of $3.2 billion in Boardwalk. We have received all of our cash back while still owning 53% of the limited partnership interest, which is worth approximately $3.6 billion, as well as 100% of the general partner.","On March 6, Boardwalk announced its latest proposed project, the Bluegrass Pipeline, to be built in partnership with the Williams Company. This pipeline, which would use a portion of the existing Texas Gas pipeline, would transport national gas liquids produced in the Marcellus and Utica Shales to new fractionation and storage facilities in Louisiana, home of the petrochemical industry. At this point in the process, Boardwalk is performing cost assessments and due diligence, as well as negotiating terms of the joint venture and related agreements with Williams.","As CEO Stan Horton mentioned on Boardwalk's call this morning, there are a number of conditions that must be met for this project to be approved, including negotiating a definitive joint venture agreement, execution of customer contracts sufficient to support the project, receipt of regulatory approval and approval of both the Boardwalk and Williams boards.","HighMount's operating results continued to be negatively affected by ongoing low prices for natural gas. As a result, HighMount has redirected its drilling efforts to locations that should result in higher oil productions, such as its acreage in the eastern portion of the Mississippian Lime in Oklahoma and the Wolfcamp Shale in the Permian Basin in Texas. In both of these areas, oil and natural gas liquids can make up 70% to 80% of the hydrocarbons produced from a well.","HighMount continues to improve its understanding of both plays. They are working to determine optimal drilling and completion techniques for each area, as well as to identify reservoir characteristics. The drilling programs in both plays involve an extensive inventory of drilling locations. In the Miss Lime, primarily horizontal drilling will be used. In the Wolfcamp, both horizontal and vertical well designs are being tested and considered. Both of these programs are in the early development stage. And although success cannot be guaranteed, we are hopeful.","And finally, some comments on Loews Hotels & Resorts. This is a transition year for Loews Hotels, which has the twin goals of, one, broadening its customer base by adding properties in gateway cities; and two, improving the profitability of its existing properties. There is substantial progress towards these goals, but you will not see that progress reflected in quarterly earnings during 2013.","In the past year, Loews Hotels has added properties in Boston, Washington and Los Angeles. Overall, revenues and income are being negatively impacted, however, by the existing renovations at a number of our hotels, most notably, the Loews Regency in New York, which has been closed since January, as well as our properties in Nashville, Hollywood and Philadelphia. We believe the actions taken by Loews Hotels in 2013 will position our change for growth and enhance profitability in the years to come.","At the holding company, Loews ended the quarter with net cash and investments of $3.7 billion. We repurchased 2.1 million shares of Loews common stock for $92 million during the quarter. We continued to repurchase shares after the quarter ended. And year-to-date through April 26, we've repurchased a total of 3.2 million shares of Loews common stock for $141 million.","As many as you on the call know, although we do not broadcast our share repurchase plans, we have historically been prolific buyers of our own stock. Since 2010, we have spent about $1.5 billion repurchasing Loews common stock. Share repurchases have been an important part of our effort to build long-term value for Loews shareholder. As we've said before, we repurchase our shares at prices below our view of intrinsic value not to offset stock option issuance, but with the intent of enhancing the long-term value of Loews common stock. Our strong belief is that share repurchases have greatly contributed to the outperformance of our stock versus the S&P 500 over the long term.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Pete Keegan.","Peter W. Keegan","Well, thanks, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $242 million, or $0.62 per share, for the first quarter 2013 as common $367 million, or $0.92 per share, for the first quarter of 2012. As Jim mentioned, net income in the first quarter includes an after-tax ceiling test impairment charge at HighMount of $92 million related to its carrying value of natural gas and oil properties as compared to an impairment charge of $28 million for the prior year quarter.","Excluding the noncash ceiling test impairment charges, the decrease in Loews' net income is due to slightly lower earnings at Diamond and reduced investment income at the parent company. Investment income decreased by $45 million after tax, primarily due to lower performance of equity-based investments, partially offset by improved performance of fixed-income investments in the trading portfolio.","CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the first quarter was $226 million, which was also its contribution in the first quarter 2012. Earnings were consistent with prior year, primarily due to improved current year non-catastrophe underwriting results, offset by lower investment income, higher catastrophe losses, including non-cat-related weather losses, and a slight decrease in net favorable prior year developments.","Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the first quarter 2013 was $82 million compared to $87 million in the prior year quarter. Results for the first quarter were impacted by lower utilization, primarily from an increase in planned downtime due to scheduled rigs surveys, which resulted in fewer revenue-earning days for the quarter. The Ocean Whittington and the Ocean Ambassador are currently stacked, while both were working in 2012. In addition, the prior year quarter concluded the sale of the jack-up rig Ocean Colombia, resulting in an after-tax gain of approximately $16 million.","Diamond's effective tax rate decreased for the 3 months ended March 31, 2013, as compared with 2012. The lower effective tax rate in the current quarter is primarily a result of the extension of several expired or expiring temporary business provisions, which are retroactively extended at the beginning of 2012 under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was signed into law on January 2, 2013. One of the extenders will again allow Diamond Offshore to defer recognition of certain foreign earnings to U.S. tax purposes.","Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the first quarter was $33 million as compared to $35 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in Boardwalk's contribution to Loews' net income is simply because we own a slightly smaller stake in the company than we did this time last year, 55% ownership currently as compared to about 62% for the same quarter last year. Boardwalk's operating revenues increased due to the acquisition of Louisiana Midstream, which contributed $19 million in net revenues for the quarter. This revenue increase was partly offset by lower revenues associated with firm contract renewals.","HighMount recorded a net loss of $88 million for the first quarter of 2013 compared to a net loss of $22 million in the first quarter of 2012. As we stated earlier, the lower results were due to a noncash cost-centered ceiling test impairment charge of $92 million after taxes. The 2013 write-down was attributable to reduced average NGL and oil prices used in the the ceiling test calculation and negative reserve revisions.","HighMount's first quarter production volumes and realized prices, which included the benefits of hedges, are as follows: Natural gas production was 8.6 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $4.10 per 1,000 cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 503,000 barrels at an average realized price of $37.33 per barrel; and oil production was 158,000 barrels at an average price of $90.60 per barrel.","HighMount had hedges in place as of March 31, 2013, that covered approximately 64.6% and 32.3% of its total estimated 2013 and 2014 natural gas equivalent production at an average weighted -- at a weighted average price of $6.48 and $5.89 per Mcfe.","Loews Hotels operated on a breakeven basis for the first quarter of 2013 as compared to net income of $4 million for the first quarter of 2012. Results were primarily due to the Loews Regency Hotel in New York, which will be closed for the majority of the year for extensive renovations, and the sale of the Loews Denver Hotel in the fourth quarter of 2012, partially offset by the additions of hotels in Washington, D.C. and Boston.","Holding company cash and investments as of March 31, 2013, totaled $3.7 billion as compared to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2012. We received $182 million in dividends from our subsidiaries. $48 million from CNA, $62 million from Diamond and $72 million from Boardwalk. We paid $24 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the first quarter of 2013 and bought back 2.1 million shares of Loews common stock for $92 million. As Jim mentioned, we continued to repurchase shares after the quarter ended. And through April 26, we repurchased a total of 3.2 million shares of Loews common stock for $141 million.","And now I'll turn the call back over to Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Pete. Jackie, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","I actually have 2 questions, one is with Boardwalk. What kind of risk is there in terms of the buyers contracts or some of the contracts failing in some way? And second is more broadly, now that the market has continued to go up, are acquisitions even looking less positive to you than they might have a couple of years ago?","James S. Tisch","Well, first of all, with respect to risk at Boardwalk, tell me specifically what you're referring to?","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Well, I'm referring to that there are contracts out there and I don't know if something goes wrong with the supplier, the field blows up or if the buyer -- if bankruptcy -- what kind of protection...","James S. Tisch","So historically, we have -- credit quality has not been a problem for us at Boardwalk, that all of our customers have generally paid on time and that has not been an issue for us. So it's something we tend not to worry about too much. In terms of acquisitions, we keep looking, we keep kicking tires. You're right, equity values have gone up, but interest rates are still very low. And we haven't given up in our quest to look for something and find something that fits us and is just right for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Pete, you went through the role of the cash too quickly for me. It looked like your dividends were $70 million more than buyback plus dividends paid, but your cash went down by $200 million. Was there a debt payment or something else in there?","Peter W. Keegan","No, we are contributing money to hotels to help on their growth plan. So we've added a bunch of hotels there.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. I haven't seen the Q if it's come out yet. What's your investment in hotels now? Do you have a figure from some of the parts?","Peter W. Keegan","I don't have that readily available.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","So I'd assume the difference in the data mix is...","Peter W. Keegan","[indiscernible] and a small amount into HighMount in the quarter.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","I'm sorry?","James S. Tisch","And a small amount into the HighMount in the quarter.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. You said you had -- the impairment charge was driven by lower oil prices, did you say, and lower reserves?","Peter W. Keegan","Keep in mind, this is a 4-quarter look back of the prices. In the first quarter, natural gas prices actually went up slightly, and NGL and oil prices went down. And it's that in combination with the calculation of reserves and production. This is a very complicated calculation, which drove that impairment.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. If we just -- if we freeze prices where they are today, are there more impairments coming? Or are we through the -- is there light at the end of the tunnel and there's -- I mean, if we freeze everything today...","Peter W. Keegan","Well, if you freeze prices, it's hard to say because the other part of calculation is reserves and production. So it's really hard to...","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. Well, you made your best guess on reserves and production today, right, so that shouldn't wiggle if we freeze that?","Peter W. Keegan","Yes. But in the accounting, keep in mind, we capitalize all of our spending. So you're constantly increasing the base against which this is calculated.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. Can you remind me what the Boardwalk general partnership dividends are running in quarter or what they were last year?","James S. Tisch","Yes, I have that here. For the general partners, we received about $10 million a quarter.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. And we're in the maximum phase, right, of the earn...","Peter W. Keegan","They're 50%.","James S. Tisch","The high split, yes.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","We're in the high split so -- I mean, it's now just going to grow with their overall dividends, right? There's not a step to that, there's not an accelerator?","Peter W. Keegan","There's not another step function in the split, no. That's the highest level it goes to.","James S. Tisch","The only split beyond 50% is everything, and I don't think we're ever going to get there.","Peter W. Keegan","That isn't part of the formula.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Right. Is there an endgame on -- I mean, is Boardwalk one of these like Buffet, we're going to own it forever, we love it. Is there a way you could capitalize that...","James S. Tisch","Bob, we love all of our children, and we're very positive about all of them. And we don't think about disposing of any of them.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. I'm just saying you've got sort of -- in your sum of the parts, you used to sort of like try to value the pieces. Now we're sort of left to our own, and so we've got a $40 million growing annual earnings power that...","James S. Tisch","You mean in the GP?","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Right.","James S. Tisch","Okay.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","I'm just trying to think of how we should think of that as an asset, a growing $40 million dividend base annually. You're not going to give me any help to think about it or how to think about it?","James S. Tisch","No, sorry.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay, so left to my own volition, I'll take a stab at it, but your insights on that would be appreciated, as always.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jim, can you enlighten us a little bit about the lower investment income from equity performance, given the backdrops that the S&P did quite well in the first quarter?","James S. Tisch","Yes, we had some investments in bread-and-butter S&P 500 stocks, but we also have some investments in gold and mining shares. And those penalized the total returns for the quarter.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then in the discussion, Pete, with the potential prospects of additional impairment through the remainder of the year, I think last year after the first quarter, you indicated sort of what it would likely be the remainder of the year. Is there a reason you're not doing that now for the rest of the year?","Peter W. Keegan","Yes, the reason we could do it last year is there was a clear trend of pricing, David, and so we knew what was coming because of the way you calculate this thing or at least you could get within a reasonable range of what was coming. Where prices are right now and when you're at the ceiling, it's really very hard as you look forward to predict what's going to move things. We might have 0 points. So your guess is as good as mine as to what you think is going to happen to pricing in the next quarter.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then one other question and the last question for me on HighMount. Can you help us sort of understand, particularly with the effort to go after natural gas liquids and oil, both -- what's the incremental return on investment you think you'll be able to generate? And secondly, what's the scale of the potential opportunity? In other words, what can the ongoing cash flow get towards in the current commodity environment?","James S. Tisch","So for both the Mississippian Lime and also Sonora, the cash flow right now is driven primarily by gas prices. And as you've heard me say, I don't think that gas prices are going to increase significantly from here. I think between $4 and $5 for natural gas, we are at what I would call an equilibrium price, where there's a lot of production that can come on, assuming that there's demand for the natural gas. However, with respect to oil and NGLs, it's a completely different story. In both the Mississippian Lime and especially in Sonora, we have relatively few oil and NGL wells. We're doing a -- what I would call a major science experiment in both places, trying to -- we know that there are hydrocarbons on our properties, and we can produce them. And now we are trying to figure out how to produce them commercially and economically. And if we do figure out how to do that, and I'm hopeful that we will over the next few years, then there will be significant investment opportunities for us to invest in development wells on these properties. So you asked about cash flow. My guess is that there won't be significant operating cash flow from those properties for the next several years because we're going to have to invest in the oil and NGL wells that will produce the gas -- the cash flow from those properties. But that over time, if we embark on this investment program, if we're able to figure out how to produce from these areas commercially, then there could be a significant cash flow from the property.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andy Baker with Barclays.","Andrew Baker","A couple of questions. One, just want to make sure I haven't missed something along the way, the Boardwalk pipeline Class B shares, I believe they are convertible after June 30 of this year and they move up to the sort of full dividend receipt. So that's before the next time we'll hear from you guys. I just want to see if that's something you actually intend to do to convert those at that time.","James S. Tisch","Yes, we do.","Andrew Baker","Okay, great. And then, Jim, just sort of bigger picture-wise, we've talked in the past about how the industrial economy, in general, could look to convert over towards natural gas and, over time, significantly increase the demand side of that equation. I think we haven't discussed this really in about 6 months. Any sort of anecdotal evidence you're seeing that those people who could perhaps make the transition are making progress in that regard?","James S. Tisch","It almost sounds like the shale question. I landed in Houston -- no, sorry, I landed in New Orleans for some meetings that I had there, and I was -- as I was getting into the car, the driver opened -- popped open the trunk of the car, and I was just about to throw my bags in, and there I saw what look like a big scuba tank and it said, \"propane.\" And so I asked the driver about it. And in fact, that was a propane-fueled automobile. Now I don't think that growth in natural gas liquids is going to come from Lincoln Town Cars running on propane gas. But if you read the trade press, you can see that there's a lot of talks about LNG for trucks and as well for locomotives. And my guess is that's where the growth is going to come from, as well as from inner-city delivery trucks that work the streets during the day and come back to a garage at night. So I'm a believer that we're going to see significant increases in demand for our natural gas. And I also think that significant demand increase is going to come from the exportation of natural gas, which should begin in the next 2, 3 or 4 years.","Andrew Baker","Just one other thing, with interest rates moving down to the lows here again, just wondering what your sort of thought is on interest rate movement going forward and how that could potentially impact your investments, particularly on the credit side?","James S. Tisch","I think interest rates, as I said in my comments, are very low. We're frustrated by how low they are. We'd like them to go higher. We are -- for CNA, we maintain a -- for our non-matched accounts, which represents about 2\/3 of the assets at CNA, we maintain a duration of under 5 for the portfolio. And what we're doing is we're basically investing new cash flow in 10-year securities. And as they roll down the yield curve over time, we picked up a pretty good rate of return on those investments. But investing in -- with that type of strategy is truly a kiss-your-sister type of strategy. There's nothing at all exciting about it, and what we'd really like to see is higher interest rates. I think that a lot of the price increases that we're able to see -- that we're seeing now in the insurance market are the -- is the result of such low interest rates. So what the legacy assets are running off, the companies need to earn a rate of return on their capital. And since they can't get it from their investing operations, they have to get it from their underwriting operations. And so I think we're seeing that in clear view now.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Mary Skafidas for any closing remarks.","Mary Skafidas","Great. Thank you, Jackie, and thank you, all, for your continued interest in Loews.

Please go ahead.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Loews Corporation's first quarter earnings conference call. A copy of our earnings release, earnings supplement and company overview may be found on our website, loews.com. On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Edelson. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward-looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those made or implied in any forward-looking statements due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.","This disclaimer is only a brief summary of the company's statutory forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included in the company's filings with the SEC. During the call today, we might also use non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our Security filings and earnings supplement for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.","In a few minutes, our CFO, David Edelson, will walk you through the key drivers for the quarter. But before he does, Jim Tisch, our CEO, will kick off the call. Jim, over to you.","James Tisch","Thank you, Mary. Loews had a solid first quarter, but before I get into any specifics about our earnings, I want to mention something that those of you who listened to Boardwalk's call this morning will have already heard. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently announced a policy change that eliminates an MLP's ability to include an income tax allowance in determining the maximum applicable rates it is allowed to charge customers on its interstate pipelines. The recent tax reform legislation, coupled with FERC's subsequent actions, have sparked a review as to whether Boardwalk should remain a publicly traded master limited partnership. It appears that FERC's action would materially decrease the maximum applicable rates Boardwalk could charge in the future.","The effect on max rates may result in Loews being able to exercise a call right under the terms of the Boardwalk partnership agreement. Those terms allow Loews to purchase Boardwalk's outstanding LP units at a formula price. The formula price would be based on the average of the daily closing prices of Boardwalk's common units for a 180-day period prior to the day when and if we exercise our purchase right. This purchase right is further described both in our 10-Q and Boardwalk's 10-Q as well as in Boardwalk's past SEC filings. It is also discussed in Loews' amended Form 13D, which will be filed later today.","We at Loews are exploring all our options regarding these developments. Although we expect to be able to make a decision sometime this year, no decisions have yet been made. As you can imagine, we'll have to let our documents speak for themselves since we are constrained from answering any questions on this topic. Luckily, we have other subsidiaries and capital allocation actions that we can discuss. In particular, the earnings for CNA and Loews Hotels have been impressive, so I'd like to give you some color on what's happening in each of these companies.","CNA had another phenomenal quarter, delivering a combined ratio of 93.1%, the lowest quarterly underlying combined ratio it's had in over a decade. While the recent tax cuts contributed to its quarterly performance, CNA's substantial earnings increase was primarily due to the strength of its underwriting results. For the quarter, CNA had a pretax underwriting gain of $113 million versus $43 million in the corresponding quarter last year, and adjusted net written premium likewise grew 8%. The company's growth was driven by rate, exposure change and a strong increase in new business as CNA continues to make great strides with its distribution network.","While pleased with the strong results, CNA remains committed to further improving its underwriting performance, continuing to strengthen relationships with distributors and diligently managing its expense ratio. Loews and CNA both feel that the company is poised for ongoing responsible growth. And speaking of ongoing responsible growth, Loews Hotels also had a terrific quarter and is off to a great start for the year. A stronger-than-usual tourism market in Florida benefited our recently renovated Loews Miami Beach Hotel. Additionally, in Orlando, our joint venture properties with Universal Studios continued to perform remarkably well.","Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA was up 30% from last year's first quarter, and this growth was not based solely on the hotel chain's expansion but also on the strong performance of its existing properties. Same-store RevPAR also grew 8% from $188 in last year's first quarter to $203 during the first quarter of 2018.","Loews Hotels continues to concentrate on highly profitable, distinguished hotels in the upper upscale market that cater to group business. The company also seeks out properties that have partners who bring with them unique built-in demand generators as it has done so successfully in its long-term partnership at the Universal Orlando resort. The company's flexibility, its agile operating philosophy and its willingness and ability to invest in its own projects all represent competitive advantages. We're confident in this strategy and Loews Hotels' leadership and in the company's ability to create value for our shareholders over the long term. Before I turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson, I want to talk about share repurchases. Over the past 7 months, Loews has repurchased approximately 18.6 million shares or about 5.5% of our outstanding shares at a cost -- at a total cost of almost $1 billion. These buybacks reflect our confidence in our underlying businesses. It's safe to say that share repurchases remain one of our major capital allocation levers for creating long-term value for our shareholders.","David, over to you.","David Edelson","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $293 million or $0.89 per share compared to $295 million or $0.87 per share in last year's first quarter. Average shares outstanding declined 3% year-over-year, resulting in higher earnings per share despite a slight reduction in net income.","Now let me walk through the ins and outs of the quarter. I will start with CNA, which contributed almost 90% of our net income this quarter and accounted for the biggest year-over-year positive earnings variance. CNA contributed net income of $261 million, up 12% from the first quarter of 2017. There were two main drivers of the increase, improved underwriting income and higher after-tax investment income. CNA posted outstanding P&C underwriting results in the quarter. This strength was broad-based and spanned all 3 P&C segments, commercial, specialty and international.","While CNA once again experienced favorable prior year development, its underwriting results in Q1 2018 were robust even before prior year development and catastrophe losses. During the first quarter, CNA's P&C combined ratio was 93.1 and its underlying combined ratio, which excludes prior year development and catastrophe losses, was almost identical at 93.2. Both represented over 4 points of improvement versus last year's first quarter.","Let me highlight CNA's loss ratio, which is a component of its combined ratio. CNA posted an underlying loss ratio of 60 in Q1, an improvement of more than 2 points from last year's first quarter and 1 point better than full year 2017. CNA's loss ratio shows real improvement and compares favorably to peers. The meaningful decline in CNA's combined ratio led to a significant increase in the company's P&C underwriting income, which climbed more than 160% pretax and even more after-tax given the lower corporate tax rate.","Net investment income was lower year-over-year on a pretax basis due entirely to LP income, but the reduced corporate tax rate resulted in an increase in after-tax net investment income. Despite the year-over-year decline in LP income, CNA's LP portfolio returned a respectable 1.2% in a quarter during which the S&P 500 returned negative 1.2%.","Before leaving CNA, I will note that CNA completed its review of its asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities in the first quarter and booked a noneconomic retroactive reinsurance charge related to the 2010 loss portfolio transfer. This charge, which is essentially a deferred gain, reduced CNA's contribution to our net income by $28 million this year and by $12 million last year. Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore made a $10 million positive contribution to our net income in the first quarter despite a $25 million pretax loss. The pretax loss was an outgrowth of the continuing difficult conditions in the global offshore drilling market. Diamond experienced a 21% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues caused by a similar decline in revenue earning days.","The swing from a pretax loss to positive net income was caused by a tax benefit as Diamond reversed an uncertain tax position it had booked in Q4 2017 related to the deemed repatriation of previously deferred non-U.S. earnings. Further guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury and the IRS in the first quarter clarified certain provisions in the Tax Act, permitting Diamond to reverse its liability for this uncertain tax position. Boardwalk's net income contribution was essentially flat year-over-year despite a decline in pretax income. The reduction in pretax income was precipitated by a 5% decline in net revenues as incremental revenues from growth projects recently placed into service and the benefits of colder weather did not make up for the near-term negative revenue impact of the previously announced restructuring of existing firm transportation agreements with Southwestern Energy as well as a decline in storage and parking and lending revenues caused by unfavorable market conditions.","The lower corporate tax rate booked at the Loews level resulted in Boardwalk's after-tax earnings being almost flat with the prior year. Moving on to Loews Hotels. As Jim mentioned, Loews Hotels posted excellent results in Q1 as many of its properties, including Loews Miami Beach Hotel and the properties at the Universal Orlando Resort, posted strong operational and financial results.","Loews Hotels contributed net income of $13 million, up from $10 million in Q1 2017. The quarterly comparison looks even better once last year's results are adjusted for the $10 million pretax, $6 million after-tax net gain attributable to the sale of a JV property and the write-down of another JV property. Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary available on our IR website, was $57 million in the quarter, up $13 million from last year's first quarter.","Turning to the parent company. Pretax and after-tax investment income were down from an exceptionally strong quarter in Q1 2017 with lower returns on equities and LP investments driving the year-to-year decline. The bulk of the portfolio continues to be invested in cash and equivalents. The Corporate and other segment improved $10 million on a pretax basis for two main reasons, the absence of transaction-related expenses incurred in 2017 in connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Container and income generated by Consolidated Container in the first quarter of 2018.","The parent company balance sheet continues to be extremely strong and liquid. At March 31, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled just under $4.9 billion, was slightly more than 50% in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments. We received $571 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the first quarter; $558 million from CNA, which includes the $0.30 regular quarterly dividend and the $2 special dividend; and $13 million from Boardwalk.","We repurchased 9.9 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter for a total of $497 million. After quarter end, we've purchased an additional 4-plus million shares for a total of $207 million. Taken together, we have repurchased over 4% of our shares outstanding since year-end 2017.","I will now hand the call back to Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, David. Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I'd like to reiterate that Loews is constrained from answering any questions related to the call right under the Boardwalk partnership agreement. For additional information on this topic, please refer to Loews SEC documents that will be filed later today.","Now I will hand the call over to Maria to open up the call for questions. Maria, over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel of Janney.","Robert Glasspiegel","Is there any takeaways from this Boardwalk to how we should think about the CNA and Diamond Offshore minority positions or majority positions that you have? And -- or is this just a mechanical fallout of FERC rules that is driving the process and has nothing to do with maximizing intrinsic value to Loews?","James Tisch","So, no, neither Diamond nor CNA have anything resembling this right that we have at Boardwalk.","Robert Glasspiegel","I'm sorry, I was asking a different question. We're not allowed to ask about Boardwalk, so I'm just trying to flip it around a little bit. It sounds like the Boardwalk decision was driven by this MLP rule change, but I'm trying to -- was there any sort of maximizing value to Loews in the thought process that might...","James Tisch","Bob, I said in my comment that no decision has been made. So no decision has been made. And as for the rest of your question, I really have to let our filings speak for themselves. They run multiple pages. They are very informative and they should be able to answer all the questions you have.","Robert Glasspiegel","No, they're very helpful. Getting fully inside your head is still not possible completely from the disclosure, but I appreciate your answer. One bookkeeping question. Your Page 4 of your slides where you say parent debt is $1.8 billion. And in Page 15 you have long-term debt of $2,361,000,000 under Corporate. What's the difference between those 2 numbers?","David Edelson","I believe the difference is Consolidated Container, which is in the Corporate and other segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker","So the share repurchase has been going rather aggressively recently. How do you weigh share repurchase from operational cash flow versus perhaps increasing the leverage at the company through debt issuance given where we are in the interest rate cycle?","James Tisch","So what I'd say is that, right now, we have no need to issue additional debt. As David said, at the end of the quarter, we have 4 point -- just about $4.9 billion of cash and investments at the holding company level. And from my perspective, that's plenty of capital to do what we want to do.","Joshua Shanker","Okay. And on the hotels, can you talk about the difference in revenues and profits from a hotel that's under renovation, [indiscernible] Miami, versus coming out of renovation? What happens to the income statement of a hotel going through that transition?","James Tisch","Well, in the case of the Miami Beach Hotel, it wasn't closed down, but there were very, very few guests there because it was a major construction site. So we went from very, very little revenues and negative income to very strong income now that the hotel is fully back.","David Edelson","For example, when it was under -- occupancy is down and rate is down. And for example, group business doesn't come to a property under that level of renovation.","Joshua Shanker","And so my question, I guess, comes -- how much of the profitability and revenue success at the hotel segment now is year-over-year the difference of Miami being off -- being partially off-line to being at full throttle right now?","David Edelson","In terms of the uptick in income, how much of it is solely attributable to Miami?","Joshua Shanker","Or I mean, I know you won't get -- you can talk about it in general terms. I know you don't talk specific number per hotel, but yes, how much of the change is really Miami-related in the qualitative sense, I guess?","James Tisch","Yes, there was a lot going on and the hotel had, I think, just come back in the first quarter. And additionally, Miami and Florida tourism was affected by Zika last year and that hasn't been an issue this year. So I don't have the specific numbers for the hotel, but there was a significant increase in EBITDA margin that came from those hotels this year compared to last year.","David Edelson","It was no means the entire uplift. The uplift in income was attributable to Miami for sure, but also Orlando and other properties.","Joshua Shanker","And with Loews San Francisco, that property, is that fully online? Or are there renovations to be done there?","James Tisch","There were some minor renovations being done, but that's it. It's fully online.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Millman of Millman Research.","Michael Millman","Could you update us on your thinking of the impact of the Tax Act now that you've had a chance to study it some more? I mean, I suppose in some ways what you talked about with Boardwalk has an impact, but outside of that, in terms of what you might want to hold or not hold or have the ability to buy or sell? And secondly, in terms of your thinking regarding the parent's portfolio?","James Tisch","So the Tax Act will benefit Loews. It will help us at basically all of our subsidiaries and so we should be seeing the benefits of that coming through in our income statements. In terms of the parent company and our investments, it's -- we're paying lower tax on gains and investment income, but otherwise it hasn't changed the way that we invest those funds.","Michael Millman","I was kind of thinking more about, I think, in the past, you talked about how the tax -- or the previous tax laws restricted your ability to do some things, buying and selling some properties. And I was kind of hoping that question would be -- this question would sort of update us on your current thinking.","James Tisch","Yes, so my current thinking is that the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% will make a very -- cause there to be a significant change in corporate behavior across the economy. In terms of Loews, yes, you have a good memory. About 10 years ago, we thought that the level of the capital gains tax -- corporate capital gains tax at 35% really prevented a lot of transactions from occurring. And now that we're down to a tax rate of 21%, I think that, economy-wide, it will foster transactions to occur that otherwise might not have happened with a 35% tax.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Q&A portion of the call.

My name is Christy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Loews Corporation Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] ","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mary Skafidas. Please go ahead.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Loews Corporation's second quarter earnings conference call. A copy of our earnings release, earnings supplement and company overview may be found on our website, loews.com. On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Edelson. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward-looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the Company may differ materially from those made or implied in any forward-looking statements due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings.

During the call today, we might also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our Security filings and earnings supplement for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.","In a few minutes, our CFO, David Edelson will walk you through the key drivers for the quarter. Before he does, Jim Tisch, our CEO, will kick off the call. Jim, over to you.","James Tisch","Thank you, Mary. To start things off, I want to spend a few minutes talking about Loews\u2019 decision to redeem Boardwalk\u2019s outstanding LP units. As I mentioned on our last call, as a result of the decision in March of this year by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, we began to rethink the efficacy and wisdom of the MLP structure for Boardwalk\u2019s. ","After careful consideration of all options, we determined that exercising our call provision was in the best interest of Loews\u2019 shareholders. On June 29, we announced that we would redeem Boardwalk\u2019s outstanding LP units at a formula price of $12.06 per share for a total cost to Loews of slightly over $1.5 billion. The transaction closed in July. ","We were able to execute this transaction by tapping the ample liquidity in the Loews\u2019 corporate treasury. I\u2019ll be talking more about Boardwalk on future calls. Now, onto other Loews\u2019 business. ","Loews had a strong second quarter, positively impacted once again by consistent earnings from CNA. Premium growth for the \u2013 for CNA remains strong and the company saw a positive rate trends in the second quarter. ","Additionally, the underlying loss ratio improved in the first half of the year from an already strong base. Earlier this morning, CNA announced a 17% increase in its regular dividend reflecting CNA's strong operating results and outlook. And moreover on the subject of CNA I would also like to take the opportunity to thank Craig Mense, who is retiring after serving as CNA's Chief Financial Officer for the past 14 years. ","The company\u2019s fortuitous balance sheet today is due in large part to Craig\u2019s extraordinary focus and outstanding fiscal management. Craig, if you are listening, we at Loews thank you for your tremendous service and wish you a wonderful retirement. ","Next, I\u2019d like to do a one year checking on our newest subsidiary Consolidated Container Company or CCC. Loews acquired CCC in a transaction that closed in May of last year and I am happy to report that the business is performing well. In 2018, we expect CCC to produce double-digit cash-on-cash return on our equity investment. ","For anyone who may need a quick review, CCC is a leading rigid plastic packaging manufacturer based in Atlanta, Georgia. The company makes containers for stable end-markets such as beverages, motor oil, laundry detergent and dairy products. With the acquisition of CCC, Loews added a new industry to its already diverse portfolio of businesses, as well as another platform for growth. ","When we acquired CCC a year ago, we talked about our desire to grow the business and the CCC team had started that process by making two recent tuck-in acquisitions. The company has bid on more sizable acquisitions only to find that for the bigger company, the prices have been too high. CCC is happy to be patient, more continuing to look for additional acquisition targets. We hope to have more to report in this area in the quarters ahead. ","Another reason we were attracted to CCC was the strong and experienced management team, as well as its track record of operational excellence. Happily, time has only added to our positive opinion of CCC\u2019s senior leadership team. Over the last year, CEO, Sean Fallman and his team have focused on creating greater efficiencies and streamlining production processes to attain better margins. ","Additionally, CCC has placed increased emphasis on their innovative Dura-Lite technology, a patented design that utilizes less resin while creating beverage packaging of higher strength and improved company \u2013 customer ergonomics. For CCC, the Dura-Lite technology has led to increased unit volume and has enhanced relationships with customers. ","Dura-Lite is better for CCC\u2019s customers who end up spending less on packaging materials and better for the environment as well. And while we are in the subject of the environment, there has been a lot of discussion in the news recently about plastics and their affects on our planet. This is an extremely important issue and one that both Loews and CCC take seriously. ","Today, I want to talk about two aspects of plastics and the environment. Single used plastics such as straws, disposable cutlery and plastic lids, and plastic waste that pollutes the world\u2019s oceans. First, I\u2019d like to emphasize that CCC is not in the business of producing single use plastic items. Its focus is on producing primary packaging, designed to protect, and extend the shelf life of the contents inside. ","Of all the packaging that CCC produces, 97% is totally recyclable. In addition to manufacturing packaging, CCC is also the second largest US producer of recycled, high-density polyethylene, a widely used form of plastic. CCC produces a 100 million pounds of this recycled, high-density polyethylene per year. ","As for OceanBound Plastic, 8 million tons of plastic waste ends up in the world\u2019s oceans every year. The vast majority of this plastic, about 60% comes from five countries, China, Indonesia, The Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. By way of comparison, the United States is responsible for about 4% of waterborne plastics.","Acutely aware of the damage that OceanBound Plastic can cause, CCC created a program that recycles plastic from at-risk areas trying to put a dent in the amount of waste that reaches the beaches and waterways. In 2017, CCC committed to recycling 10 million pounds of OceanBound Plastic by 2019 and today, it\u2019s more than half way to its goal. ","While CCC offers a number of services and products to help minimize the impact of plastic on the environment, solutions from manufacturers are only part of the answer. But the goal is to create a circular economy for the packaging industry and eliminate plastic waste, then we need more companies to be willing to buy and use recycled resin in their products, which to-date has not been the case. ","Also, community which is worldwide need to develop the proper infrastructure to support recycling as consumer demand for recycled plastic products increases, CCC is ready, willing and able to provide them. ","Moving on, I want to give a quick shot out to Diamond Offshore. In recent contract negotiations, the company has increased its backlog on three drill ships by five years. This level of activity is a sign that demand for offshore drilling rigs is increasing, as well as a testament to Diamond Offshore\u2019s reputation and operational excellence. Well done. ","And finally, before I turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson, I want to talk briefly about share repurchases. Year-to-date through last Friday, Loews has repurchased 16.6 million shares of its stock or 5% of the outstanding shares at a total cost of approximately $814 million. These buybacks reflects our confidence in the underlying businesses, as well as our belief that the intrinsic value of Loews is significantly higher than the market price for our shares. ","It\u2019s safe to say that, share repurchases remain one of our major capital allocation tools for creating a long-term value for our shareholders. ","And now, David, over to you. ","David Edelson","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Loews reported net income of $230 million in the quarter essentially unchanged from $231 million in last year's second quarter. However, earnings per share increased to $0.72 from $0.69 as average shares outstanding declined 5% due to share repurchase activity. ","Before I walk through the key drivers for the quarter, I\u2019d like to briefly discuss the recently closed purchase of the common units of Boardwalk Pipeline not previously owned by Loews, as well as the status of our parent company portfolio of cash and investments. ","As Jim commented, we spent approximately $1.5 billion in the Boardwalk transaction. Following the transaction, and our share repurchase activity, the parent company investment portfolio stands at approximately $3.1 billion, down from $4.7 billion at the end of the second quarter. In keeping with our strategy of holding substantial liquidity, we are rebalancing the parent company portfolio more toward cash and equivalents. ","I would note that even after the Boardwalk transaction, we hold cash and investments far exceeding our $1.8 billion of parent company debt. The rating agencies have all maintained their Loews rating and outlooks. ","Now for some comments on our segments. CNA contributed net income of $240 million in Q2, down slightly from the second quarter of 2017. P&C underwriting income was up year-over-year, as CNA posted a combined ratio of 93.8, basically comparable to last year\u2019s second quarter along with a 5% increase in net earned premium. ","The lower corporate tax rate benefited after-tax underwriting income. Investment income was also strong with improved returns on the LP portfolio and higher after-tax returns on the fixed income portfolio. CNA incurred one-time costs in Q2 2018 as it transitioned to a new IT infrastructure service provider. ","Additionally, CNA had significant realized gains in last year\u2019s second quarter versus minimal realized losses this year. CNA's core income, which excludes realized gains and losses was up 13% in the quarter. Diamond Offshore contributed a net loss of $37 million in Q2 2018, as compared to net income of $7 million last year. ","Diamond\u2019s profit margin was hurt by a 32% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues versus only a 3.6% decline in contract drilling costs. Revenue earning days and average daily revenue were both down. Diamond booked rig impairment charges in both periods, which reduced Diamond\u2019s contribution to our net income by $12 million this year and $23 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. ","Boardwalk\u2019s net income contribution was $16 million, up from $6 million in Q2 2017. During Q2, 2017, Boardwalk\u2019s net income contribution reflected a $15 million loss on the sale of a processing facility. Excluding this loss, Boardwalk\u2019s contribution declined $5 million year-over-year. ","Boardwalk experienced a 7% year-over-year decline in net operating revenues, as incremental revenues from growth projects did not make up for the negative revenue impact including the 2017 restructuring of the firm\u2019s transportation agreement, a decline in storage and parking and lending revenues and contract expirations.","Boardwalk\u2019s operating expenses were up slightly due to an increased asset base from recently completed growth projects. For many months, equity analysts were overestimating Boardwalk\u2019s revenue and earnings prospects for the second quarter and full year. I would note that the company\u2019s performance is consistent with our expectations and those of Boardwalk\u2019s management. ","As a reminder, Boardwalk will continue to file with the SEC because it has bonds outstanding. However, the company will no longer hold quarterly earnings calls. ","Loews Hotels contributed net income of $17 million, up from $10 million in Q2 2017. Miami Beach drove the increase with Coronado, Ventana Canyon, Orlando and many others also contributing. A lower effective tax rate in Q2 2018 enabled Loews Hotels to drop more of its income to the bottom-line. Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings supplement rose 8% from last year's second quarter to $66 million.","During the third quarter, Loews Hotels and Universal will open the 600 room Aventura Hotel at Universal, Orlando. Loews Hotels will then have 6200 rooms at Universal Orlando with another 2800 rooms expected to come online in Orlando over the next two years. ","Turning to the parent company. Pretax investment income was $42 million, up $40 million from the prior year\u2019s second quarter driven by higher returns on alternatives, equities and cash. The lower corporate tax rate benefited after-tax results in Q2 2018. ","Corporate and other improved $11 million in pretax year-over-year primarily due to the absence of CCC-related transaction expenses in 2018 as well as other corporate expenses \u2013 lower other corporate expenses. The higher after-tax loss was solely attributable to the lower tax rate. ","We received $86 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the second quarter, $73 million from CNA, and $13 million from Boardwalk. As long as Boardwalk maintains its current distribution, our quarterly distribution from Boardwalk would be close to $26 million going forward. ","CNA announced this morning a $0.05 increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.35. At that rate, Loews would receive ordinary dividends of $85 million quarterly, and $340 million annually from CNA before considering its special dividend. ","We repurchased 5.8 million shares during the second quarter at an aggregate cost of $290 million. During July, we have repurchased another 1 million shares for $49 million. As Jim mentioned, we have repurchased a total of 16.6 million shares year-to-date representing 5% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. ","Finally, I\u2019d point out that the accounting for the Boardwalk transaction resulted in our book value increasing by $2 per share at June 30. Let me now hand the call back to Jim. ","James Tisch","Thank you, David. Before we open up the call for questions, I want to highlight a new addition to our Investor Relations materials. Some of you have asked for more information about our subsidiary strategies and mid to long-term prospects for growth. In response to your requests, we have now posted on our website presentations for CNA, Diamond Offshore, CCC and Loews Hotels narrated by the respective CEOs and leadership teams. ","Boardwalk\u2019s presentation will be added later this year. We are happy to provide these virtual Investor Day style presentations and we look forward to hearing your feedback and answering any questions you might have. ","Now, back to Mary. ","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Jim. Christy, we are ready for the Q&A portion of the call. If you would like to queue the folks listening. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Montgomery Scott. ","Robert Glasspiegel ","Good morning, everyone. I am going to dig around on Boardwalk to the best I can. Jim, you put $1.5 billion in and you sort of gave a low key discussion of it. Are you really excited about this? Is this something you just had to do? How should we think about it? Then I have some accounting questions.","James Tisch","Listen, we\u2019ve always thought Boardwalk is an excellent asset. The changes in FERC made it so that, we really felt the need to exercise the call. And that\u2019s really where we are right now. Nothing has changed about our long-term view concerning Boardwalk.","Robert Glasspiegel ","What sort of cash-on-cash return, you talked about some of your other investments at the current runrate?","James Tisch","So, Boardwalk was paying a dividend of $0.40 a year and it\u2019s our expectation that Boardwalk will be able to continue to pay those dividends. ","Robert Glasspiegel ","Okay, that\u2019s sort of your dividend return, but, just sort of on the value of an investment, at some point the cash flow starts to grow a decent bit if these investments come through, right?","James Tisch","Yes, listen, I said in my remarks that we will be talking more about Boardwalk in the later call and that\u2019s really what I\u2019d like to do now. ","Robert Glasspiegel ","Okay. And then a less substantive question on Boardwalk. Just an accounting question. You are doubling sort of the dividend and doubling the earnings, but there is some purchase accounting adjustments in perhaps goodwill that might offset that. On a simplistic basis, if we double sort of the current runrate of earnings, what other adjustments need to be considered goodwill, purchase accounting et cetera?","David Edelson","Very insignificant, Bob. Let\u2019s take that offline, but it\u2019s very insignificant. ","Robert Glasspiegel ","Okay. So, if we double the earnings runrate will it be close to where you are doing?","David Edelson","Yes, sir.","Robert Glasspiegel ","And you are using cash, so it should be a decent bit accretive from an EPS perspective, correct?","David Edelson","Correct. We are using balance sheet cash. ","Robert Glasspiegel ","Okay. Thank you. ","James Tisch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. ","Joshua Shanker ","So, I am going to ask bleak question and violate the Boardwalk silence, but it\u2019s really not about Boardwalk\u2019s portfolio management. In the past, you\u2019ve said that if you made another - before Consolidated Container, if you made another acquisition, you\u2019d ideally like to avoid it being in the energy sector, because you just \u2013 you want to be more diversified. ","How does expanding the investment in Boardwalk impact, I mean, look \u2013 you buy when you buy it, but at the same time, what\u2019s the portfolio management philosophy? And are you more exposed to energy than you want to be all of a sudden? ","James Tisch","No, I don\u2019t think so. Loews has a market cap of 16 \u2013 $15 billion or $16 billion. This adds another $1.5 billion of exposure to energy Boardwalk. Already it was a $1.5 billion exposure. So now, it\u2019s $3 billion out of a total of $16 billion, add another $1.5 billion for Diamond Offshore and you see that CNA dwarfs both of those investments. So, in terms of portfolio management, I am not so concerned about the size of Boardwalk. ","Joshua Shanker ","On hotels, can we talk about the new hotel, how much of a drag it is to be building a hotel out not just that hotel \u2013 but in general? And when the hotel is built, what kind of expense reduction we see but that moment is passed and what kind of income comes in for a large property?","David Edelson","Well, I would say, Josh, you are right. Obviously, you are in \u2013 when you are in building mode, you are not generating revenue and you are incurring expense although a good bit of expense is capitalized of course. And then as you approach opening, you have preopening expenses which are expense. So \u2013 and then, takes just a wee bit of time for a hotel to get up and running into it sort of earnings revenue and earnings runrate. ","But I would say, given the magnitude of Loews Hotels at this point, a 600 room hotel is not \u2013 it obviously the company can withstand it and generate strong profitability and strong year-over-year growth as well. Remember, this is the only hotel under construction. There are Kansas City that we have discussed, Arlington Texas that we have discussed, St. Louis that we have discussed and of course, these new hotels in Orlando. So there is certainly the prospect for significantly higher revenue and goodwill and profitability going forward. ","James Tisch","We believe that these six projects that we\u2019re currently working on will be hotels that have RevPAR and EBITDA that far outpace what\u2019s available in their particular markets now. ","Joshua Shanker ","And if you\u2019ll put me one more, because I know there is usually a long queue. The \u2013 in terms of Consolidated Container, I have not looked at the new presentations on the website. But I want if one of you can talk to me about the pipeline for bolt-ons in general, how many general conversations you are having with potential future partners or future acquisitions at a given time? And over \u2013 like a three year period, is there a way to gauge how much money we can Consolidated Container will be spending on bolt-ons?","James Tisch","So, the bolt-ons which are \u2013 what you might call mom and pops can range in price from $5 million to $20 million, $30 million, $40 million or $50 million. When we buy them, there are a lot of synergies that mean that if we buy them at a particular multiple, we could save, say, two EBITDA turns by buying them and including them in our systems due to the synergies that we have. There are lots and lots of these mom and pops in the industry and as you might imagine, as you get to larger sizes, there are fewer and fewer. ","David Edelson","And Josh, I would say, just given the fragmented nature of the industry, in terms of the number of conversations going on in any given time, many, but at various different stages of course. So, there is a significant pipeline that is being nurtured. ","Joshua Shanker ","That\u2019s right. Just stuck, I don\u2019t know if there is a way for scaling that, I guess.","David Edelson","Yes, I mean, they\u2019ve done two in the past year. We would hope that they would continue if not accelerate that pace. So\u2026","James Tisch","They\u2019ve done two, but they\u2019ve kept the tires of an awful lot more.","Joshua Shanker ","And then, quickly one more. You might have already said it, what gives the imbalance of unencumbered cash on the balance sheet at Loews right now post the Boardwalk transaction?","James Tisch","We have about $3.1 billion of cash after the $1.5 billion went out for the Boardwalk purchase and we have $1.8 billion of debt.","David Edelson","Yes. ","Joshua Shanker ","Okay, thank you very much. ","David Edelson","And by the way, I would just \u2013 I would be remised to not pointing out that the debt comes due anywhere between 2023 and 2043. So, it\u2019s not that if there is a short-term call. ","Joshua Shanker ","Okay, absolutely. Thank you. ","David Edelson","Thank you. ","James Tisch","There are no other questions. So I want to answer the question that wasn\u2019t asked. And the question that wasn\u2019t asked is, what do I think of the price reaction of CNA to its earnings today? And my answer is I am totally befuddled. My own belief is that CNA was very cheap going into this earnings call. CNA reported what we at Loews thought was very good earnings and as a result, the stock is down 3% or 4% today. ","So, I am very surprised at CNA's price actions. As you all know, we\u2019ve bought a lot of Loews\u2019 shares, 5% of the shares just this year and a lot of the reason for the purchase of the shares was because, we believe in CNA and CNA is such a big factor in the Loews\u2019 share price. There is 0.77 CNA shares for every Loews share and as I said previously, the value of CNA to Loews dwarfs the value of our other subsidiaries. ","So, in my view, not only our CNA\u2019s share is down, but also that some of the parts is quite dramatic to us. So, it makes us \u2013 it makes us, I would say surprised at just what\u2019s going on in terms of the valuations of CNA and of Loews. But I guess, it\u2019s better for us, us meaning the shareholders who are still in the company. ","Mary Skafidas","Great. Thank you, Jim. Christy, we\u2019d like to conclude the call for today.

Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session, which will include questions from shareholders.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward-looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those made or implied in any forward-looking statements due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is only a brief summary of the company's statutory forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included in the company's filings with the SEC.","During the call today, we might also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our security filings and earnings supplement for reconciliation to those comparable GAAP measures.","In a few minutes, our CFO, David Edelson, will walk you through the key drivers for the quarter. But before he does, Jim Tisch, our CEO, will kick off the call. Jim, over to you.","Jim Tisch","Thank you, Mary, and good morning.","Loews is off to a good start in 2019, due primarily to CNA, our largest subsidiary. Building on its momentum over the last several years, CNA had strong quarterly results. Since Dino Robusto became the CEO at the end of 2016, CNA's key financial metrics have been steadily improving. In comparing full-year 2016 results with first quarter 2019 results, the progress is clear. The underlying combined ratio improved by 3 points with the loss ratio decreasing by 2 points, and the expense ratio decreasing by 1 point.","Notwithstanding this solid progress, CNA is still not satisfied. The company remains committed to further improving its underwriting performance, continuing to strengthen relationships with distributors to grow its book of business, and managing its expenses diligently.","CNA continues to mitigate risk in its long-term care book of business by carefully managing claims and obtaining rate increases from state regulators when justified. CNA is also exploring new strategies that would simultaneously lessen the effects of rate increases on policyholders and meaningfully reduce CNA's exposure.","As CNA moves forward, we are confident that the company will continue to grow its business profitably and responsibly, and that it can and will deliver even stronger operating results in the future. CNA's financial stability and strength as well as this continually improving operational performance is a major reason why Loews has recently purchased so many of its own shares.","Through last Friday, we've bought 7.8 million shares or about 2.5% of the outstanding shares spending about $370 million so far in 2019. But this is nothing new for us. In 2018, we repurchased more than 20 million shares of Loews common stock representing about 6.1% of our outstanding shares at a cost of just over $1 billion. In our view, these share repurchases benefit from what I\u2019d call a triple discount. First, we believe Loews is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value; second, CNA is a high yielding stock with great prospects yet it's trading at a PE discount to its peers; and third, CNA's peer companies in the P&C insurance industry are trading at a notable discount to the S&P 500.","In my view, this triple discount makes repurchasing our shares an attractive value creation lever for us. I feel like the stock market is giving us a gift, and to the extent that our shares continue to trade at what we consider to be an extraordinary discount, we are comfortable buying them in.","Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to mention some good news from Diamond Offshore. Earlier this morning, the company announced new contracts for two of its drillships with Woodside Petroleum, a major Australian E&P company. These contracts would add more than four years of backlog at attractive market rates with potential for follow-on work. The first rig is expected to start drilling in late 2020. While the day rate is not disclosed, the growth in Diamond's backlog suggests that this charter with Woodside represents a significant uptick in charter rates, due in large part I believe to Diamond's stellar operating record.","David, over to you?","David Edelson","Thank you, Jim, and good morning.","For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $394 million or $1.27 per share compared to $293 million or $0.89 per share in last year's first quarter. This healthy increase was driven by two main factors. Number one, strong investment results at both CNA and the parent company stoked by the first quarter's robust equity market performance; and number two, Boardwalk Pipeline whose contribution to our net income more than doubled year-over-year mainly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to the current 100%.","While our net income was up 34% over the prior year, earnings per share increased 43% as average shares outstanding declined 5.6% from last year's first quarter.","Now let me walk through the ins and outs of the quarter, starting with CNA which accounted for over 75% of our net income in Q1 2019. CNA contributed net income of $305 million. This 17% increase was driven by three main factors. Number one, higher net investment income; number two, a higher level of investment gains; and number three, improved performance in CNA's corporate segment.","Before describing these three drivers, I'd highlight that CNA continues to successfully execute on its strategy of profitable premium growth.","P&C underwriting income was down, however, year-over-year as CNA posted an all-in combined ratio in the quarter of 97.8% versus 93.1% in Q1 2018. The increase in the combined ratio was attributable to higher year-over-year cat losses, a lower level of favorable prior-year development, and a slightly higher underlying combined ratio.","Importantly, the underlying combined ratio, which excludes cat losses in prior year development came in at 94.9%. While this is higher than last year's first quarter, it is below CNA's full-year 2018 underlying combined ratio of 95.4%. CNA's underlying loss ratio in the quarter was extremely strong coming in below 61%, about one point better than the underlying loss ratio for full-year 2018.","On the CNA earnings call earlier today, CFO James Anderson highlighted why it makes sense to compare this quarter's underlying underwriting results to full-year 2018. Let me return to the three things that drove CNA's year-over-year earnings increase.","Number one, CNA reported after-tax net investment income of $465 million, up $60 million over last year's first quarter and $186 million better than fourth quarter results. The fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the sell-off in the equity markets. The year-over-year improvement in NII was attributable almost entirely to returns on CNA's portfolio of limited partnership in equity investments. This portfolio returned 4.5% in Q1 2019 versus 1.3% last year and a negative 5.7% last quarter.","Number two, CNA reported after-tax investment gains of $24 million versus $10 million last year. CNA records the mark-to-market on its non-redeemable preferred stock holdings in investment gains and losses.","And number three, the after-tax loss in CNA's corporate segment declined to $6 million in Q1 2019 compared to a $60 million loss last year as the company recorded a net retroactive reinsurance benefit this year as compared to a net charge in Q1 2018.","As a reminder, the retroactive reinsurance results relate to the 2010 loss portfolio transfer with National Indemnity involving CNA's asbestos and environmental pollution reserves. CNA conducted an LPT reserve review in last year's first quarter. Subsequently, however, the company decided to conduct these reviews in the fourth quarter going forward. As such there was no review or charge in Q1 2019. In fact, results benefited from the amortization of the deferred gain associated with the LPT.","Taken together, the year-over-year favorable variances in CNA's investment income, investment gains, and corporate segment amounted to $114 million after-tax for Loews.","Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed $37 million net loss in the first quarter compared to a $10 million positive contribution in last year's first quarter. As a reminder, Diamond's after-tax contribution last year would have been a $13 million loss if not for the favorable impact of the reversal of an uncertain tax position in the quarter.","The increase to year-over-year loss was an outgrowth of the challenging conditions in the global offshore drilling market. Diamond experienced a 21% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues as revenue earning days were down 9% and average daily revenue per working rig was down 12%. Contract drilling margins declined 10 points from 36% to 26%.","Diamond remains focused on maintaining a healthy liquidity position, while investing in its fleet to ensure its rigs are considered top tier by customers.","Boardwalk's net income contribution more than doubled to $79 million predominantly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to 100% in the third quarter of 2018. Operationally, Boardwalk had a good quarter. Net revenues were up 3.6% and EBITDA margins expanded by about two points. Pre-tax income at Boardwalk rose 11% over Q1 2018.","The revenue increase was propelled by growth projects and the transportation storage of natural gas liquids. Revenue offsets included a decline in parking and lending and natural gas storage and the net impact of contract restructurings, expirations, and renewals.","Moving on to Loews Hotels which contributed $13 million to our net income in Q1 2019 the same amount as last year. Those hotels underlying year-over-year earnings gains from ongoing operational improvements were obscured by strategic repositioning activity as the company both develops new hotels and selectively divests properties that no longer fit its strategy.","The company booked unusual charges of $3.6 million after-tax in Q1 made up largely of an impairment charge on a property held-for-sale and pre-opening expenses on properties under development. Such charges were negligible in last year's first quarter.","Those hotels adjusted EBITDA which excludes non-recurring items and as reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary was $61 million in the quarter, up from $57 million in last year's first quarter.","Turning to the Parent company, investment income was up markedly with higher returns on equities driving the year-to-year increase. At March 31, the Parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.4 billion with over 70% in cash and equivalents and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a portfolio of limited partnership investments. As a reminder, the Parent company portfolio totaled close to $4.9 billion on March 31, 2018. The decline over the past 12 months resulted primarily from share repurchase activity together with the purchase last summer of the Boardwalk LP units not previously owned by Loews.","Importantly, over the past year, we have kept our focus on liquidity by reducing our holdings of non-cash assets in favor of maintaining a high-level of cash and equivalents.","We received $596 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the first quarter, $26 million from Boardwalk, and $570 million from CNA which includes the $0.35 regular quarterly dividend and the $2 special dividend.","As Jim mentioned, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter for a total of $322 million. After quarter-end, we repurchased an additional 960,000 shares for $47 million.","Let me now hand the call back to Jim.","Jim Tisch","Thank you, David.","Before we open up the call to questions, I want to quickly talk about Loews investment portfolio. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of 2018, our portfolio, the Loews investment portfolio had a $71 million loss leading to a pre-tax investment loss of $10 million for the year of 2018. Fast forward to the end of the first quarter in 2019 and we have recouped that fourth quarter loss and then some having ended the quarter with net investment income of about $84 million.","The stock market declined 14% in the fourth quarter and has increased 13% in the first quarter. In other words, the volatility in the stock market over that time period was the driver of the volatility in our portfolio.","Mary, back over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Jim. Before we open up the call for questions, we have four questions submitted to us from shareholders. We encourage shareholders to send us questions that they would like us to answer, and we hope that they continue to do so. Our first question is to Jim. Jim since the P&C industry has always traded at a discount to the market, why is today's discount significant as you think about share repurchases?","JimTisch","I believe that the insurance industry, the property and casualty insurance industry, the commercial property and casualty insurance industry where CNA is dramatically less cyclical today than it was previously. 10, 20 or 30 years ago in the insurance industry, companies would earn money, they would accumulate on their balance sheet as capital, and with increasing levels of capital, they would feel they had to write more business. They would write that business, they would compete rates down significantly, and then things would get bad in the industry and they would stop writing so much business because capital had dried up and then things would move up again.","The industry today is no longer cyclical like that. And the reason is I believe that Jay Fishman of blessed [ph] memory who is the CEO of Travelers for more than a decade started to buy, started to use his earnings to pay dividends and repurchase shares. And if you look at Travelers over his time as CEO, you see that statutory capital which is an index of how much business you can write never increased. But the stock price went up dramatically and that was a lesson to a lot of other companies in our sector of the market, so you see today that there is dramatically less price competition.","I believe to the fact that capital, unnecessary capital is not accumulating on the balance sheets of insurance companies but rather it's being used to pay dividends and repurchase shares?","So, I think that going back to the question, the property and cas, our sector of the P&C industry trades my guess at about a 25% discount to the S&P 500. I think in view of the dynamics today in the market such an enormous discount is just not warranted anymore.","Mary Skafidas","Okay, thank you, Jim. Our next question is from a shareholder who wants to know about CCC Loews' recent acquisition or most recent acquisition. So they ask, it\u2019s been about two years since you acquired CCC. Can you please give us an update?","Jim Tisch","Sure. So just as a reminder, we got into -- when we got into CCC, we\u2019ve been studying the packaging industry for a few years, and then when we had the opportunity to buy CCC, it was just the right company in just the right sector of the market. Its sector of the market is fragmented meaning that there are opportunities for roll-ups. There are significant economies of scale to be had by buying smaller mom and pop businesses in this industry.","And the other thing, there are really good cash on cash returns to be had especially in an environment where short-term interest rates are 0%, 1%, 2% or 3%. So that was why we got into CCC in the first place.","Now let's fast forward. We've had approximately the cash on cash returns that we've expected. We have the platform for growth which has been I think very compelling for us. We're able to buy businesses to the seller at say a nine times EBITDA multiple but in our hands because of our economies of scale; we're able to own them at a six multiple.","We have what I think is a really defensive business that in good times and bad is going to do reasonably well. And I think most important now that we've lived with them for two years, we have a really, really strong management team who knows how to manage their business, knows how to acquire other businesses, are interested in profitable growth not growth at any cost.","So from my perspective, the thesis on CCC is really playing out and we see more opportunities for acquisition, we see opportunities for organic growth, and we're very pleased with how this is working out for Loews and its shareholders.","Mary Skafidas","Excellent, thank you. Our next question is about Diamond. How does Loews feel about Diamond especially in this protracted down cycle?","Jim Tisch","So my guess is we feel much better about Diamond than the market does. Diamond reported excellent earnings -- excellent prospects today yet the stock is down significantly. My view is that at $10 a share, Diamond is trading more like a stock option than it is a stock. We\u2019ve got into Diamond now over 30 years ago and the thing that I've seen about offshore drilling it is highly cyclical.","Let me take you on a short trip down memory lane. When we bought into Diamond, before it went public, we had invested a total of about $300 million. It went public; we got all of our cash back. And then, nothing really happened for a while. I forget what price the stock went public at. As such, come 2007 when the drilling business was really good, the stock got to $140 a share, $140 a share. Diamond used those good times to pay dividends to shareholders. And as I think you all know paid in excess of $40 per Diamond share in dividends.","So now let's fast forward from 2007 to today. Today, Diamond trades just above $10 and just if I couldn't believe that Diamond could get to $140, likewise I can't believe that Diamond has gotten to $10. For what it's worth, I see the seeds of change in the industry. Since 2014, 120 floater rigs have been scrapped.","When you also take out as a fleet, the cold stacked rigs most of which will never come back to work, there are about 200 floating rigs left in the market, and they're operating at about 65% or 70% operating rate. So, I saw this in the shipping industry in the early 80s, and I've seen this in the offshore drilling business. As long as the market stays at the level that it's at, there will continue to be scrapping from the fleet. And additionally, I believe that with oil prices at these levels, $65 on WTI and $70 on Brent, there is more than enough opportunity for our customers to have good operating profits on drilling prospects.","So I think that there will be increases in demand for rigs. I think the size of the fleet will continue to come down, and then one day bam, it's going to happen, supply will have come down, demand will go up. Demand is highly, highly, highly inelastic, and it would not be surprising at all for me -- for all of us to see day rate increases of $50,000, $100,000, $200,000 a day. There's no doubt in my mind that over the next four to five years that can happen.","And the thing, I like about Diamond's position in this industry is that it's got a lot of runway for that to happen. So I actually feel pretty good about where Diamond is. One additional thing, Diamond has for us an $800 million market value. Yet as you can see from the earnings, it has an oversized effect on Loews Corp.'s overall earnings. So it's one of the reasons, I looked at some of the parts for Loews as a value measure as opposed to earnings per share.","Mary Skafidas","Okay, thank you, Jim. Our last question from shareholders has to do with CNA, Jim obviously you think CNA is trading cheap to its peers. What do you think about that valuations of Loews other subsidiaries?","JimTisch","I love all my children both in family and at work. And I've spent a lot of time talking about CNA this morning and in the past because CNA represents a significant portion of the value of Loews. But I also think that all of our other subsidiaries have very good prospects.","I just talked about Diamond Offshore and the upside potential, I see for offshore drilling. I see that in our hotel business where we have lots of opportunities to build hotels at what we consider to be very, very attractive rates of return for us.","I see it in Boardwalk Pipelines where we've had down EBITDA and chances are -- sorry flat EBITDA and the possibility of down EBITDA going forward. But over the past year, I think there are up -- we've also seen some opportunities for some upside.","Likewise, CCC has opportunities in front of it. And so when I put it all together, I see overall lots of opportunity for Loews.","The other thing, as I said before, is we're happy buying in our shares. Last year we bought in billion dollars of our shares, we're on a similar pace this year and to the extent that Loews shares are like Rodney Dangerfield and not getting any respect, we're happy to buy them in.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you. Okay. Christie we'd like to turn it --","Jim Tisch","This is not Christie.","Mary Skafidas","Clearly. Christie, we'd like to turn the call over to you and open up the call for additional questions from conference call participants.","Operator","Sure. [Operator Instructions].","And your first question is from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Good morning. So I don't mean to be reductive but I call Loews a multiline investment conglomerate. I hope you won't be too disappointed.","Jim Tisch","I call it -- we are -- I call it unabashedly a conglomerate. So no we're not upset with that.","Josh Shanker","Okay. So one of your not early competitor, but one of your peers who was a very established company said recently that he would expect to warn your shareholders over the long run that he doesn't think you can much outperform the S&P 500. And is that a function of -- you don't have to speak about his company. But when you think about Loews, is Loews ability, I'm thinking long-term, do so a function of size and does that diminish over time or is it that you have an unusual mix of businesses you believe that are better than market businesses?","Jim Tisch","So I know Loews really well. I don't know the S&P 500 as well as I know Loews. So I can't opine to you whether Loews is going to outperform or underperform the S&P 500. What I know is that the opportunity set that we have in front of us at Loews given our cash flow, given our five individual businesses, and given our share price. What I know is that I think there is a great opportunity for us to build value for our shareholders over the intermediate and long-term.","As for whether or not we'll outperform the S&P 500, I don't know that's not -- that's not my bogey because I can't control in any way what other companies are doing within their industries.","Josh Shanker","Okay. By extension look you're also -- you do generally a lot of free cash and you can use that to buy back your own stock or you can use that to become an expert in another company and buy that company. Do you believe that ultimately the valuation discount of Loews is so great that the benchmark necessary to put new money to work in a sixth business is quite high for you to try and exceed?","Jim Tisch","Yes. So there is one other factor that you didn't mention. And that is probably $1 trillion of unused equity at private equity firms and those firms can easily lever up by 100%. So that means that there's probably $2 trillion of dry powder sitting in those firms. And as a result, we see very high prices for businesses that are in what I would call the sweet spot of what we're looking for. We don't need to buy another business. And from the actions speak louder than words department, what you can see is that our investment focus has been and continues to be repurchase of our own shares.","Josh Shanker","And then I guess I might misquote you, Jim, but a few times you've had a Eureka moment, where you could say, \"This little money buys this much stuff\". I don't think that's exactly how you said it. Do you expect to have one of those again or is market efficiency gotten to the point where the idea that you're going to find oil tankers available at scrap value just doesn't possibly make sense anymore?","JimTisch","Yes, so that was the -- you're quoting the Jim Tisch $5 million test that I developed in about 1982 standing on the deck of a Supertanker where I looked to the front, I looked to the rear, I looked to both sides. I scratched my head and I said you mean you get all this for $5 million?","And in fact I thought that was a once in a lifetime opportunity. But in fact just eight years later, the Jim Tisch $5 million test came in handy in getting into the offshore drilling business where I stood on the deck of an offshore drilling rig, and uttered literally, the exact same words to myself. So since that day in 1988, no, we haven't seen another time when the $5 million test worked for us. I'm sure that it occurred to other people and we're always on the lookout for such opportunities. But at the present time, my crystal ball doesn't show any that are waiting for us to snatch them up.","Josh Shanker","All right. And one final question that may dovetail. You mentioned getting out of hotels that no longer fits the strategy of Loews Hotels and acquiring more properties that do. Can you enunciate in a concise way what the strategy is right now?","Jim Tisch","Sure. We have learned a lot from our experience in Orlando where we're operating six hotels at above market room rates and above market occupancy. And those hotels have earned very significant rates of returns for us and our partners at Universal.","And so we've translated that experience into our strategy for our hotel business. Rather than buying hotels in cities that may or may not fully fit, what we're trying to do, we are building our own properties oftentimes in partnership with municipalities that really fit into this strategy of having a demand driver nearby where we can do significant amounts of Group business and earn what we believe are above market returns on our equity investments. And we're building in Texas now, we're building in Kansas City, we're building in St. Louis, we're building more hotels in Orlando. And from my perspective, our plate is pretty full.","And we see, we're generating new opportunities every year. So I feel really good about the strategy. I feel really good about the opportunity set and now it's going to be up to us and the people in our hotel company to execute and generate the returns that we think are entirely within reach.","Josh Shanker","Great. I make sure that I call you after I develop my novels into a Theme Park as well.","JimTisch","Okay.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Josh. That concludes our call for today. As always we want to thank you for your continued interest. A replay will be available on our website, loews.com in approximately two hours. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"12888":["Loews Corporation (NYSE:L) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 28, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Corporate Participants","Mary Skafidas - VP of IR and Corporate Communications","Jim Tisch - Chief Executive Officer","David Edelson - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Loews Corporation Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Mary Skafidas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Laurie, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Loews Corporation's third quarter earnings conference call. A copy of our earnings release, earnings supplement, and company overview, may be found on our Web site, loews.com.","On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Edelson. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session, which will include questions from shareholders.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward-looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those made or implied in any forward-looking statements due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is only a brief summary of the company's statutory forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included in the company's filings with the SEC.","During the call today, we might also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our security filings and earnings supplement for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.","In a few minutes, our CFO, David Edelson will walk you through key drivers for the quarter, but before he does, Jim Tisch, our CEO, will kick off the call.","Jim, over to you.","Jim Tisch","Thank you, Mary, and good morning.","Loews had much better quarter than the numbers might indicate with our largest subsidiary CNA contributing positively to our results. CNA is continuing to see solid growth in rate which increased about 6% across the P&C business. Even as rate increased retention remained in line with past quarters at 83%. New business also increased 10% over last year's third quarter. While higher rates and new business growth are already forming through net return premiums, which are up about 8% compared to the prior year, the full positive impact will take time to be reflected in earned premium.","Additionally, the third quarter is the time when CNA reviews its long-term care book of business. For the first time since 2015, CNA's assumptions were unlocked resulting in a third quarter after tax charge at CNA of $170 million. The charge predominantly relates to expectations for lower interest rate in both the short and long-term. As a reminder, this is a GAAP charge that as no impact on statutory capital. Also, this charge was partially offset by a $44 million after tax release from CNA's long-term care claims reserves.","As is my custom, every quarter I pick a few key topics to talk about. This quarter, I would like to focus on capital allocation and the growth prospects for several of our subsidiaries. Loews typically allocates capital at the holding company in three ways; share repurchases, investing in our subsidiaries and acquiring the new subsidiary. Over the past five years, we have allocated capital using all three of these levers.","As anyone who follows us knows stock buybacks are a primary capital allocation tool and a significant means of creating shareholder value at Loews. In 2014, Loews had 30% more shares outstanding than at the end of this quarter. In 2018, Loews spent a little over $1 billion to repurchase about $20 million of its shares. So, far in 2019, we have spent about $725 million to repurchase approximately 14.5 million. That means at over the past 22 months we have repurchased over 10% of our outstanding float. As you might imagine, we believe these purchases will prove to be accretive for long-term Loews shareholders.","Our second capital allocation lever is investing in our subsidiaries, the businesses and industries we know best. Loews Corporation's recent investments in Loews hotels provide a good illustration of this lever.","Since 2014, the parent company has supported Loews hotels growth with an investment of $820 million and as received over 80% back from the hotel company for a net investment of nearly $140 million through the end of the third quarter of 2019. During this period of expansion and development, Loews hotels have grown its adjusted EBITDA from a $123 million in 2014 to $228 million in 2018.","Loews hotels continues to focus on its strategy of attracting group business as well as developing properties near demand generators such as sports stadiums and the universal Orlando theme parks. In pursuing this strategy, the hotel company has found its niche as a developer, owner and operator. Since most of its competitors are not able to fulfill all three of these functions, Loews hotels has a unique sweet spot as a partner for municipalities and developers, it has the capacity to co-invest and provide meaningful input on the design and development of new construction and to manage the hotels operations upon completion.","As the portfolio of hotels continues to grow through ground up development, it will take time for these investments to produce a noticeable return as development costs, pre-opening expenses and ramp up periods for each new hotel somewhat obscure initial results.","Our third level for capital allocation is adding another leg to the proverbial stool. In 2017, we acquired Consolidated Container Company for approximately $1.2 billion consisting of $600 million in cash and $600 million of debt at the CCC level. This acquisition gave Loews our total hold in the packaging industry. Over the past two years, CCC has added six tuck-in acquisitions, all of which were funded at the CCC level. These acquisitions added scale at extremely attractive post synergy multiples and increased CCCs presence in higher growth pharmaceutical segments.","It's worth noting that Loews does not frequently acquire subsidiaries and given the sky-high valuations in today's market, I don't see that changing. Multiples have moved higher as the private equity world has become accustomed to easy money, low interest rates leading to cheap and readily available debt financing, make levered acquisitions possible even at these precipitous multiples again that we are unwilling to play.","Now I want to talk briefly about growth prospects of CNA and Diamond. At CNA, we remain very bullish both on the fundamentals of the insurance industry and on CNA's growth trajectory which is fueled by the strength of the team that they have put together. CNA will continue to focus on maintaining and improving its strong underwriting culture, recruiting and retaining top talent, leveraging technology and expanding distribution. These steps will enable CNA to capitalize on its organic growth opportunities. If you talk to Dino Robusto, CNA CEO, he'll tell you that there was plenty of room for organic growth.","The focus for Diamond Offshore is quite different. The company is less occupied with growth and more occupied with managing its liquidity. Diamond continues to concentrate on controlling its cost structure, strengthening its balance sheet and building its revenue backlog. Even as Diamond has kept its foundation solid, it continues to develop process innovations then make it more efficient and a value added partner for its customers.","Finally, last year we began making more detailed information available on our websites about our subsidiary strategies and mid to long-term prospects for growth. In response to your request, we have updated and reposted these presentations for CCC, CNA, Diamond Offshore, and Loews hotels all narrated by their respective CEOs and leadership teams.","We're happy to provide these virtual Investor Day style presentations and we encourage you to listen to them and reach out to us if you have any questions.","And without any further ado, I'll hand the call over to David Edelson. Loews' CFO.","David Edelson","Thank you, Jim. Good morning everyone.","For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $72 million or $0.24 per share down from $278 million or $0.88 per share in last year's third quarter. Page 13 of our earnings supplements sets forth the key quarterly drivers.","A quick summary of the quarter, CNA accounted for most of the year-over-year decline in net income, largely due to the strengthening of its long-term care active life reserves. CNA's property casualty results also reflected a modest reserve charge this year compared to a meaningful reserve release in Q3 last year. Importantly, however, underlying P&C underwriting results at CNA continue to show improvement. Boardwalk's earnings contribution was essentially flat with the prior year, whereas contributions from Diamond and Loews hotels were down for reasons I'll explain shortly.","Parent company investment income showed a nice year-over-year quarterly increase, driven namely by better returns on equities and short-term investments.","Now for more detail, CNA is after tax earnings contribution was $96 million down from $300 million in Q3 2018. Let me start by focusing on the positive, which is continued progress in CNA's core P&C business. The underlying combined ratio was 94.6, the same as the last quarter and almost 1 point better than full year 2018. Net written premium was up 8% in the quarter and rate was up almost 6% and what is typically a heavy quarter for catastrophe losses, CNA incurred only 1.8 points of cat losses compared to 2.6 points in last year's third quarter and 3.7 points for full year 2018. The year-over-year comparison for P&C, however, was hurt by modest adverse prior year development compared to meaningful favorable prior development in last year's third quarter. This adverse development was driven by legacy [indiscernible] exposures in commercial and health care and specialty. Several other lines in commercial and specialty, however, including surety and management liability posted reserve releases during the quarter. Absent the impact of prior year development in both periods, CNA's after tax PNC underwriting income increased 33% from Q3 2018 to Q3 2019. CNA completed its review of its long-term care reserves this past quarter.","As a reminder, CNA's GAAP long-term care reserves have two components, future policy benefit reserves commonly referred to as active life reserves as well as claims and claims adjustment expense reserves. During the quarter, CNA strengthened his active life reserves by 216 million pretax and released 56 million pretax from its claims and claims adjustment expense reserves.","To put these numbers in perspective, at June 30, 2019, CNA had over $9 billion of GAAP active life reserves and almost $3 billion of GAAP claims reserves. CNA assesses the adequacy of its GAAP long-term care active life reserves annually by performing what's known as a gross premium valuation or GPV. In the GPV, management uses its current best estimate actuarial assumptions to calculate required reserves. If the required reserves exceed recorded reserves and unlocking occurs and active life reserves are increased based on the current best estimate assumptions.","CNA as Jim said, CNA last unlocked its LTC active life reserves at year end 2015. The company subsequently conducted reviews of these reserves in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018 and concluded that no unlocking was necessary. In this year's third quarter, when CNA applied its current best estimate actuarial assumptions towards LTC active life reserves, the result was an approximate 400 million increase in required reserves. The interest rate environment caused CNA to lower; it's assumed future new money rates and thus its discount rate. While there were gives and takes with respect to other actuarial assumptions such as morbidity, persistency, and premium rate actions lowering the discount rate drove the unlocking.","Given that CNA had $182 million of margin in its active life reserves before the review, this 400 million reserve increase resulted in a $216 million pretax strengthening of CNA's active life reserves. Note that this is a GAAP reserve charge and does not impact CNA statutory long-term care reserves. The strengthening of the active life reserves and the release from the claims and claims adjustment expense reserves taken together reduce Loews' net income by 112 million in Q3. Recall that in last year's third quarter, CNA booked a claims reserve release that added 21 million to our net income.","CNA has disclosed more information about its long-term care business in its quarterly investor presentation, which can be found on its IR Web site.","In summary, CNA's underlying P&C results were healthy, but its contribution to our Q3 results was hurt by the interest rate driven LTC active life reserve charge and the modest adverse prior year development in P&C.","Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a net loss of $48 million in Q3 2019 as compared to a net loss of $27 million last year reflecting the continued difficult conditions in the offshore drilling market. Contract drilling revenues declined 14% while Diamond's contract drilling expenses increased 7%, revenue earning days were actually up 14%, but this was more than offset by a 24% decline in average daily revenue earned. The drivers of the revenue decline were rigs working at lower day rates as well as shipyard time for two of the company's high [spectro] [ph] ships which had previously been earning day rates well above current market.","As a reminder, Diamond incurred the cost of illegal settlement in last year's third quarter which reduced our net income in that quarter by $8 million. Boardwalk's contribution to our net income was basically flat year-over-year at $29 million. As revenue declines from contract expirations and restructuring were more than offset by revenues from growth projects recently placed into service.","Operating margins declined somewhat, however, in part due to the timing of maintenance expenses. Loews hotels had a noisy third quarter as it contributed 3 million to our net income in Q3 down from 11 million in last year's third quarter. There were two main reasons for the year-over-year decline in net income contribution.","The first was the substantial disruption caused by the threat of Hurricane Dorian, which caused widespread cancellations at the company's properties in Orlando and Miami Beach. And the second were pre-opening expenses occurred in connection with properties under development including properties in Orlando, Kansas City and Arlington, Texas. As Jim said, and I'd remind you that was so much hotel development activity taking place, the company's underlying earnings will continue to be massed by pre-opening and startup costs.","Loews hotels adjusted EBITDA which is disclosed in our quarterly earnings supplement also declined year-over-year. The hurricane related disruption at the company's Florida properties was a major factor. Additionally, three properties were divested since last year's third quarter with one property leaving the chain altogether and two becoming managed only hotels. Despite what appears to be a weak quarter, Loews hotels continues to expand its footprint and post improved results at many of its properties.","Turning to the parent company, pretax investment income was $36 million up $31 million from the prior year's third quarter driven by returns on equities and short-term investments. During Q3 2019, we received $111 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $85 million from CNA and $26 million from Boardwalk. We repurchased 3.4 million shares during the third quarter at an aggregate cost of $168 million. We purchased an additional 1.8 million shares since quarter-end for about $90 million. We have repurchased 15 million shares during 2019 for just over $730 million representing almost 5% of our shares outstanding at year-end 2018.","Loews ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in parent company cash and investments with cash and equivalent accounting for over 75% of the portfolio.","Let me now turn it back to Mary.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, David. Before we open up the call for questions, we have a couple of questions submitted from our shareholders. First question deals with CNA. Jim, how do you feel about CNA's management of their long-term care business, especially in light of their Q3 unlocking?","Jim Tisch","So, all of us at Loews, we're extremely comfortable with how the CNA management team is managing the long-term care business. We're impressed by the operational discipline that they've brought to the business and we're also impressed by their efforts to mitigate the risks of this business. For quarter's reserve unlocking, which was caused by the current interest rate outlook, it doesn't change our view in any way.","Let me step back and give you a bit of history. About a dozen years ago, the CNA management team decided that one of the long-term care block of business is in runoff. It still needs to be vigorously and strategically managed. So CNA selected some of the best and the brightest within the company to run the business as a business, actively managing it from every angle. They looked at it from an operations, claims actuarial and more. The goal was to aggressively mitigate the risk and to manage the liability.","Changing the mindset from it being a runoff business to an active business has been critical in this whole process. So, the new team set about gaining a deeper understanding of the business, not just actuarially, but every facet of the business. This understanding has led the team to identify opportunities to mitigate the risks such as more supportable rate increase filings and offerings to policy holders that benefit them, while also enabling CNA to reduce risk.","I truly believe that CNA's actuarial understanding of its block of business is much deeper than it has ever been. Just two years ago, CNA moved to what's called first principles reserving and that gave us the ability to slice and dice the block much more deeply than they previously could. One huge advantage of the company's actuarial advances has been the ability to support ratings increases with much more targeted and credible data, including data from over a 100,000 claims that the company has already processed.","When I take a look at the assumptions made in the company's last unlocking in 2015 compared to the current unlocking what I see on net is a business that is actually pretty reasonably predictable in the medium term. I don't want to diminish the long-term tail risk, but over the medium term, our block of businesses performed basically in line with our expectations with a major exception of interest rates.","Here are some stats that I find compelling. So, since the end of 2015, total claims paid are 2% lower than expected. Our active policy count is 5% lower than expected and the total claim count during that period is slightly lower than expected. These broad measures help to define the risk in the block and they were all predicted quite accurately in the context of a five-year timeframe. So, what CNA got wrong was the interest rate and the spread environment, a problem that's being addressed this quarter. So, while I understand there's a lot of noise around the various long-term care blocks, what I have seen first-hand at CNA is that with the right data, with the management focus and with the appropriate resources thrown at the problem of these blocks are more predictable than I think most outsiders have come to believe. ","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Jim. Next question submitted by shareholder, it has to do with Diamond. With the prolonged downturn in offshore drilling continuing, do you feel Diamond is well managed from a cost perspective?","Jim Tisch","Absolutely. I think that Diamond has done a really good job of managing its costs. It's cut expenses by about 50%. That's at the home office and also across the company. I would say that the head count is as low as possible while also operating efficiently and safely. No expense categories have been spared; there has been cuts in just about everything including employee benefits as well as free coffee within -- at the home office. So, they're aggressively, aggressively managing their expenses and the company is doing its best to manage in what is a very difficult environment.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Jim. Laurie, we'd like to turn the call back over to you for questions in the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Yes. Good morning everybody.","Jim Tisch","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Shanker","Good morning. When the third quarter began on July 1. I know this isn't necessarily how you value the company, but if I take the value of Loews described by the market and subtract out the public values of CNA and Diamond, what I call the stub value was trading at about $5 billion. Two months later, given the decline in Loews price, but the relative stability of CNA's price, the stub value had fallen 45% over those two months. When you think about buying back Loews stock, are you thinking that the parts that are not publicly valued are dramatically undervalued by the market or you thinking that CNA is dramatically undervalued? I know the answer is both, but on a relative basis, there are difference between buying the stock on July 1st and buying the stock on August 30th?","Jim Tisch","Not really. I think of it that both CNA is undervalued and the stub is undervalued. So, and we've talked about this an awful lot. And that's what makes me so bullish on the stock.","Josh Shanker","Is there anything that we can detect in your repurchase appetite that at certain points there's certain valuation studies that you're doing that make you more or less anxious to buy stock over a short period of time?","Jim Tisch","You have to look at is how much stock we buy in a particular quarter. And that will give you a pretty good insight into what our appetite is.","Josh Shanker","So, if I look back over, let's say on the last 18 months, I don't know. I mean, I don't know has your appetite changed over the past 18 months or has it been steady the whole time?","Jim Tisch","It's generally been steady. We bought $1 billion of stock in 2018 and in 2019, through now we're just about at three quarters of $1 billion. So, yes, look, I'm frustrated. I think the stock has a lot of value. We haven't been shy about saying that and notwithstanding that to me, the stock still looks very cheap, but markets are markets.","Josh Shanker","And so, then I'm going to ask you [indiscernible] question I asked you last quarter, I was talking about where interest rates were and talked about if you would be willing to issue more debt simply because the markets were attractive. With your appetite in mind for your own stock. Isn't that a good trade right now to issue debt for the purpose of accelerating your repurchase?","Jim Tisch","Yes. I don't think so. First of all, if we issued debt, if you read the rating agency reports, they want us to hold as much cash as we have debt. So, there is nothing so exciting about issuing debt. Secondly, there isn't enormous volume in low shares, so there's just a limit to how much you can buy. So, I don't know that issuing debt would really do us any good.","Additionally, we have about $3.5 billion of cash now, if we wanted to -- and if the opportunity presented itself, we could use a good portion of that to repurchase more shares. ","Josh Shanker","Okay. And then on another trek, you've talked many, many times on many calls about the market being overvalued for the purpose of buying both public companies and buying private companies competing with private equity. I haven't heard you say too often, which might be the same answer, is hotel starts right now. If you want to build a hotel or buy a hotel, has private equity inflated those values to the point where they're generally unattractive as well?","Jim Tisch","First things first, I don't think the public equities are expensive. I think that valuations in private equity land are expensive.","Josh Shanker","It didn't take out prices of public equity. I mean, if you wanted to take buy the whole thing, yes.","Jim Tisch","Okay. Yes. No, that I agree. With respect to hotels, we are operating in a very discrete, niche in the hotel industry. So, we're -- let's put aside Orlando for a second. We're not developing motels. We're not developing low service hotels. We're developing what we call and what the market calls upper upscale hotels. And generally we're marketing, we're building those hotels with significant meeting space to fit into the core competencies that we have. So, we're building hotels with meeting space near demand drivers. And, we're also doing it generally with help of one sort or another from the local municipalities, to make it so that, our hotels without that help just would not be economic to one that is economic without help.","In order to do that, you have to have a long-term view because it's not a matter of just putting a shovel in the ground. It's a matter of working with the community and negotiating a transaction that's both good for the hotel company as well as the community. And so, this is not an area where we've seen private equity participate. So, no, they're not a factor in this.","David Edelson","And if I could just add Josh, we're not, as you see, we're not going out and just buying existing hotels. We are developing hotels frequently, as Jim said, in conjunction with a municipality or with other partners. So, and what we bring is the ability to manage that hotel and our own capital. So, it's a very different thing than just going out and buying the existing hotel in some sort of option.","Josh Shanker","Okay. Those are all very complete and thorough answers. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Jim Tisch","Thank you.","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Josh. And thank you everyone for listening. That concludes Loews' third quarter 2019 earnings call.

Welcome to the Loews Corporation second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. A copy of our earnings release and earnings snapshot slides may be found on our website loews.com.

Please refer to our securities\u2019 filings for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures. ","I will now turn the call over to Loews\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Jim Tisch.","James Tisch","Thank you, Mary. Good morning and thank you for joining us on our call today. Loews had net income from continuing operations of $303 million, or $0.79 per share, compared to $261 million or $0.67 per share for the second quarter of 2013. ","Before we go into specifics about this quarter, I want to take a moment to focus on HighMount. When Loews acquired HighMount in \u201907, we considered it a low risk gas manufacturing business. Since then, the shale revolution and most notably the Marcellus and Utica plays have dramatically changed the U.S. natural gas market. ","When we bought HighMount, gas was trading at $7 per Mcf, and was thought to be a finite commodity. A year later it hit $14. Since then it has hit lows of $2 per Mcf and it is now at about $3.85. ","In light of the changing circumstances in the natural gas market, last quarter we announced that we would conduct a strategic review of HighMount, which could include the sale of the company. We are currently evaluating proposals for the sale of HighMount assets and can't say much more about the process at this time. ","Later on in the call, David Edelson, our CFO, will give you more details on the accounting ramifications of moving HighMount to held for sale status. We will be the first to tell you that HighMount is not the most successful investment we\u2019ve ever made. We are certainly not always right but over the years, fortunately we've been more right than wrong. ","Now let\u2019s take a look at about the performance of our other subsidiaries. At CNA, underlying property casualty underwriting results continued to improve. The non-cat accident year loss ratio is down almost 1.5 points versus the same quarter last year. CNA's property casualty business continues to trend in the right direction, albeit at a slower pace than I would like. While CNA's specialty is performing well and producing strong accident year underwriting results and favorable prior year development, CNA commercial\u2019s progress has been more measured, being hampered by certain lines of business that the company is exiting or re-underwriting. The impact of these course corrections will take time to say. ","The sale of Continental Assurance Company closed last week, CNA's long-term care run-off business now comprises the vast majority of CNA\u2019s life and group segment. Long term care results for the first of 2014 have improved over prior years. However in this line of business, two quarters of results does not necessarily constitute a trend. CNA is trying to build on these improving results and is actively managing the business. ","Turning to Diamond Offshore. The outlook for the offshore drilling market remains uncertain. This market has become more competitive as rigs enter the worldwide fleet and oil companies reduce their exploration and production spending to improve cash flow. My sense is that over the next several years, oil companies will start to take advantage of reduced day rates as well as the softening of other services costs and that rig demand will subsequently increase. ","Diamond maintains the highest credit ratings than any offshore driller in the industry and it\u2019s prepared to capitalize on whatever market conditions may prevail. We\u2019re pleased to report that Diamond has negotiated a 9-month contract with Murphy Oil for a third drillship, the Ocean BlackRhino at a day rate of $550,000 a day. This charter will in effect substitute the BlackRhino for the Ocean Confidence, which is undergoing an extensive special survey. Murphy will have an option to convert this contract into a multi-year term. ","Over the past several years, Diamond has committed to the construction of four new drillship, the construction of a new harsh environment semi-submersible rig and the reconstruction of two older semi-submersibles. All these rigs, with the exception of one drillship, are now contracted at attractive day rates. ","Moving on to Boardwalk. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, the natural gas industry remains in a period of transition as shale plays continue to develop and transform gas flows in the United States. The good news is that this transformation is creating attractive investment opportunities to expand Boardwalk\u2019s existing pipeline infrastructure. However these opportunities will not bear fruit overnight. This process will take some time and patience. ","As Stan Horton mentioned on the Boardwalk call earlier today, he is encouraged by the deal flow that he is seeing. Boardwalk\u2019s assets are either attached to, or located near many diversified shale plays. They\u2019re also located near major natural gas users, such as proposed gas-fired power generation and petrochemical plants and LNG export facilities. Boardwalk\u2019s proximity to these shale plays and demand drivers is positively impacting its ability to take advantage of opportunities and make attractive investments. ","Earlier today, Boardwalk highlighted that it is pursuing projects which represent approximately 2 billion cubic feet per day of demand. Most of these projects involve repurposing existing pipeline capacity. These include projects which came about due to the increased demand to transport Marcellus and Utica shale gas supplies from north to south. ","Additionally, Boardwalk southeast market expansion goes into service in the fourth quarter of this year and will transport natural gas to growing areas of demand, including the industrial and power generation markets in Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. All of these investment opportunities result from increased natural gas supplies in the United States and should benefit Boardwalk as natural gas production continues to increase in the coming years. ","Last but not least, let\u2019s turn to Loews Hotels & Resorts. Loews Hotels has been focused on growing its brand and broadening its consumer base through the addition of new properties in gateway cities. Additionally, the company is reaping the benefits of the extensive renovations completed over the past year. In the last three years, Loews Hotels has acquired properties in Boston, Washington DC, Minneapolis, Los Angeles and most recently in Rosemont, Illinois near the O'Hare airport. ","Loews Hotels is also developing the 400-room Loews Chicago Hotel that is scheduled to open in early 2015. These properties expand Loews Hotels\u2019 footprint while maintaining the four plus star quality that is customers know and expect. ","And finally, Loews Hotels continues to build on its 15 year relationship with Universal Studios in Orlando. In late June, we opened the final phase of our first three star product, 1800-room Cabana Bay Beach Resort. Early results are positive and our three original hotels continue to perform well. Book soon if you want a room.","At the Loews Holding company, we ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.9 billion. The company has also repurchased 3.9 million shares of Loews common stock in the second quarter and 2.45 million shares since July 1. The company spent $302 million on the 6.9 million shares repurchased in this year. ","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to David. ","David Edelson","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the second quarter of 2014, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $303 million or $0.79 per share, compared to $261 million or $0.67 per share last year. Net income, which includes a loss of $187 million from discontinued operations, was $116 million for the quarter. ","Let me spend a moment on discontinued operation. As Jim mentioned, in May, we announced that HighMount is pursuing strategic alternative, including a potential sale of the business. We initiated a process during the quarter that we expect will result in the sale of HighMount. Accordingly HighMount assets and liabilities have been reclassified as held for sale as of June 30, 2014 and are reported at estimated fair value, based mainly on market response to date. The associated impairment, together with the results of operations of HighMount have been classified as discontinued operation. ","During the second quarter, Loews recognized an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $192 million related to HighMount, which includes an impairment loss of $167 million to reflect the excess carrying value of HighMount over its estimated fair value. Additionally, this impairment loss reflects certain estimated exit and disposal costs. We expect that the impairment will be subject to subsequent adjustment, which could be positive or negative as the sale process reaches its conclusion. HighMount\u2019s operating results are also included in discontinued operations and will continue to be until the close of the transaction. ","Finally, discontinued operations in the second quarter included after-tax income of $5 million from Continental Assurance Company, CNA's run-off annuity and pension deposit business. As Jim mentioned, the sale of CAC closed last week. ","For the six months ended June 30, 2014, income from continuing operations was $568 million or $1.47 per share as compared to $583 million or $1.49 per share in the prior year period. CNA's contribution to income from continuing operations, including net realized losses, was $235 million in the second quarter of 2014 versus $172 million last year. The main positive factors impacting CNA's year-over-year increase were improved result in CNA specialty business and in its life and group segment, together with a one-time curtailment gain from the elimination of certain postretirement medical benefits. Offsetting these positives were lower earnings in CNA Commercial, stemming from unfavorable prior year development. ","Additionally, CNA's second quarter earnings in 2013 benefited from a legal settlement attributable to CNA Commercial. ","Diamond Offshore\u2019s contribution to income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2014 was $42 million, compared to $87 million in the prior year quarter. Diamond\u2019s year-over-year earnings decrease was primarily due to reduced contract drilling revenues as diamond experienced more rig downtime because of scheduled surveys and rigs being sacked [ph]. Higher contract drilling expenses relating mainly to the surveys also contributed to the profit decline. ","Boardwalk Pipeline\u2019s contribution to income from continuing operations was $17 million in this year\u2019s second quarter as compared to $22 million in Q2 2013. Boardwalk income was basically flat year-over-year, excluding gains on the sale of operating gas, which were significant in last year\u2019s second quarter. ","I would also note that last week, Loews entered into a 10-year $300 million subordinated debt agreement with Boardwalk, under which Boardwalk has the right to borrow at any time until year-end 2015. The purpose of this facility is to help Boardwalk finance various growth projects. ","Loews Hotels & Resorts contributed $5 million to income from continuing operations, up from 1 million in the second quarter of 2013. The earnings improvement was driven by a 12% year-over-year increase in RevPAR in owned and joint venture hotels, with much of the improvement coming from properties that have recently undergone renovation. ","Holding company cash and investments at quarter end totaled $4.9 billion as compared to $5 billion at the end of March. We received $135 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the second quarter of 2014 which breaks down as follows: $61 million from CAN, $61 million from Diamond, and $13 million from Boardwalk. ","During the first half of 2014, we received $512 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, up from $364 million for the first half of 2013. As a reminder, CNA paid a $1 per share special dividend during this year's first quarter. ","In terms of returning capital to Loews\u2019 shareholders, we paid $24 million in cash dividends during the second quarter of 2014 and spent $171 million buying back 3.9 million shares of Loews common stock. We continue to repurchase shares after the quarter ended. From July 1 through August 1, we bought back a further 2.45 million shares of Loews common stock for $107 million. ","I will now hand the call back to Jim.","James Tisch","Thank you, David. Before we open up the call for the questions, I wanted to add that over the last few years the industries in which our subsidiaries operate have certainly witnessed tremendous changes. We all know that change brings both risk and importantly opportunity. Our experience with HighMount unquestionably has been disappointing, we believe that each of our other subsidiaries, CAN, Boardwalk, Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels have real opportunities ahead that should in the long-term benefit all Loews shareholders. ","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mary. ","Mary Skafidas","Thank you, Jim. Lorri, at this time we\u2019d like to open the call up for questions. Can you please give participants instructions on how to do that?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Michael Millman of Millman Research Associates.","Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates","Thank you. Assuming that you are able to dispose HighMount roughly we have it on the books, would that actually create a tax loss that you could use if you decided to sell some other assets?","James Tisch","Mike, I don\u2019t want to comment that at what price we might be selling HighMount. But yes, we would expect that the sale to generate additional tax benefits that we should be able to utilize in the future. ","Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates","And also again what\u2019s your plan on -- assuming you sell with the cash proceeds in the near-term","James Tisch","We have no plans. We currently have $4.9 billion. For the past several quarters we\u2019ve had roughly $5 billion and as I am fond of saying over a long period of time we don't let cash burn a hole in our pockets.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Jim, can you talk a little bit about the bond market right now and what you're doing \u2013 and are you concerned, are there opportunities \u2013 ","James Tisch","To quote myself, I think from sometime before, the yield is too darn low. The yield on 10-year note right now is about 2.5%, inflation is about 2% based on the CPI and in a normal world you would expect to see a 10-year note probably 150 to 250 basis points higher than the current yield. But CNA is in the business of managing a fixed income portfolio. We can\u2019t have all our assets and starks. And we just have to grin and bear it at CNA with respect to the relatively low yields the we\u2019re able to obtain.","For our non-matched portfolio we\u2019re trying to keep that portfolio as short as we can and the benefit of the rolldown in the yield curves as the securities and we owned securities. With respect to our match portfolio, we were fortunate enough a year ago at this time to be buying a lot of municipal bonds which have worked to be very attractive investments for us. We were able to lots of securities with four, five and thin-film 6% coupons and those have gone up dramatically in pricing, have been used \u2013we pre-bought those securities because it was such a good margin and have been using that to fund some of our match liabilities. ","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Is there anything that you can do with derivatives to protect yourself from rising rates?","James Tisch","Not really. CNA has the ability and intent to hold securities surprise recovery. So we just don't worry about it. ","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the call to Mary Skafidas just for anything or closing remarks.","Mary Skafidas ","Thanks, Lorri and thank you for all joining our call.

Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Loews Corporation Quarter Three 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will open the call for your questions.","It is now my pleasure to hand over program over to Mary Skafidas. Please go ahead.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Kristen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Loews Corporation's quarterly conference call. A copy of our earnings release, earnings supplement and company overview may be found on our website, loews.com.","On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Edelson. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward-looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those made or implied in any forward-looking statements due to a wide range of risks, uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings.","Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is only a brief summary of the company's statutory forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included in the company's filings with the SEC. During the call today, we might also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our security filings and earnings supplement for a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.","In a few minutes, our CFO, David Edelson will walk you through the key drivers for the quarter. However, before he does, Jim Tisch, our CEO, will kick off our call. Jim, over to you.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. This quarter I'd like to focus primarily on Loews Hotels and the latest developments that are going on there. But before I do, I want to give a brief update on the impact of hurricanes, Irma and Harvey, on Loews' subsidiaries in Houston and Florida.","First and foremost, we're counting our blessings that all our employees are safe and fully accounted for. But of course, many were severely affected by these catastrophic storms. We're hoping to provide support to those employees and their families and happy to report that Boardwalk, Diamond Offshore, and Loews Hotels were minimally impacted from an operations perspective.","Our CFO, David Edelson, will share details later in our call about the impact that these storms have had on CNA and its results. But I would be remiss if I didn't highlight how well the company has navigated this challenging, catastrophe-filled quarter. CNA's posted net operating income of $159 million despite losses from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the company's capital position actually improved during the quarter.","And now on to Loews Hotels. Over the last two years, Loews Hotels has experienced dynamic growth. At the end of 2015, we had 23 hotels with almost 11,500 rooms. Since then, 2 hotels have been sold and we have opened and\/or committed to opening 7 new hotels, which will add about 5,000 keys to our room count. Even while the chain has been expanding, operating margins have been increasing steadily. Additionally, Jon Tisch step back into his role as CEO of Loews Hotels last fall, just in time to leave this charge. There is no one we trust more at the helm.","Notwithstanding the company's impressive growth, the hospitality industry is facing an increasingly challenging environment. For almost a decade, the hotel industry has seen consistent top line growth, but in many markets supply is now outpacing demand and RevPAR growth has decelerated. Social media, instant availability of information, distribution intermediaries, mobile devices and the sharing economy, all exert pressure on a hospitality industry. Simultaneously, hotel companies have consolidated into industry behemoths with economies of scale pressuring smaller operators.","So, how is Loews Hotels addressing this host of challenges? The company's strategy is twofold. First, we are concentrating on highly-profitable, distinguished hotels in the upper upscale market. Properties that cater to group business and are therefore better able to withstand disruptors such as the sharing economy and technological disintermediation. These hotels typically have 300 to 800 rooms along with significant meeting space; properties such as the Loews Chicago Hotel, the Loews Vanderbilt Hotel in Nashville, and the Loews Miami Beach Hotel.","Secondly, Loews Hotels continues to seek out partners who come to the party with properties that have unique built-in demand generators, similar to what we have done so successfully in our long-term partnership with Orlando Resorts \u2013 with Universal Orlando Resorts. This strategy of growth in immersive destinations leverages our demonstrated success at managing themed concepts, exemplified by our one-of-a-kind destinations such as the Hard Rock Hotel and the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, both in Orlando.","Our partnership with Universal began almost 20 years ago with a joint venture in the first three hotels on the theme park campus. Today, Loews Hotels in partnership with Universal has five hotels and 5,600 rooms in Orlando, and we'll open our sixth property in the summer of 2018, the 600-room Aventura Hotel, and there's more to come. In the next several weeks, the partnership plans to announce a project that will be our largest investment so far in Orlando in terms of both rooms and dollars. So, stay tuned.","Our initial three-hotel investment in the Orlando joint venture has yielded spectacular returns and the properties continue to flourish. The second phase of our expansion in Orlando occurred in 2014, with the opening of the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, a 2,200-room hotel that has already recouped much of its initial investment. During 2016, we opened the Loews Sapphire Falls Resort Hotel with a 1,000 guest rooms, and connected it to the Loews Royal Pacific to create a combined 2,000-room complex with nearly 250,000 square feet of meeting space.","All our properties on the Universal campus consistently deliver occupancy rates and room rates well above their competition, meaning that our RevPAR there is market-leading. Universal has been an outstanding partner and our joint ventures have been a great investment for both of us, and our expectation is that it will continue to be so. Separating apart from Orlando, over the last several months, we have announced three additional new hotel projects that have great promise.","The first hotel fits nicely into the part of our core strategy that focuses on group business. It's the 800-key Loews Kansas City hotel. This hotel, which will open in 2020, will be physically connected to the Kansas City Convention Center, which we believe will drive healthy group demand. This property will be the first new major hotel in Kansas City in over 30 years.","The second and third new projects under development fits squarely into our immersive destination strategy. Together with The Cordish Companies, Loews Hotels has announced a new partnership called Live! by Loews. The first two such properties will be located in Arlington, Texas and in St. Louis, Missouri, and will open in 2019 and 2020 respectively. These properties are adjacent to the major sports arenas in those cities as well as being located in The Cordish Companies' entertainment districts.","In St. Louis, we'll partner with the St. Louis Cardinals; and in Arlington, we'll join forces with the Texas Rangers. Both teams have a deep-rooted fan base and we look forward to welcoming them to our new best-in-class assets, but have no fear these hotels will do plenty of business on non-game nights too. The stadiums and the Cordish entertainment districts will host many concerts and events throughout the year, and our hotels will include significant meeting space, making these ideal destinations for groups and transient customers looking for a unique immersive experience.","These three new hotels are all development projects. Why have we focused more on building versus buying? It's simple. First, when you build something, you get exactly what you want. Second, we think the returns are great. We typically look to greenlight projects with mid-teen cash-on-cash returns on equity. And third, Loews Hotels is both an owner and an operator, a business model that is increasingly rare for hotel companies.","This makes us an attractive partner for developers, immersive destination owners and municipalities alike. We think like owners because we are owners, which creates mutually beneficial partnership dynamics for all constituents, something Loews Hotels has prided itself on for almost 60 years that we've been in the business.","We're pleased with the growth and the growth prospects at Loews Hotels. The company's flexibility, its agile operating philosophy and its willing and ability to invest in its projects, all represent competitive advantages. Over the coming years, we will continue to leverage our strong competitive standing in the industry and seek to invest in projects with above-market returns as well as cultivating new and existing partnerships. We're confident in Loews Hotels' strategy, its leadership and the company's ability to create value for our shareholders over the long term.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $157 million or $0.46 per share, down from $327 million or $0.97 per share in last year's third quarter. Page 17 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key quarterly and year-to-date drivers. Two principal factors caused the $170 million year-over-year decline in our third quarter net income.","Catastrophe losses at CNA, related largely to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, reduced our third quarter net income by a $170 million. Last year, the negative impact of catastrophes was only $10 million. Additionally, both CNA and Diamond incurred debt redemption charges during the quarter, which combined to reduce our net income by $35 million. Absent CNA's catastrophe losses and the debt redemption charges, our pro forma net income was $362 million, up 7% from last year's third quarter.","Now for more on CNA. The company had a strong quarter operationally, which isn't obvious from the $178 million year-to-year decline in CNA's contribution to our third quarter net income. Let me say a bit more about CNA's catastrophe losses and debt redemption charge before highlighting the company's continued underwriting progress.","CNA is in the insurance business, so catastrophe losses are par for the course. The good news is that CNA's losses were very much in line with, if not somewhat below, its market share in the affected areas. We believe this highlights the company's strong risk management. Overall, CNA incurred $269 million pre-tax of catastrophe losses in the quarter versus only $16 million in Q3 2016. As previously mentioned, these cat losses reduced our net income by a $170 million this quarter as compared to $10 million last year.","Now for the debt redemption charge. During the quarter, CNA issued $500 million of tenure notes and redeemed $350 million of notes due in November 2019. This early redemption generated a $42 million pre-tax charge at CNA, which reduced its contribution to our net income by $24 million. Absent the catastrophe losses and the debt redemption charge, CNA's contribution to our net income would have been $324 million, up slightly from the prior year. CNA's underwriting results continue to show real progress in the quarter. Its combined ratio before cat losses and prior-year development improved 2.9 points from the prior year from 97.5% down to 94.6%.","Additionally, the company booked a hefty 7.4 points of favorable prior-year development, slightly lower than last year's 8 points, but still extremely positive. So overall, excluding catastrophes but including prior-year development, CNA's combined ratio for the quarter was 87.2% as compared to 89.4% last year.","Two more CNA observations. Number one, net investment income was down slightly year-over-year mainly due to slightly lower, but still quite positive LP returns. And number two, realized gains on the investment portfolio which flow through net income, were higher last year than this year. Together, these two items accounted for a $29 million negative year-to-year net income variance for Loews.","Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed $6 million to our net income this quarter, about the same as last year. During the third quarter, Diamond issued $500 million of eight-year notes and redeemed $500 million of notes scheduled to come due in May 2019. This redemption generated a $35 million pre-tax charge which reduced Diamond's contribution to our Q3 net income by $11 million. Absent this debt redemption charge, Diamond's contribution to our net income would have been $17 million, up $10 million from the prior year.","Diamond's effective tax rate can differ materially across quarters. So let me comment instead on its pre-tax income, which was down 9% excluding the debt redemption charge. Contract drilling revenues were up about 5% from the prior year and depreciation was also favorable because of prior-period rig impairments. However, these positives were offset by higher expenses, mainly contract drilling expenses as well as higher interest expense, as some interest was capitalized during last year's third quarter before the Ocean GreatWhite went on contract. As you know, the offshore drilling market remains extremely challenging. Diamond is laser-focused on maintaining its strong liquidity profile and maximizing its operating cash flow.","On to Boardwalk, which posted excellent results in the quarter. The company's operating revenues net of fuel and transportation expenses were up almost 3%. EBITDA was up 9% and net income was up 48%. Boardwalk's contribution to our net income was $17 million versus $14 million in Q3 2016. Its contribution would have been $21 million this quarter, if not for a state tax-related deferred tax true-up booked at the Loews level.","Boardwalk's $1.2 billion of growth projects are on time and on budget and are backed by long-term fixed-fee firm contracts. Results at Loews Hotels improved year-over-year as pre-tax income rose 132% and adjusted EBITDA was up about 13%. The company's five properties at the Universal Orlando Resort, propelled these improvements as did the Loews Miami Beach, which was under renovation during last year's third quarter. Earnings were negatively affected this year by lagging results at a few of the company's group-oriented hotels, caused mainly by renovation activity and a shift in the holiday schedule.","In keeping with Jim's focus on Loews Hotels, we have added information about this business to our quarterly earnings supplement, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted debt. These non-GAAP metrics quantify the pro rata EBITDA and mortgage debt attributable to Loews Hotels. We disclosed these metrics in part because GAAP joint venture accounting makes it difficult for investors to understand the underlying earnings power of Loews Hotels portfolio of joint venture properties. To answer an anticipated question, we do not plan to begin providing property-by-property detail. That said, we hope to provide useful color on Loews Hotels' results in future quarters.","Turning to the parent company. Pre-tax net investment income was $48 million, up from $36 million last year and just $2 million last quarter. Equities drove the year-over-year improvement, offset in part by alternatives and gold-related securities. The improvement from last quarter was attributable predominantly to alternatives and equities.","And now for our newest subsidiary, Consolidated Container. On page 5 of our earnings release, CCC's revenues are shown in investment income and other and its pre-tax and net income are included in corporate and other. This is the first full quarter that CCC is included in our results, so it's obviously still early days. Overall, CCC is performing well and the company remains solidly on track to deliver attractive double-digit cash-on-cash returns to Loews. On a net income basis, the company essentially broke even during the quarter.","Operationally, CCC experienced some Hurricane Harvey related disruptions in Q3. CCC's management team continues to impress us with its professionalism, operational knowhow, and strategic focus. We will have more to say about CCC during our year-end earnings call. Loews continues to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At September 30, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $5.1 billion, with approximately 65% in cash and short-term investments and the remainder in fixed maturities, marketable equity securities and a diversified portfolio of limited partnership investments.","During the third quarter, we received $86 million in dividends from our subsidiaries; $73 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk.","And with that, I will now hand the call back to Mary.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Wonderful. Thanks, David. Kristen, we're ready to begin the question-and-answer portion of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Hello?","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","How are you doing there? I wanted to ask some questions about incentive compensation and whatnot. It's an interesting sort of year quarter. CNA is doing great, but you can't account for the weather. And so, I want to know how you think about \u2013 obviously, CNA reduced their own compensation scheme and year-over-year you lose money or you lose money a quarter, because by the way the December's an ROE year-to-date, but we're not doing as well as you want to. That affects competition. How should that affect compensation at Loews? Is it purely the performance of the underlying assets, is it the operational performance? What do we think there?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","For the Loews \u2013 incentive compensation?","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. In a year where one of your major assets still maybe performing well, but for some reason lose a significant amount of money due to something like the weather?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So, what I would direct you to do is take a look at our proxy statement, which has a very long and detailed explanation not only of our incentive compensation system, but also of our incentive compensation philosophy. And I think that that's really important. I look at that section often every year to make sure it reflects management's view of how our compensation system works here, and I think that what we have put together while unconventional, really suits us just fine.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And does it reflect these unusual items? I mean, maybe I'll go back and take a look, but maybe what (23:04)","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Let me describe briefly what it is. We have a very collegial group of senior executives here. We are managing here for the intermediate to the long term. We are not managing for an individual year. As I constantly say, our goal is to increase long-term value. And so, the thing that we do not want to do is encourage actions that might lead to spiking earnings in one year or the next, or doing things that might not lead to long-term value, but instead might just lead to a short-term pop.","So we've constructed a compensation system that focuses on generally consistent earnings for senior executives, that compensates them fairly for what they do and generally results in compensation that does not have spikes because of one action or another. By doing that, we have a very collegial group here at the Loews senior management team, because everybody knows that this is a team effort to build value. And additionally, because I think in part of the way our compensation system works, there is absolutely no desire on anybody's part to spike earnings in one year or the next.","And so, it's a system that is different than many other systems. We do give, to senior executives and other Loews' employees, restricted stock units that hopefully will reflect \u2013 hopefully and ultimately will reflect the value that has been created and provide some incentive, not that it's needed, but provide some incentive to the senior executives to focus on long-term value at Loews.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Well, I appreciate that. And on the investments you're making in hotels, how should I think about the impact on 2018, 2019 cash flow?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","In terms of what, I'm sorry?","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","The investments in hotels?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","The investments in Loews Hotels is entirely manageable. Loews Corporation will be providing some of the planned investments, but it's not going to be significant draw on the Loews treasury.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning, Loews.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Good morning.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Good morning, Bob.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","The hotel discussion, I appreciate both the discussion and increased disclosure. When we think about how to value it, I'm just curious what you look at adjusted EBITDA as sort of what I look at. But is there something beyond that like asset value or per room value or off balance sheet, assets that you're generating that we should think of in terms of the valuation?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","So in order to determine the value, I think what you have to do is look at it on a case-by-case basis, right. If you want to do a sum of the parts for Loews Hotels, you've got \u2013 for some hotels, it's fine to look at EBITDA; for a lot of them it is, but you have to understand the marketplace in which they're operating. There are other hotels that for one reason or another might not be earning in one year or multiple years significant EBITDA, but that can nonetheless be worth a lot of money.","So, it's really a difficult job for someone to value all the hotels. It takes a lot of time, attention and focus. Oftentimes, it means going and visiting properties and just understanding what the potential value might be. It's something that really needs to be done by someone who is well immersed in the hotel business, who understands relative values and they should be able to come up with a pretty accurate number of what each of the individual hotels might be worth.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Great. That's very helpful. You said Jon had some challenges in the hotel that he's facing, but that's probably less than what he's facing in his other operation he's involved with these days. Sorry, I had to go there.","David B. Edelson - Loews Corp.","Yeah.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","That's okay.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","On oil, you were \u2013 on the fourth quarter 2015, kudos to you for saying oil was bouncing along in the bottom and I think you threw out somewhere between $60 and $70 as a price in three to five years, and we're more than halfway towards that target. Where does it have to get before we start to see kernels of positive in your businesses?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","First of all, some self-promotion. It's more than half way there. In fact, Brent is already over $60. So as I like to say, I'm going to declare victory and retreat. In terms of what has to happen now for there to be increased investment, I think it's going to happen. And as opposed to the CEO of Diamond Offshore, I think it's going to happen in fact more rapidly than Mark Edwards does.","We allow different executives here to have different views. I think what's going to happen \u2013 what's happened is that there has been an enormous, enormous underinvestment in productive capacity worldwide. It's breathtaking how big that underinvestment has been. And it is my belief, based on study and research that shale oil produced in the United States, we'll not be able to fully supply worldwide oil demand over the next 5 to 10 years that there is a limit to the shale productive capacity in the United States.","I know that that statement may be going against history and the trend so far, but I think that what you will see is that there is a limit to how much shale oil can be produced here. Yes, it can increase by 1 million barrels this year and 1 million barrels next year, and maybe even 1 million barrels for one or two years after that. But at some point in time, shale production will level off in the United States. And then what the world will need is more productive capacity. Typically, that productive capacity can take three to five years to come online. And already for the past 2 1\/2 or 3 years, the world has been seriously under investing in that productive capacity.","So, my overall view is that oil companies need \u2013 major oil companies will be forced by the market to invest in productive capacity. To date, they've had to decide between dividends and capital investing and they've come down squarely on the side of dividends. But it is my guess that with Brent trading over $60 and with WTI at $53 or $54 a barrel, this is going to start to accumulate the cash flow that will enable them to crank up some of their offshore exploration and development projects.","So, while I don't expect a flood of waters this quarter into Diamond Offshore, my guess is that over the coming year or two, the offshore drilling industry will see a significant increase in inquiries for offshore drilling services.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Well, I didn't mean to under-congratulate you, but it's nice to hear that there could be light at the end of the tunnel within a couple of years. Is that what you're saying?","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Yes. Yes, yes. Yes, I think we've seen \u2013 this is not hard to say, I think we've seen the low in oil prices that \u2013 look, that was $27 a barrel, but...","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Fourth quarter 2015 call, yeah.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","Yeah. But most important, I think that I'm starting to hear a bell ringing that investment in productive capacity beyond shale oil is going to start to increase.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Appreciate the answers, Jimmy.","James S. Tisch - Loews Corp.","My pleasure.","Operator","That will conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I will hand the program back over to Mary.","Mary Skafidas - Loews Corp.","Great.
