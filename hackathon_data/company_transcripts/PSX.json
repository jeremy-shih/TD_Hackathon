My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Clayton Reasor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Affairs. Mr. Reasor, you may begin.","C. C. Reasor","","Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to Phillips 66 fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me this morning are Greg Garland, our Chairman and CEO; our CFO, Greg Maxwell; and EVP, Tim Taylor. The presentation material we\u2019ll be using can be found on the IR section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information.","Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor Statement. It\u2019s a reminder that we\u2019ll be making forward-looking comments during the presentation and our Q&A session. Actual results may differ materially from today\u2019s comments, and factors that could cause these results to differ are included here on the second page of the presentation as well as in our filings with the SEC.","With that said, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg Garland for some opening remarks. Greg?","Greg C. Garland","","Thanks, Clayton. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for being with us today. We ended 2013 with a solid quarter. We operated well. It allowed us to capitalize on favorable crude differentials while exporting record volumes of refined products.","Our adjusted earnings for the quarter were $800 million and our cash flow from operations excluding working capital was $1.3 billion. In the fourth quarter we hit a new record, exporting nearly 200,000 barrels a day. Our total export capacity is just over 400,000 barrels per day, up from 285,000 barrels at the end of 2012.","Our full year 2013 adjusted earnings were $3.6 billion, which is down from 2012\u2019s adjusted earnings of $5.3 billion. 2013 was a volatile year in our Refining business. Adjusted earnings for this segment decreased $2 billion compared to 2012. However, in line with our strategy the Midstream, the Chemicals, Marketing businesses, all recorded higher earnings year-over-year.","Operating excellence continues to be a strong focus for us. We believe that we protect and enhance shareholder value by being a leader in personnel safety, process safety, environmental excellence and reliability. During 2013 Phillips 66 DCP Midstream and CPChem were again among the very best in their respective industries.","We believe that our assets are uniquely positioned to benefit from the American energy revolution, and we have a strong portfolio of reinvestment opportunities across our businesses. If you look at 2014 capital budget for Phillips 66, we\u2019ve announced $2.7 billion and we believe this reflects the opportunities that we have, including our share of expected cap spending by DCP, CPChem and WRB, the 2014 capital program is expected to be $4.6 billion. Of this $4.6 billion about 70% is directed towards Midstream and Chemicals opportunities. These businesses drive growth and enterprise value appreciation to infrastructure investment and capturing NGL value uplift.","Our projects such as the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemical complex and the Sweeny NGL fractionator and the LPG export facility are expected to be large contributors of EBITDA, giving us to grow and make more stable and higher-valued segments.","In the next five years we expect Midstream and Chemicals to represent about two-thirds of our company's enterprise value. Final investment decisions for both the NGL frac and the LPG export facility are expected during the first quarter of this year. We\u2019ll start up with the fractionator in mid-2015 and the LPG export facility will follow about a year later.","Our Refining business is attractively situated to capture value from rising U.S. and Canadian crude production. We do expect that average margins over the next five years will be better than the last five years. We\u2019ll continue to run well, optimize, improve returns and limit growth capital in Refining. Cash growth from Refining will be directed towards the higher-valued segments and towards meeting our obligations to the owners of our company. We understand the importance of being a good allocator of capital and we see value in returning capital to our shareholders.","During 2013 we distributed over 50% of operating cash flows in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We continue our commitment to a secure, competitive and growing dividend and we\u2019ve nearly doubled our initial dividend. Our Board has authorized $5 billion of share repurchases. In addition, in December we announced the exchange of Phillips Specialty Products shares for Phillips 66 shares currently held by Berkshire Hathaway. ","This represents approximately 18 million Phillips 66 shares at current prices. And you add that to the 44 million shares outstanding that we\u2019ve repurchased since the spin, was effectively taking in about 10% of the company. In addition, we\u2019ve strengthened the balance sheet, we\u2019ve paid down $2 billion of debt and that takes our debt-to-cap to about 22%.","So we like the opportunities we have before us. We believe we have a portfolio of projects, people and capabilities to play our part in developing the American energy landscape. We\u2019re excited about the plans and the challenges that lie ahead of us in 2014 and beyond and we look forward to seeing you and telling you more about this at our Analyst Meeting in April.","And with that, I'm going to hand the call over to Greg Maxwell to take you through the quarter results.","Greg G. Maxwell","Thanks, Greg. Starting on Slide 4, fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $808 million or $1.34 per share. The only adjustment this quarter is related to moving Phillips Specialty Products Inc. or PSPI to discontinued operations. With excluding changes in working capital and discontinued operations, our cash from operations for the quarter was $1.3 billion. For the quarter we paid $232 million in dividends and we repurchased $644 million or 9.9 million shares of our common stock. On an adjusted basis, our 2013 return on capital employed was 14%.","Slide 5 provides a comparison of our fourth quarter adjusted earnings with the third quarter looking ahead on a segment basis. Compared to the last quarter, our earnings increased were largely driven by improved results from refining. Partially offsetting this are lower earnings from marketing specialties as well as Midstream. I\u2019ll cover each of these segments in more detail later on.","The Midstream segment posted lower earnings this quarter as higher earnings from NGL Operations were more than offset by lower earnings from DCP. The 2013 adjusted return on capital employed for Midstream was 15% and this is based on an average capital employed of $3.2 billion.","Slide 7 shows Midstream\u2019s fourth quarter earnings of $121 million, a decrease of $27 million from last quarter. Transportation made $50 million this quarter, which is pretty much in line with last quarter. However, compared to last year, this business line is up significantly as results now reflect market rates.","DCP Midstream\u2019s earnings decreased by $50 million, primarily due to lower equity gains resulting from DPM\u2019s unit issuances to the public and a long way at lower volumes mainly due to adverse weather impacts. NGL Operations and Other were primarily due to inventory and higher propane margins in sales.","On the next slide we\u2019ll move on to a discussion of our chemical segment. In Chemicals, Olefins and Polyolefins ran well with a global capacity utilization of 95% for the quarter. In addition, the SA&S business successfully completed a planned major turnaround of its benzene unit located in Pascagoula, Mississippi. The 2013 return on capital employed from our chemical segment was 26% and this is based on an average capital employed of $3.8 billion.","As shown on Slide 9, fourth quarter earnings from Chemicals were relatively flat compared to last quarter coming in at $261 million. In Olefins and Polyolefins, earnings were mainly due to higher volumes and increased equity earnings from its Saudi Polymers Company joint venture. Lower earnings from Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics more than offset this improvement as a result of lower production and the cost impacts associated with the planned benzene turnaround in the fourth quarter.","Moving onto Refining, our realized margin was $10.75 per barrel with a market capture rate of 112%. The global crude utilization rate was 92% and our clean product yield was 84%. During the quarter 94% of the company\u2019s U.S. crude slate was advantaged and this compares with 66% last quarter. The increase was largely driven by additional domestic crudes consistently trading at a discount to Brent. We\u2019ll cover this in more detail on Slide 13.","The 2013 adjusted return on capital employed for Refining was 13% and the average capital employed for this segment was $14.3 billion.","Slide 11 provides more detail on Refining\u2019s earnings improvements in the fourth quarter. The Refining segment had earnings of $450 million and this is up from a loss of $2 million last quarter. This increase is mainly due to the higher realized margins in spite of market cracks, dropping an average of 28% worldwide.","In the Gulf Coast, margins improved largely due to product differential as exports and blending activities helped us realize better clean product prices. We also benefited from the fact that the distillate crack increased nearly 30% in the fourth quarter. The increase in the Central Corridor was largely driven by the widening of Canadian differentials as well as improvements due to butane blending into the gasoline pool. Western\/Pacific\u2019s improvement is mainly due to improved clean product yields, product differentials and also secondary product values. ","For the Atlantic Basin, this region was down due to the impact of lower market cracks as well as Bayway having a major scheduled turnaround during the fourth quarter. Other Refining was down this quarter due to scheduled maintenance on the Keystone Pipeline. All available pipeline capacity was used to deliver crude to our refineries. However a lack of surplus capacity prevented us from capturing additional gains.","Next let\u2019s look at our market capture on slide 12. Compared to the market our realized margin improved mainly from feedstock opportunities, most notably in the Central Corridor. In addition, secondary products were less of a negative impact this quarter reducing the margin by $5.54 a barrel, compared with $6.35 last quarter. As captured in the other bar we also benefited from clean product differentials.","During the quarter, we realized better prices on average for clean products compared with the benchmark prices. In addition, as RIN prices moderated, the benefit of resulting lower expenses is reflected in this bar. Slide 13 shows the comparison of advantaged crude runs at our U.S. refineries by quarter for 2013 on the left and for the past three years as shown on the graph on the right.","During the quarter 94% of the Company\u2019s U.S. crude slate was considered advantaged and this compares with 66% last quarter. The 28 percentage point increase reflects the inclusion of other light and medium crudes which have been trading consistently at a discount to Brent. Some examples include HLS, LLS and ANS.","On an annual basis our advantaged crude slate is increased from 62% in 2012 to 74% in 2013. And this is due to processing an additional 118,000 barrels per day of tight oil, additional domestic crudes that consistently trade at a discount to Brent, as well as higher volumes of heavy Canadian crudes.","The decrease in other heavy crude category from 27% in 2012 to 24% in 2013 is attributable mainly through downtime at our Lake Charles and Sweeny refineries this year.","This next slide covers our marketing and specialty segment, or M&S. Worldwide marketing margins were $2.08 per gallon in the fourth quarter and while our Refining segment benefited from reduced RINs costs during the quarter, earnings and M&S decreased due to lower RINs values created by its renewable fuel blending activities.","As previously announced, we planned to exchange PSPI shares for PSX shares that are currently being held by Berkshire Hathaway. At closing, the PSPI balance sheet will include approximately $450 million in cash resulting in a total PSPI value of $1.4 billion.","With the announcement of this transaction, Specialties now primarily includes our lubricants business. Part of moving PSPI results to discontinued operations, their earnings accounted for approximately 30% of our specialties results. The 2013 adjusted return on capital employed from M&S was 27%, on average capital employed of $2.9 billion.","Slide 15 provides some additional details about the M&S segment. Adjusted earnings for M&S in the fourth quarter were $73 million representing $153 million decrease from the third quarter. Marketing and Others earnings decreased $145 million mostly driven by lower RINs values in the U.S. as well as lower margins internationally.","The business unit was also impacted by the third quarter sale of Immingham Combined Heat and Power Plant, or ICHP which had been generating about $15 million to $20 million in quarterly net income. Specialties decreased over the prior quarter was mainly related to lower base oil volumes.","Moving on next to Corporate and Other. This segment includes net interest expense and includes corporate overhead cost, technology and other cost not allocated to our operating segments. Corporate and Other costs were $97 million after-tax for the fourth quarter and this compares with $113 million for the third quarter. The improvement of $16 million was mainly due to tax impacts resulting in a benefit to our corporate segment. Partially offsetting this was an increase in overhead or staff cost as well as other employee benefits.","Moving next to the fourth quarter cash flow. Cash from operations excluding working capital was $1.3 billion. Working capital changes were negative impact this quarter driven mainly from reduced payables. We paid $232 million in dividends, we funded $623 million in capital expenditures and we repurchased $644 million of our shares. We ended 2013 with a cash balance of $5.4 billion, of which $425 million is tied to cash held by our MLP Phillips 66 Partners.","As for our capital structure shown on the next slide, we ended the year with the equity of $22.4 billion and debt at $6.2 billion, and this resulted in a debt-to-capital of 22%. Now after the consideration of our cash balance of $5.4 billion our net debt-to-capital ratio was 3% at the end of the fourth quarter.","Slide 19 shows our sources and uses of cash for the year. We started the year with $3.5 million in cash. During 2013 we generated $6 billion in cash from operations, which was sufficient to fund our capital program, to cover our shareholder distributions and to reduce our debt. Asset sales and ML proceeds provided an additional $1.6 billion of cash resulting in a year-end cash balance of $5.4 billion and again noting that $425 million of this is held by Phillips 66 Partners.","This next slide shows 2013 adjusted earnings by segment. Full year adjusted earnings were $3.6 billion. Midstream, Chemicals and Marketing and Specialties contributed over 60% of 2013\u2019s earnings, an overall increase from 2012. In the coming years as we grow these more stable businesses, earnings from these segments were expected to become a larger contributor to our portfolio.","In Refining despite a volatile commodity environment, this segment generated $1.8 billion in adjusted earnings and $3.8 billion in cash from operations, largely driven by strong results in the Central Corridor. This concludes my discussion of the financial and operational results. Next I'll cover a few outlook items.","In Midstream; specifically DCP, the startup of the Front Range Pipeline, the Goliad Plant and the O'Connor Plant expansion are expected in 2014. In Chemicals; for the first quarter we expect a global O&P utilization rate to be in the low to mid-90s. In Refining; we expect the first quarter global utilization rate to be in the high 80s.","With regard to turnarounds, our pre-tax turnaround expense is expected to be about $400 million to $450 million for 2014 and between $120 million to $160 million in the first quarter.","In Corporate and Other, we expect this segment\u2019s after-tax costs to run between $420 million to $440 million for the year. The total company\u2019s effective tax rate is expected to be in the mid-30s.","And lastly we look forward to telling you about our future growth plans at our 2014 Analyst Meeting being held on April 10 in New York City.","With that we\u2019ll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer-Session","Operator","","At this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) our first question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI Group.","Doug T. Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","","Good morning everybody and congratulations on your results.","","Greg C. Garland","","Thanks Doug.","Doug T. Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","","In the Refining business, and specifically in the West Coast Pacific area, I want to see if we can get an updated strategic and fundamental viewpoint on that business, meaning even if the fundamentals remain lackluster, that is if you think if they will, there seem to be a variety of different strategic options that are available to the Company. And so that\u2019s once if we could get an updated viewpoint towards that business, please?","Greg G. Maxwell","Sure, so I think we said many times that we think that the West Coast is a challenged operating environment, it\u2019s a high cost area to operate \u2013 our assets are good assets, we are on a path to Texas, I would say, as you think about net income positive single-digit return business and how do we get crude advantage to the West Coast. So I think you can ask me in April, we\u2019ll probably tell you more about what we are doing to get advantaged crudes in the California, it\u2019s a combination of investments and third-party as we work that.","And then, I think we said openly that all options to California I think are on the table, in terms of those assets whether it could be a spin or IPO, variable MLP, a joint venture. As you look at the West Coast, we think those are valuable assets ultimately because we have 110,000 barrels a day of coking capacity there. And so those assets in the future will probably work more than what people think they were today is my view.","And I mean that the California market is a big market as everyone knows. We have a continuing interest there, but as we think through the assets or pass the day is to make it better and more profitable. When those assets are well, we don\u2019t see any big capital investments in front of us on the West Coast and so the hold option really cost us nothing. ","Doug T. Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","","Okay, thanks a lot Greg.","Greg G. Maxwell","","You bet Doug thanks.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Hi, good afternoon guys. Can I ask for some more details on the flow improver business sale to Buffett, any detailed metrics on the transaction on a cash flow or EBITDA basis? I mean it\u2019s one of the first potentially more M&A activity given your asset position and optimization approach. Yes, just some more color around the metrics and the rationale driving and how you thought about and analyze that transaction?","Greg C. Garland","Yes, so I\u2019ll start and then Tim can follow through. It\u2019s kind of an asset that we were really actively marketing or really wanted to sell and we\u2019d have it on-again, off-again conversations with Lubrizol, which is one of the Berkshire Hathaway companies about the asset and frankly our exploration levels were high, given that it is a very specialty type business. It had returns exceeding 30% and it certainly fit well in a portfolio from that perspective. We got the talking with Berkshire Hathaway about a proposed transaction and we found a way that we could achieve high value for the asset and at the same time do it very efficiently for both ourselves and Berkshire Hathaway. It really became a must-do deal for us in terms of creating shareholder value for PSX. And so, yes, Tim if you want to go through some of the detail that\u2019s fine.","Tim G. Taylor","","Yes. Evan, when you look at discontinued operations it really highlights that. So that\u2019s a $70 million, $90 million, $100 million EBITDA type of business. So very strong multiple, very tax efficient, good value, good strong business. So I think it was a great way to accomplish value on both sides of that. Yes.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Okay, great. I\u2019ll look at that. And then secondly, you mentioned building more crude by rail offloading at Bayway and Ferndale. Can you give any volume guidance capacity, your capital spend for that in 2014, like how much will you be able to move the assets crude-wise?","Greg C. Garland","Yes, Evan, in Bayway we\u2019re roughly looking at 50,000 a day on unit trains of additional capacity with that. Obviously scheduling the flexibility can impact that. Relatively modest capital amounts tens of millions that never really come out to final number. Ferndale, they\u2019re similar, probably more in the order of 30,000 a day. Bayway would be operational first half of this year we would expect Ferndale to be operational in the second half of the year and both of those will supplement our efforts to other third-party logistics to increase the flow of light crudes into Ferndale and Bayway.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. And maybe lastly, if I just could on the \u2013 I know you just have announced that the Cross-Channel Connector project, I guess Phase 1 and Phase 2 any other details around that on potential EBITDA and\/or the benefit to the refining sector from that connection? Thanks.","Greg C. Garland","Yes, the Cross-Channel Connector goes from our Pasadena terminal on the east side of Houston across their Ship Channel. It allows more logistics connections to other pipelines and terminal assets. So overall it\u2019s got nice volume opportunity on that line. It\u2019s really a short-haul line and I think a lot of the value accrues really from a MLP perspective on that piece, but just as importantly it creates some more commercial opportunities for us, particularly with our Sweeny volumes.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Greg C. Garland","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","","Good morning. You talked about your product export capabilities and now you\u2019ve expanded that to 400,000 barrels a day. I believe that\u2019s more rapid than you had discussed previously. Could you talk about where you\u2019ve been successful there in getting those volumes up and provide a split between the Gulf Coast and other regions?","Greg C. Garland","Yes. It\u2019s primarily Gulf Coast. I think we\u2019ve just been more successful than what we thought in terms of scheduling efficiencies and minor debottlenecking, in terms of pushing more products through. I think in December where we were kind of 250 rate. So I think we\u2019ll continue to push the limits. We\u2019re looking for cheap ways that we can use to get more barrels across there. Certainly we\u2019ve stated our ultimate target is about 500 a day, but almost all that increase is going to be on the Gulf Coast. Minor debottlenecks on the West Coast and then we have underutilized capacity today on the East Coast.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","Got you. And on your Cedar Bayou hexane project, you talked about first half of 2014 in service state, perhaps that\u2019s a little bit of shortage from previous discussions, but could you just provide an update there and what the current margin environment looks like for that asset once it comes on?","Greg C. Garland","","That\u2019s a project still on schedule, on budget, so looking for it in the latter part of first half of this year. So we feel very good about that project and margins are really in line with the guidance we\u2019ve giving in the past, so that 15% to 20% return on a roughly $250 million investment. So it\u2019s a nice increment of growth for the Chemicals business and a fairly high growth, high demand product.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","","Thank you.","Greg C. Garland","You bet.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question on the Gulf again, I mean obviously more of your assets are over on the Louisiana side and the crude production is growing and as you get into your asset, especially with some uplift in earnings which maybe is more balanced already in some of the peers. But are there any logistical issues in getting access that you\u2019re seeing from crude for Texas, I\u2019m thinking, any barge or shipping issues?","Greg C. Garland","","Well, Ed, we\u2019ve put in service now two MR tankers on the crude side. We move Eagle Ford primarily into Louisiana from Texas, but we\u2019ve also taken frankly LLS up to East Coast last quarter as well. So we use that flexibility where it delivers the most value. Overall pipeline has started up and that\u2019s a major connection to the Gulf \u2013 to the west side of the Gulf. And that\u2019s a very positive development in terms of new crude sources. So I think more barges are in service, more options are developing and I think you are going to continue to see a wider selection of domestic crudes available to run in our Louisiana refineries and we\u2019re really taking advantage of that particularly at Alliance and in Lake Charles.","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Right. And then coming to the sort of the LPG, I guess, condensate export facility that you\u2019re building. I guess, down the road you\u2019ve given some guidance on EBITDA and CapEx. Just may be a status update on any permits I think for that, but a broader question is, I mean it doesn\u2019t make sense to sort of add things like condensate splitting capacity at that port facility given the rise of the simple lights that we\u2019re seeing in the system.","Greg G. Maxwell","","So, it\u2019s hard for us. We got the permits on the frac. We\u2019re working the permits on the export facility. It will take a little longer in terms of that. I think in terms of the guidance we\u2019ve been giving on CapEx. We\u2019re still in that range and EBITDA still in that $400 million to $500 million range. We're going to take it. Well, you should expect FID this quarter and we have said that. I think the other thing is we\u2019re doing engineering work on the next frac. We're doing, what I would say is preliminary engineering analysis around the condensate splitter and so you should expect us to start moving those projects forward. We just look at the infrastructure that we have in place at Sweeny and Creek and the geographic location of those assets and they\u2019re just ideally situated for us to capitalize on that.","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","More detailing\u2026","Greg C. Garland","Yes, and we will give you more detail at the Analyst Meeting in April.","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay, yes. And generally across the system, and you have a lighter refining slate than some of the others perhaps with the exception of the West Coast and the Mid-Con area. Are you doing any more investments to sort of \u2013 do you need to do more investments to actually at the plant level access light crude?","Greg C. Garland","Yes, we\u2019re kind of 65-35 light, medium, heavy. We kind of like that configuration given the crudes we see coming at us. We\u2019re always looking for debottleneck opportunities, I mean the Eagle Ford is an interesting crude. We do see limits on processing Eagle Ford, but we\u2019re talking about spending $5 million, $10 million increments to remove those limits to process more Eagle Ford even at light refining like Alliance, for example, but we\u2019ll run about 325 a day or so on the Gulf Coast of light sweet and at this time we don\u2019t envision significant capital investments to change that slate, Ed.","Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Greg C. Garland","You bet.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Greg C. Garland","","Hi, good morning.","","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Greg, I think that there is some news coming out from different news matter talking about your Whitegate and Melaka Refinery up for sale and people looking at that and they have some interest. Is there any update you can provide?","Greg C. Garland","So, yes, at Whitegate we\u2019re kind of in the middle of a process and probably shouldn\u2019t comment too much on that. There is interest in the facility, but you have to context that interest with this dip in Atlantic Basin refinery I would say. And then in Melaka, I think we said that it\u2019s a non-strategic asset and there is a process underway around that, but it\u2019s a process that\u2019s really defined by the formation agreements of the joint venture and so we\u2019re working that. And I think that you should expect that this year, in 2014, we\u2019ll get to decision points on both Whitegate and Melaka.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. That\u2019s great. And one earlier that, I mean you guys provide \u2013 talking about the secondary products, their launch is narrowing and also that their destock [indiscernible] there is two of the really big reason behind the strong refining result. Specifically on the Western Pacific and Central Corridor, those two regions, if we combine to the third quarter can you establish that\u2019s a bit down, what\u2019s the benefit from those two items in those two region sequentially?","","Greg C. Garland","So I think we can kind of go through that at a macro-level. We just start with the West Coast, first of all its pricing was lower. So the hurt was less because the relative spread between the crude price and the secondary products was lower. Fuel prices were looking better and NGL prices were little higher and so that\u2019s the primary driver on that. And then when you get move to Central Corridor, it\u2019s around \u2013 well I think coke was a little better and then of course higher NGL prices drove that also.","","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Is there any kind of number that you can share?","Greg G. Maxwell","","With regard to what aspect of it, Paul?","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. I mean that say just [indiscernible] improvement sequentially on the secondary product, $2 or anything that you can share?","","Greg G. Maxwell","Well, on the secondary products, if I am following you, what we included in the appendix for the Central Corridor for example, the secondary products where a negative impact on a realized margin by $6.27 barrel.","Tim G. Taylor","And I\u2019d say that two-thirds of that Paul is oak.","Greg C. Garland","Oak.","Greg G. Maxwell","That\u2019s right.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","And do you have that number for the third quarter. I\u2019m just looking at sequentially what is the improvement or narrowing in that loss?","Greg G. Maxwell","Yeah, third quarter was $6.35, 2013 right and I would say coke is going to represent two-thirds of that loss in those gains, close $5.54.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Or that maybe \u2013 let me ask you in the other away, if I looking at say sequential in the fourth quarter, is there any sort of one-off operating income, whether it is in an extremely high level of that distract cargo you guys have been able to acquire that you think maybe somewhat unique to the fourth quarter and may not be repeatable into say the first quarter of 2014.","Greg C. Garland","I don\u2019t think so. You know Ponca ran really well and it increased the amount of its domestically produced crudes around Oklahoma and Ponca City. I don\u2019t think there was anything unusual, pretty clean quarter actually. It was not only in Central Corridor but most regions.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Greg G. Maxwell","One of the biggest impacts you can think across is really at Bayway and the turnaround at Bayway if you think about unusual items across the system.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Yeah sorry, chief Ferndale [ph] short one yes, go ahead great.","Greg C. Garland","I was just going to say when you look at the refining results the unusual items that I would think about were a negative impact that had happened in the Atlantic because of the downtime at Bayway and impact at Humber. Those would be the two things I would point to that were kind of unusual for the quarter.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Two really quick one, one, do you have the current market value of the inventory in excess of the bulk, and secondly that because of the way defense or substantially why the defense so in the fourth quarter. I thought that at the refining we had some better results because of trading opportunity, but you still coming with a loss. Is there any thing particularly in the quarter that too a loss and not seeing a profit that what we\u2019ve seen in the other peer advance that defense was really wide?","Greg C. Garland","So let\u2019s do the inventory on for\u2026","Greg G. Maxwell","On the inventory replacement cost at the end of the year, Paul, it was about $7.6 billion.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Greg G. Maxwell","And then I will kick it over to Tim, but you know as we mentioned earlier part in some of our earlier comments, part of the driver was the plant maintenance on the Keystone pipeline coming down out of on the Canada side and I don\u2019t know is there any\u2026","Tim G. Taylor","That\u2019s primarily the difference that we saw.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","I see. Okay very good. Thank you","Tim G. Taylor","Thank you","Greg G. Maxwell","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, hi good morning or good afternoon everybody. In your presentation, obviously you talked about the change in definition I guess of how you see advantaged crudes, just wanted to get a little more detail on that a bit. Are you saying basically that you\u2019ve changed the definition, which means you\u2019re no longer pursuing a more aggressive change in the slate or are you still expecting to have some substitution within that newly defined 94%. I\u2019ve got a couple of follow-ups please.","Greg C. Garland","Okay. The definition really it\u2019s not definition, it\u2019s just the fact that these particularly the Gulf Coast crudes and ANS have consistently traded in the fourth quarter at a significant discount to Brent. And I think that\u2019s a part of our crude slate and we have always said that we expected those crude to discount and when they did they would turn to advantage.","That said, we continue to work on logistic solutions, particularly to the East and the West Coast and to the Gulf Coast and we\u2019re very active in finding ways to substitute one advantage crude for another, particularly with options that we see in the Permian and Mid-Con for crudes that deliver more value to our refining operation. So it\u2019s a very active area for us, both in terms of light, medium and heavy crudes and the logistics and the operating optimization as we go through.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess what I\u2019m trying to understand is that, was it a proactive \u2013 there wasn\u2019t a proactive change in the fleet. It was really more to what the market gave you that the [indiscernible] 94%. Is that the right way I am thinking about it?","Greg C. Garland","I think that\u2019s probably right. I think that in the past we had not included LLS or HLS or ANS to that matter in advantaged crude because it was trading at Brent or better. And what we\u2019re saying is now given that products are priced off a brand and we think that will continue that if the crudes are pricing at consistently at a discount of Brent, we should consider those consider or consider those advantaged.","Now, I don\u2019t think it says that we\u2019re any less aggressive about substituting higher discounted crudes. But your point is correct and that the market is the primary reason why we are considering LLS or HLS or ANS advantage at this point.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Greg. It\u2019s very clear. If I could just go to a quick follow-up please, I don\u2019t hold out a lot of hope in this one, but any change that you can give us a breakdown between Bayway and Europe in terms of its split of earnings in the quarter or the loss in the quarter?","Greg G. Maxwell","You\u2019re right. There is no chance on that one.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay and last one from me is really more of \u2013 kind of big picture issue. I guess correct, you\u2019re often quite hopeful about your support for crude exports in contrast to some of your refining peers. I wonder if you can just give us a quick kind of summary as to why you\u2019re taking that. I will leave it there. Thanks.","Greg C. Garland","Yes, well, thanks. I think first of all, I think I came out in May of 2012 and said, we wouldn\u2019t be opposed to lifting the ban on crude exports. We do encourage a thoughtful and broad conversation around energy policy in our country and I think you got to look at that holistically. It\u2019s not just crude exports, but it\u2019s also infrastructure and actually pipelines that could be marine and I think you just can\u2019t pick one of them and pull it out separately. So we don\u2019t oppose to seeing the crude ban. I think you\u2019ve got to look at RFS, you\u2019ve got to look at infrastructure, whereas pipeline \u2013 can we improve the pipeline or not in this country, all the way to marine infrastructure limitations that we have in this country. So in generally we are free traders, but we\u2019d like to see a free market also.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right and I appreciate the answer. Thanks, Greg.","Greg C. Garland","You bet. Thanks.","Operator","Our final question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Thank you for sliding me in here into the process. I guess, I\u2019d like to may be ask a little more about the Midstream and obviously one of the segments you really want to grow. You\u2019ve talked about at the beginning of the call some of the things starting in 2014, what else can we look for there and what are the sort of expected contributions of those projects?","Greg G. Maxwell","Well certainly as you know our own Midstream business, I would say we\u2019re in engineering investment heavy phase of that. And we see the EBITDA contributions of those investments starting in 2015 and 2016 and this is a very difficult organic build activity. The DCP Midstream has had quite an active capital program over the years, last couple of years and going forward we still see $46 billion of ongoing capital opportunity in front of DCP. ","And so I think we\u2019ve got several pipelines coming on, certainly we got Sands Hills, Southern Hills they are in process and they are ramping up and over the next I say two years maybe three years, we\u2019ll get those products, our pipeline is fully ramped. Of course you have the front range in Texas Express Pipeline this year that will come in. And so we started the Goliad Plant and so we\u2019ve got a host of gathering and processing facilities that will be coming on in 2014 and again these will be helped to fill the pipes that are already constructed and underway.","So I think we feel pretty good about the growth profile in terms of NGLs for DCP. We look at that expect something in the order of 4%, 5%, 6% a year growth in terms of that business, in terms of our expectations of that business. I think we will be able to meet that.","Greg C. Garland","","And then of course you got the additional transportation assets that we would expect to come on this year. The rail unloading facility at Bayway we think happens in the first half, with Ferndale probably second half of this year. There is some additional things that we are doing in transportation. We haven\u2019t been public on yet, probably we want to talk about those in April, but the transportation assets or transportation business line within the Midstream segment will probably contribute EBITDA faster than the NGL business line, NGL investments are going to take a little bit longer to payoff.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Sure and I guess given the exceptionally cold weather and the impact on the pricing especially of propane across the NGL space, how do you look at that as in terms of a net impact on Midstream here in the first quarter. Is there enough positive out of the price moved to offset negative you might see elsewhere in the business with higher prices, any help you can offer or so in that area?","Greg C. Garland","I think in general we would say, first quarter will be directionally positive for us. Ethane continues to \u2013 trying to follow natural gas and trade that at \u2013 like parity with natural gas. And then you\u2019re always going to have what I would say is instantaneous impact of the cold weather and limited infrastructure that is going to make things very volatile going forward.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Yes, we are all aware of volatility that\u2019s for sure. Last question just to sort of a housekeeping issue, the other refining segment was negative in the quarter. Was that attributable to anything in particular or just a function of how things are moving during the quarter?","Greg C. Garland","It\u2019s really a function of how things are moving in and then again that limited \u2013 somewhat limited pipeline space bringing Canadian crudes into the U.S. that at least we can trade around that asset.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay, thank you.","","Greg C. Garland","Thanks.","C. C. Reasor","So I guess that was the last question and I do appreciate everybody\u2019s participation and interest in the Company. All this material will be posted on our website. We will have transcripts available soon and we look forward to seeing a lot of you in April, in New York. Thanks to all. Bye, bye.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is Christine and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Clayton Reasor. You may begin.","Clayton Reasor - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Affairs","Good morning. Welcome to Phillips 66 first quarter earnings conference call. With me this morning are Greg Garland, our Chairman and CEO; Greg Maxwell, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP, Tim Taylor.","The presentation material we will be using this morning could be found on our website in the Investor Relations section along with supplemental, financial and operating information we think you will find helpful.","Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It\u2019s a reminder we will be making forward-looking comments during our prepared remarks and the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we say today and factors that could cause these results to differ are included on the second page of the presentation as well as in our filings with the SEC.","It\u2019s my pleasure now to turn the call over to Greg Garland for some opening remarks. Greg?","Greg Garland - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Clayton. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We are glad you are with us today. We had another solid quarter. Our Midstream and Chemicals businesses have demonstrated their earnings durability during the quarter. We operated well across our businesses in Midstream, Chemicals and Refining. Also in the Refining, we completed our first quarter major turnaround program this month. We strive for operating excellence in everything we do. We think that we protect and enhance shareholder value by getting this part of our jobs right. So, we continue to drive improvements in personal safety, process safety, environmental metrics and reliability.","Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $866 million and we returned $2.2 billion of capital to shareholders. We are making progress in building our higher value businesses. In February, we reached the final investment decision on the Sweeny Fractionator One and the Freeport LPG Export Terminal. And in March, we signed a significant LPG sales contract for this terminal. We expect that the capital spend for these two projects to be just over $3 billion. These investments are examples of how we plan to grow the Midstream business by leveraging on the capability and the infrastructure of our core assets. We have the ability to expand the LPG export facility and we are already looking into other factionator and condensate splitter options.","Also in March, PSXP made its first post-IPO acquisition. It purchased the Gold Line product systems and two refinery-grade propylene storage spheres, which are located in Medford, Oklahoma. These were acquired from PSX for $700 million. This acquisition is expected to almost double the partnership\u2019s annual EBITDA. The assets currently in Phillips Partners are key connectors to five of Phillips 66\u2019s core operating refineries. Our intent is to get PSXP to scale. So, it will have the balance sheet and the capability to be able to co-invest and ultimately invest in its own Midstream opportunities.","In Chemicals, CPChem broke ground on its U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals project, which it consist of a 3.3 billion pound per year ethane cracker and two polyethylene facilities, each with an annual capacity of 1.1 billion pounds. CPChem is the first to start construction on a new major U.S. Gulf Coast petchem project and expect the startup to be in 2017. In addition, CPChem\u2019s 1-Hexene project and a small specialty chemicals expansion in Belgium are expected to startup during the second quarter this year.","Regarding refining, we continue to find ways to provide crude supply optionality to our refineries. At the Bayway refinery, we have a 70,000 barrel per day rail rack, which is expected to come online in the second quarter and our Ferndale refinery at 30,000 barrel a day rail rack will start up later this year. We have ordered another 1,200 railcars that will be dedicated to crude in addition to the 2,000 we already have in service. We expect to start receiving additional cars this summer and by early next year will increase our crude by rail capacity to about 160,000 barrels per day.","We have also reached agreements with several third-party logistics companies to deliver more advantage crude to our refineries. We have secured 20,000 barrels a day of rail loading capacity in Hardisty, Alberta and 10,000 barrels a day in Casper, Wyoming all focused on Canadian crude. Both of these facilities will be operational later this year. In addition, we have 20,000 barrels a day agreement with Plains in Bakersfield, California to put advantage crudes into their pipeline system for delivery to our refineries. This facility will also be commissioned later this year.","For pipelines, we have entered into an agreement providing more access deep into the Eagle Ford. We have secured 30,000 barrels a day of turn space on the South Texas Crude Pipeline, which includes capacity through Corpus Christi marine terminal further enabling us to ship Eagle Ford to our Gulf and East Coast refineries via our Jones Ax vessels. In addition, this agreement complements the commitment we already have on the Kinder Morgan Pipeline that supplies up to 65,000 barrels a day of Eagle Ford to Sweeny.","We believe that returning capital to our shareholders is fundamental for creating value. And it\u2019s an important part of or strategy. Since the formation of Phillips 66, we have returned $6 billion to our shareholders. This includes $3.2 billion in share repurchases, $1.4 billion for the PSPI exchange, and we have almost doubled our dividend. Our board has authorized $5 billion in share repurchases. We have $1.8 billion remaining. Through this first quarter, we have purchased about 42 million net shares and with the PSPI exchange, we have reduced our outstanding shares by close to 10%.","As we disclosed in our Analyst Meeting, we expect 40% of our capital allocation to be for shareholder distributions, while reinvesting 60% back into our businesses. Including our share of expected capital spending by DCP, CPChem and WRB, over the next three years, our capital program is expected to be $16 billion with over 70% directed towards Midstream and Chemicals opportunities.","So, with that, I am going to hand the call over to Greg Maxwell, who will take you through the quarter results. Greg?","Greg Maxwell - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone. We start on Slide 4. First quarter adjusted earnings were $866 million or $1.47 per share, a $696 million non-cash gain recognized in the exchange of Phillips Specialty Products, or PSPI was the main adjustment to our earnings this quarter. In addition, consistent with last quarter, PSPI results were included in discontinued operations and as such are not part of our discussion today. Adjusted cash from operations for the quarter were $1 billion. We will cover this in more detail when we get to the cash flow chart. For the quarter, we paid $229 million in dividends and we repurchased 8.4 million shares of our common stock for $640 million. We also took yet another 17.4 million shares through the PSPI exchange. On an adjusted basis, our annualized 2014 return on capital employed was 13%.","Slide 5 provides the comparison of our first quarter adjusted earnings with last year\u2019s fourth quarter on a segment basis. Compared to last quarter, our earnings increase of $58 million was driven by improved results in Midstream, Chemicals as well as Marketing and Specialties. I will cover each of these segments in more detail later on.","The Midstream segment posted higher earnings this quarter compared with the fourth quarter as all of our Midstream businesses had improvements. The annualized 2014 adjusted return on capital employed for Midstream was 22% and this is based on an average capital employed of $3.5 billion.","Slide 7 shows Midstream\u2019s first quarter earnings of $188 million, an increase of $67 million from last quarter. Transportation made $62 million this quarter and this is up from last quarter due to higher throughput fees and higher railcar rates. Operating costs were lower as well contributing to the improved earnings. DCP Midstream\u2019s earnings increased by $46 million primarily due to equity gains from DPM\u2019s unit issuances to the public, lower operating costs, and also higher natural gas and NGL prices. In addition, our NGL business line was also improved due to stronger propane prices.","In Chemicals, CPChem ran well overall. The global Olefins and Polyolefins capacity utilization rate for the quarter was 93% and benefited from stronger margins, while the SA&S business was able to capture higher earnings following the last quarter\u2019s benzene turnaround. The annualized 2014 return on capital employed from our Chemicals segment was 30% and this is based on average capital employed of $4.2 billion.","As shown on Slide 9, first quarter earnings for Chemicals were $316 million and this represents a record quarter for our Chemicals business. In Olefins and Polyolefins, earnings were up mainly due to improved realized O&P chain margins and higher earnings from CPChem\u2019s equity affiliates and this was partially offset by lower ethylene volumes. The $29 million improvement in Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics was primarily due to higher benzene production from the absence of turnaround activity completed in the fourth quarter of last year as well as stronger margins in the first quarter.","Moving on to refining, our realized margin was $9.88 per barrel, the global utilization rate was 90% and our clean product yield was 84%. The annualized 2014 adjusted return on capital employed for refining was 9% and again this is based on an average capital employed of $13.5 billion. The Refining segment had earnings of $306 million and this is down from last quarter\u2019s earnings of $418 million. This decrease is mainly due to lower volumes as a result of plant turnaround and maintenance activities as well as overall weaker realized Refining margins.","The Atlantic Basin region was up as Bayway was back on line following a major scheduled turnaround last quarter this allowed us to capture the higher crack spread in this region. In the Gulf Coast, earnings were down largely due to plant turnaround at our Alliance Refinery. The decrease in the Central Corridor was mainly driven by the narrowing of Canadian crude differentials as well as downtime at the Borger and Wood River refineries. Western Pacific\u2019s decrease is primarily due to narrowing crude differentials of domestic shale crudes relative to ANS and plant turnaround activity at our San Francisco facilities.","Other refining had a positive earnings impact of $38 million this quarter compared to a loss of $49 million last quarter. The first quarter earnings were largely driven by improved commercial results and lower cost.","Next, let\u2019s look at our market capture on Slide 12. Compared to the market, our realized margin was 79% this quarter. This is down from 109% in the fourth quarter. On a regional level, the biggest movements were in the Central Corridor and the Western Pacific regions and you can find additional regional information in the appendix.","As many of you know, our refineries are configured to produce more distillate than the marker assumes. With the overall strength in the crack spread more weighted towards gasoline than diesel this quarter, our configuration was a negative impact compared with the market. The secondary products losses of $5.14 were lower by $0.40 per barrel this quarter compared to the fourth quarter and this was driven mainly by improved NGL prices in the Central Corridor.","The positive feedstock impact of $4.18 was about $0.40 per barrel less than last quarter and this is largely resulting from the overall narrowing of crude differentials. The largest swing compared to last quarter is another. The $0.91 per barrel negative impact shown on the chart compares to a positive impact of $1.52 per barrel last quarter. Included in other are impacts from product realizations, inventory and RINs. These first two items were the main drivers for the change due to the seasonal activities. We had negative inventory impacts this quarter as we built inventories compared to inventory draws in the fourth quarter and claim product differentials were less favorable as blending of intermediates of butanes were reduced.","Slide 13 shows the comparison of advantage crude runs at our U.S. refineries by quarter on the left and by year on the right. During the quarter 91% of the company\u2019s U.S. crude slate was considered advantaged and this compares with 94% last quarter. The decrease was mainly due to processing less coastal domestic crudes in the Gulf Coast due to planned turnaround activity and also lower heavy crudes in the Central Corridor region. These decreases were partially offset by increases of Bakken crude that processed at our Bayway refinery.","This next slide covers our Marketing and Specialty segment or M&S. Worldwide marketing margins were $3.07 per gallon in the first quarter. Our specialties business had lower margin and we will cover this in more detail in the next slide.","However, before we move on I want to make you aware of a reporting change we made impacting both the Refining and the M&S segments. Specialties previously only included our finished lubes business, but effective January 1, 2014, we moved a Base Oil joint venture as well as the commission revenues related to the needle and anode coke into this business line. These specialty businesses were previously reported in refining. We have also made these changes retrospectively so that our prior period results reflect these changes. In addition, as mentioned earlier PSPI results are reported in discontinued operation versus being included in the M&S segment.","The annualized 2014 adjusted return on capital employed from M&S was 22% on average capital employed of $2.4 billion. Slide 15 provides some additional detail about the M&S segment. Adjusted earnings for M&S in the first quarter were $137 million representing a $32 million increase from the fourth quarter. The increase is driven from earnings in marketing and other largely due to improved U.S. margins that were partially offset by higher costs and lower volumes. During the quarter, our refined product exports totaled 139,000 barrels per day, down from 197,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. This decrease is mainly driven by the Alliance Refinery turnaround as well as more attractive inland prices. Specialties earnings were $44 million this quarter, a $7 million decrease from the fourth quarter. This decline reflects lower Base Oil margins partly offset by improved lubricants margin.","Moving on to Corporate and Other, this segment includes net interest expense, it includes Corporate overhead costs and it also includes technology and other costs not allocated to our operating segments. Corporate and Other costs were $81 million after-tax for the first quarter and this compares with $97 million last quarter. The improvement of $16 million was partly due to lower environmental accruals and tax impacts.","Moving next to our first quarter cash flow, starting on the left adjusted cash from operations was $1 billion. Note that this excludes working capital and the impacts of the WRB special distribution. Adjusted working capital changes were a negative impact this quarter largely due to building inventory. The $1.2 billion special distribution from WRB resulted from Cenovus prepaying its partnership contribution obligation to the joint venture. During the quarter, we funded $572 million in capital expenditures and we paid $229 million in dividends. In addition, we repurchased $640 million of our shares through the share repurchase program and an additional $450 million of cash was associated with the PSPI share exchange. And we ended the quarter with the cash balance of $5.3 billion.","As for our capital structure shown on the next slide we ended the quarter with equity of $21.8 billion in debt at $6.2 billion resulting in a debt to capital ratio of 22%. After taking into consideration our ending cash balance of $5.3 billion, our net debt to capital ratio was 4% at the end of the quarter.","This concludes my discussions of the financial and operational results. I will now cover a few outlook items. In Midstream, DCP Midstream has started work to build the Zia II plant, a 200 million cubic feet per day sour natural gas processing plant that\u2019s located in the Permian Basin region. For the second quarter, we expect global utilization rates for both Chemicals O&P and refining to be in the mid-90s. With regard to turnarounds, our pretax turnaround expenses is expected to be about $400 million to $450 million for 2014 and about $70 million in the second quarter. In Corporate and Other, we expect this segment\u2019s after-tax cost to run about $100 million per quarter. And the overall effective income tax rate is expected to be in the mid-30s for the second quarter.","With that we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Jeff Dietert of Simmons. Please go ahead.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons","Good morning.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons","Westlake announced its plans to drop three ethylene plants in an MLP and I was just curious if you could update us on your thoughts as far as that potential outlook you have obviously got the ethylene plants and experience with MLPs?","Greg Garland","So, Jeff, yes, thanks. Yes, we saw that announcement and I think it probably makes sense. I think you will see more people considering that as a vehicle and a tool to use in the portfolio. I am not sure we would completely rule that out as a value creation opportunity for CPChem, but as you know, I mean we have a partner there and it would take agreement on both sides for us to proceed on something like that.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons","I understand. Secondly on condensate splitter economics, I was wondering if you could share your thoughts on how economic those splitters are at this point based on the discounts you are seeing for condensates and perhaps provide an update on your potential interest in a project there?","Greg Garland","Well, let me make a couple of general comments while Tim gathers his thoughts. And I will let him give you some of the details. I mean, we continue to be interested in condi splitters. We think there is a place for them. When you look at the asset infrastructure that we have and we are contemplating building, I think we are in a great ZIP code to create value by doing that. I think the other thing I would say around condensate splitting is \u2013 point-in-time forecast are always dangerous. So, we always try to look to see where is it going? And we think over the long-term that we can create value by doing that.","Tim Taylor","Yes, Jeff. No, I think if you look at condensate splitting and there are a number of options ones within the refinery system itself at a refinery. And as the life content goes up and the blender there, there maybe an opportunity and the need to address that, but what we are really focused on and we talked about was our initial thinking around a larger condensate splitter in the Sweeny area, where you are close to the increasing condensate production in West Texas and the Eagle Ford. And there we just look at it and say that a splitter that goes into products provides a larger margin than one that just tops that and exports or uses the top crudes so to speak in a system. So, I think we are still kind of looking at both of those options, but we like the idea of a splitter that really separates the condensate into components and you get quite a yield of naphtha and distillate cut with lesser amounts of LPG and heavier fractions off of that kind of system. So, still in evaluation, I think as Greg stated, well we are going to look at the margin opportunity in the collection system, but collectively, we see condensate production increasing and we are seeing opportunity there on both the transportation and the splitting side to be a piece of that.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons","Thanks for your comments.","Greg Garland","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yes. So, I mean, obviously you just have the Analyst Day and laid out a wealth of opportunities in the MLP space and also in the chemical space, but the refining performance I guess in the first quarter was a little weak and the slides you have released are helpful, but if I look at the slides you have laid out and you do all the regional stuff as well, there is that swing in other, but it doesn\u2019t include the sort of say the opportunity costs from maintenance. So, I am just wondering do you have like a number for the fourth quarter or what do you think the opportunity costs that you lost was for maintenance, particularly in the regions which underperformed?","Greg Garland","I think the margin loss was around $90 million is just south of a $100 million.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Right, that\u2019s helpful. And any particular split, mainly in the \u2013 I guess Alliance was down, Central Corridor as well?","Greg Garland","Yes, it\u2019s on the Gulf Coast, because I mean we have the crude tower down at Lake Charles also. And so we bought BGO to keep the refinery running. And you can question how much value created by doing that, but I think that the time that we set the plans in place, it looked like the right things to do and then we had some weakness in California.","Tim Taylor","We also had a major turnaround at Borger. So really, when you look at both the MidCon and the Gulf Coast, you had major turnarounds there and we have come back from there, but that would \u2013 those are big impacts, both on the cost side as well as the margin side.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Right. And then coming back to this condensate theme, Borger, Ponca, probably Sweeny, you are probably buying what\u2019s marketed to you as WTI? And then it turns up and it\u2019s not your old WTI that you used to buy, because obviously the components of the feedstock are getting much lighter. Can you comment a little bit about where we are you think in terms of the tipping points in terms of WTI becoming maybe even above the spec of 42 API and therefore the need to have separate infrastructure for some of this super light stuff, all we had to stress point today, do you think that that\u2019s going to occur as you look out?","Greg Garland","I don\u2019t think there is any question that people are blending condensate into TI as a way to move those volumes to market. We have not cut rates at any of our facilities. As we have strong quality control, we know what we are buying and we typically get what we want and we go directly to lease and buy and we think that\u2019s one of the strengths of our system that we have in terms of running those MidCon facilities. And we will see, I think it\u2019s probably early to say you need a separate infrastructure for condensate and condensate movement, but I think we will continue to watch that. But at this point in time, I think we are getting the right feed to the front end of our refineries and we don\u2019t see an issue with it.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yes, thanks, very helpful.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Thanks. Good morning, fellows. I appreciate you taking my questions. Maybe I could start off with the standard kind of boilerplate portfolio question, then I had a couple of data points this morning I guess with yourself saying the Whitegate process is kind of coming to an end. We also had one of your competitors saying that we have some interest on the West Coast. So, I am just kind of curious as to what was the next step there for Whitegate that you moved out to a terminal, liquidate the inventory, what\u2019s the process now and latest thoughts on the West Coast and I have got a follow up please?","Greg Garland","Okay. We said at the Analyst Day that we had limited interest from people wanting to buy the Whitegate facility. We have an obligation to run that facility via contract through mid 2016. So, I think we will continue to work options around that facility. As you know, it\u2019s the only refinery in Ireland. It produces 40% of the Irish fuel needs. I suspect that there is an answer out there for Whitegate and we will continue to work that with the Irish government. And the other thing we said around Whitegate is there was some interest in splitting Whitegate and Bantry Bay. And so we are continuing run a second step process around Bantry Bay and we will see where does that go, but I suspect we get that done this year.","And then West Coast, our focus around West Coast is running it well. I think we are good operator \u2013 we operate well. I think our assets are well positioned. So, our focus really is on improvement and getting advantage crude to the front of those refineries. And we gave you some data points today on some of the work we are doing to get advantage crudes, those firms, refineries were making progress and there is \u2013 but there is more to do. We are not through yet.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Okay. My follow up is you guys are obviously very unique in the number of levels, but particularly because you are not putting a lot of money to work in your refining business, and I guess that\u2019s still the biggest driver of your cash flow I would argue. And so when I look at your prospective buyback, your outlook to basically sustain the buybacks. I know it\u2019s a little unexact so to speak in terms of being able to predict the book. And as things stand today looking forward under the current environment, do you see a scenario where the buybacks really don\u2019t \u2013 you need to slow them down or do you think you can sustain these buybacks for an extended period given where your balance sheet is?","Greg Garland","Yes. As long as our shares trade below our intrinsic value, we are going to take shares in. And so we are buyers of the shares today.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Would you be prepared to see your balance sheet move up to the top end of your range, can you sustain that?","Greg Garland","So, I think given, if we have a 2008\/2009 I think we have said consistently we are willing to grow the balance sheet to fund our growth in our shareholder distributions. But if we are at mid-cycle type conditions, we are going to gain $4 billion or $5 billion of cash a year and we think that\u2019s sufficient to do the programs that we have laid out.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Alright, thanks. I appreciate the answers.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning guys.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Big quarter in Chemicals and I have got a macro question there, recently enterprise announced ethylene export facilities targeted to be online before your cracker comes online. So, do you have any comment on ethylene exports and whether these facilities alter your longer term ethylene surplus for you or maybe your competitive advantage versus exports on the cost curve and first mover status?","Greg Garland","So, we continue to look at ethylene exports closely. We just don\u2019t think they make sense economically. I kind of go back to the past decade in Middle East where ethane was free and no one could make it work with free ethane and now we are talking about playing between Henry Hub gas and European prices. So I mean what we will see where, does that go, you may see more ethylene exports and more interest in ethylene exports and certainly I think European petchems are interested in propane and butane for feedstocks as they are trying to do access North American energy revolution as you think about that. But let\u2019s just say you can make it work and the \u2013 you can put ethane to the facilities in Europe, they could absorb it. In our view it\u2019s between maybe 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day which is about what we think is being rejected today. So our view is it doesn\u2019t offer the balance in the U.S. in terms of ethane. Tim if you want go into deeper, it\u2019s fine.","Tim Taylor","No, I think only thing Evan is if you have ethane exports it probably does provide some support on the pricing side to bring it up. And so I think it\u2019s provides another option that we don\u2019t see that level really driving us on this supply-demand balance on the ethane side of the business to really force it, so some narrowing perhaps but still a substantial advantage in North America.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Great. And I appreciate that. My second is a few refining questions if I could, any color on the Wood River debottlenecking project announced by your partners today. And secondly, Borger utilization going forward, should we see that as higher, I know there has been heavy turnaround, but it has been heavy turnaround for \u2013 or planned, unplanned outage for last year, so I just wanted some status of how that \u2013 how we should think about that asset going forward?","Greg Garland","Yes. So I think we\u2019ve got work to do at Borger. I think that\u2019s one asset we can run better. We got a lot of focus around that internally. So I will make a couple of comments on the Wood River expansion. So as we premise the coker refinery expansion project we actually premise that on (indiscernible). And because of economic reasons we have been running on drill bit. So we have hit the condensate limits and haven\u2019t got the capacity expansion that we expected for all the right reasons. And so there is some what I would say is modest capital that can go in to remove moving those constraints that allow us to get to another 20,000 barrels a day of capacity out of that asset. We think it makes a fundamental sense. It\u2019s a good economics around that project and that\u2019s something that we want to do.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Is that 2016, 2015 or timeframe on that Wood River?","Tim Taylor","I will come back to you on that. I am not quite sure exactly\u2026","Greg Garland","It\u2019s in that range,","Tim Taylor","I don\u2019t know. Yes, let\u2019s look find out and get back to you again.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Fair enough. I appreciate you guys. Thank you.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Tim Taylor","Thanks Evan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Hi, good morning everyone.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Checking my voice for maybe this afternoon, it\u2019s been a long day so far.","Greg Garland","It\u2019s clear that way.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Yes. Just going back to some of the stuff you are talking about specifically on assets for sale, the general message I have heard from you is that you want to reduce the relative share of refining in your overall portfolio, does that mean that we should think about the whole asset base as potentially for sale. And I know you haven\u2019t been long from an analyst meeting, but did things do change fast in refining, would we consider you as a potential seller of anything that the price is right or is it going to be limited to trying to rationalize in California and Ireland and the stuff that you have been more specific about? Thanks.","Greg Garland","So I think we have been pretty specific around the assets that we are interested and going to market. Whereas the core assets we have are solid assets they generate tremendous cash flow and we can take that cash flow and that\u2019s our key to our strategy of transforming the company into a Midstream logistics chemical company with a great refining business in it. And so I wouldn\u2019t say that we would continue to go through and sell the assets. We like our position. We like the legacy infrastructure. And frankly they are in the right zip code to create value. And as we look across these value creation opportunities, Sweeny creates an opportunity for the hub, for an NGL center as you think about and an export center at Freeport. And I think we have an asset that Sweeny is an enabler for us to do that. And so as we said we are looking for value creation opportunities where we can leverage existing core infrastructure that we have.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Yes, I guess what I was driving as is the general idea that you are trying to rebalance the capital employed in the company and therefore the extent to which you would do additionally opportunistically in order to sort of get towards that rebalanced level, but you have answered the question correct. On the market, could you talk a little about the demand side of the equation I think you have referenced some of the more \u2013 some of the ethane stuff, but if you could also talk about what you are seeing for gasoline and \u2013 it looks strong and if could just give us your export numbers and the very latest on how much product you are sending out that would be great? Thank you.","Greg Garland","Yes, I think on the demand side we are encouraged by what we see on gasoline, it\u2019s been a tough winter in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast but I think as it\u2019s warmed up you\u2019ll see that but across the U.S. you kind of look at the number, you are seeing some improved demands here as the economy picks back up. And then exports continue to be an opportunity. And I think we looked at it there was opportunity from the standpoint that we will supply the markets with the best value. So we continue to see good opportunities in the export business. We were down as we said this quarter from the fourth quarter to 137,000 and that really reflected less Coastal production in the Gulf Coast for us at Alliance and it reflected the fact that we had some better opportunities in the U.S. So I think that we are going to \u2013 we are still pushing forward with our plans to get to 550,000 barrels a day of export capacity. And I think you will continue to see us over time, have an increasing proportion of our production go into the export markets and that really I think reflects we would say will be probably you have got good market crack strong operating rates in the business. So I think the industry as a whole we will continue to push exports into that market because of our cost advantages.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Yes, so when you have \u2013 it sounds like you were somewhat supply constrained and so your exports were lower but you also said there were better opportunities also within the U.S., is that typically an East Coast trade that you are undertaking from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast or is it Gulf Coast to Mid-Con or where are the outlets, where does the product go when it\u2019s got a better offer somewhere else within the U.S.?","Greg Garland","Yes I still think the East Coast is still kind of a clearing market certainly into the Midwest a bit, but the strong part is continue to be the Colonial System and the water born opportunities to the east. And on a macro level, if you think about imports and where that comes that\u2019s also makes sense that we kind of push out the imported piece of that and supply out of the U.S.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","That\u2019s great. And just finally for other non-conventional is not the right word but non-gasoline non-distillate product trade, can you talk a little bit about the extent at which you are exposed to that and I am thinking propane and everything else? Thanks.","Greg Garland","So yes, so the LPG, I will put the refineries, we have an NGL business where the actual propane is an important component for Midstream and for the refining piece. Clearly we saw first quarter movement propane prices with the winter demand, that\u2019s come off. And then as we have increased the connection of propane to export markets I think that provides another outlet as the length in propane grows with NGL production. So I think that that will continue to pull someone on that one. Coke demand or coke is the other big product, co-product so to speak and that really tradeoffs of fuel value in most instances on some of that, but then we have the upgrades the anode coke and those are still premium markets for us. So I would say that we are seeing relatively stable demand there and pricing moves in much different dynamic than it does in relation to crude.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","But the coke is not for export, right?","Greg Garland","Coke, we do supply global markets, as you look at our coke business particularly for our needle coke, which is a very high specialty coke that gets high strength for our recycle steel production and that\u2019s really Humber and Lake Charles, that\u2019s a global market. And then you do have coke markets that are really global around the world for both anodes and then the fuel markets kind of clear where it makes sense.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","And Asphalt is not a big deal for you?","Greg Garland","Asphalt is not a large piece of our operation.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Okay, great, thanks very much.","Greg Garland","Yes, and once the core project was completed that really chewed up lot of the asphalt that we have basically.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Yes, my channel check is I have seen a lot of people mending roads around these parks. Alright guys, thanks a lot.","Greg Garland","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Hi guys.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Greg earlier that you are talking about and during you Analyst Day 40% cash distribution for the cash flow, do you have any long-term target between the split on dividend and buyback?","Greg Garland","So, we haven\u2019t really \u2013 we haven\u2019t been specific on what percentage of that 40% would be dividends versus repurchases. Obviously, in the near-term, the majority has been on share repurchase. We would expect over time dividends to be a greater piece of that 40%.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","But that\u2019s no internal say target\u2026","Greg Garland","Yes, no, I would say, we definitely have some internal targets, we just \u2013 we decided to share.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","(indiscernible). Okay, that great.","Greg Garland","We cannot disclose it now.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Okay. For Bayway, is the yield going to be any meaningful different between your running Eagle Ford or running Bakken and how is that the economy maybe different?","Tim Taylor","Yes. I think we can run both clearly. I look at first that more capabilities to deliver the Bakken crude by rail and it actually fits the Bayway kit very well. So, we like that. Eagle Ford, it is on the grade, but clearly lighter probably has limits faster. And so I think we\u2019ll continue to supplement Bayway with Eagle Ford, but really Eagle Ford for us we kind of like the runs in the Gulf Coast on that crude, but increasingly we will be keep thinking about that, but I will typically run through probably more constraints on Eagle Ford before we roll on Bakken.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Just on to the LPG side, Tim, you said the LPG handling, when you run you are saying that, which is\u2026","Tim Taylor","Yes, it\u2019s the light piece. It\u2019s the relative value of the yields that you get on the two. And clearly as LLS becomes advantage in the Gulf, it creates another option for us to look at in Bayway and we have done a bit of that. And so that\u2019s really driven off the economics of shipping and relative value in the refinery, but that\u2019s been a \u2013 that could be a nice crude fit from Bayway as well.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Greg, people ask about early I think on their Chemicals side whether it is MLP for you guys, of course at that you went into some constraint with your partnership with Chevron, but there is other asset value, the wholesale some other people is also coming into the MLP. Have you look at that given you have a pretty large space of EBITDA sitting there?","Greg Maxwell","Oh, in the wholesale business?","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Yes.","Greg Maxwell","Yes. We have looked at that. So I think that\u2019s probably on most of the things we consider, but we have lot of assets that are MLP along we are working our way down the list there, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","But I mean that you will not have any resistance saying it could belong to a MLP structure if you believe \u2013 now that\u2019s better valuation?","Greg Maxwell","Yes, we believe we can put it in there.","Greg Garland","Yes. It\u2019s just a question that provides value, right.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","I see.","Greg Garland","Also if you think about there is some variation or variability in wholesale marketing earnings that we don\u2019t have in the other assets that are currently in PSXP.","Greg Maxwell","Right.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","So, we have assumed that, that even if you are going to do it will be two days to tell after you done with more of the traditional logistic output?","Greg Maxwell","I think they are probably better assets that we are looking at to drive the first.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Yes.","Greg Maxwell","We get to wholesale marketing. We got a pretty big inventory of things we can work through plus the things that we are investing in that should come on.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","I don\u2019t see it in the top or close to the top of the list, no.","Greg Maxwell","So, we haven\u2019t included that in our estimates as EBITDA either and there is other, frankly there is other things within the refining system to that we have the opportunity to think about also?","Paul Cheng - Barclays","And in the Gulf Coast, I think you are currently buying on average a feedstock 70,000 to 80,000 barrels per day and Bayway is probably about 40,000, maybe 50,000 barrels per day up to. I think that one of your peers that as a result decide that they want to expand their crude units, so that they don\u2019t need to buy the feedstock. Is that something that you guys is currently consider or that is different in your system?","Greg Garland","Well, Paul, I missed the first part of the question about what we are buying?","Paul Cheng - Barclays","I think that if we are looking at that between your crude oil intake and your total throughput, it seems to suggest that in the Gulf Coast you are buying (indiscernible) or other feedstock by about 70,000, 80,000 barrels per day in the Gulf Coast. And Bayway I believe you are probably buying about 40,000, 50,000 barrels per day. So in other words that\u2019s a real \u2013 you could expand your crude unit and so that you can eliminate their feedstock purchase, one of your peers definitely is doing it. Just want to see whether those are the investment you guys currently consider or not?","Greg Garland","So, you are correct we do buy supplemental feed to fill out the units, but we have not really advanced to a point that we say we like to make additional investment in crude distillation capacity to supplement that. So, it is an opportunities to go forward, but we would like to get little more a deep review I think on what we think that value is growing long-term.","Tim Taylor","That\u2019s something too that\u2019s tied to the condi splitter if you think about bottom end of that, I mean the bottom end is gas oil that comes off and so, you could use that also impacts the economics.","Greg Maxwell","So, Paul as you know we have been reluctant to invest in refining. I think I\u2019d point people probably challenge us to say are you under-investing in refining. But still as we look across the opportunity side of investments that we have, we like this opportunity set and we are just prioritizing in going after the high valued investments first.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Sure. And do you, clear with that, in the second quarter West Coast margin has been nominal, because a number of you peers that have downtime. In the second quarter, do you have any meaningful downtime in your refinery in the West Coast?","Greg Maxwell","We don\u2019t really provide guidance on where we are going to be down. I mean, if you just look at the turnaround expense for the second quarter guidance I think which maybe was 70.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","70.","Greg Maxwell","And so it\u2019s about half of what it was in the first quarter. We typically take our big turnarounds in the first and the fourth quarters.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","A final one, any rough estimate what is the total factory crude storage capacity?","Greg Maxwell","What about it, Tim?","Tim Taylor","Pipeline fills and lots of storage tanks, so I think that you are going to continue to see that, but I have not done the exact math on that, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Tim, you don\u2019t have anything on the fingertip? Alright, thank you.","Tim Taylor","That we suspect it\u2019s filling, we\u2019re not profitable.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Alright, thank you very much.","Tim Taylor","Thanks Paul. Take care.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Very good morning.","Greg Garland","Hey Roger.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","I guess maybe sort of keeping on with the theme here on the light sweet side maybe not specific numbers of barrels of storage, but what do you or what are you running today versus what do you think your capacity is across your system for the light barrel. So even if you include California where maybe you can\u2019t quite get the barrels there today, how do you look at the future opportunity of price advantaged barrels?","Greg Garland","Sure. Light sweet for us is we've got on the global side light medium 65% of our input and really if I look around the system we are light where it makes sense today, you look at the burning we could do to increase that and probably the place where I like to think about it though is Bayway where can we continue to push out additional imported light at that system. In Gulf Coast it's really now mostly domestic light for us and so that's a question of which grades and do we start to work on the kit to increase that, but we\u2019ve still have a lot of innate capability I think that to fuel more into Bayway and that\u2019s been our first thinking about how do we increase the access to that, continue to push those into the West Coast particularly into Ferndale as well.","And then California for us is really a heavy type of market and do we\u2019re increasing connectivity there but I think we have got capability to keep ramping that up but it\u2019s something that we really haven\u2019t seen that says we have got a constraint in what we want to run to make them right values in our refining system. So, that\u2019s really what drives us is heavy and heavy probably makes the most sense, I think you got the dynamics between light, medium and right now I think that we have had a lot of optionality on the light side and we are just going to optimize around that.","Tim Taylor","Yes, we have said somewhere that there may be 100,000 to 150,000 barrels a day of incremental domestic light sweet crude capacity that we are trying to get to, but still that hasn\u2019t been filled.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then light against medium would be an additional number of barrels beyond that number?","Greg Garland","That\u2019s right. I would just assume that we will continue to run medium based on what we see in the structure, should that change that could push on that.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then I was a little late on to the call, the Midstream business had a great quarter if you addressed why that was and what the sustainability of that performance was and what the sustainability of that performance was, I apologize, but if not, could you kind of walk us through what helped that performance out this quarter?","Greg Garland","So I think that it\u2019s in several different buckets, obviously strong NGL prices $1.06, volumes were up at DCP by 10% I think as you think about that all of it is driven by equity gains at DCP. They did $1.1 billion of acquisition, the DPM level which created equity gains that pull backup. So that was the big piece of that. Then our transportation business had a better quarter, essentially volumes were about equalizing but certainly rising revenues as we continued to work the fee structure.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay. But in terms of thinking of this, it\u2019s a high point at least in the near-term. we should see something more like the back half of 2013 in terms of a sustainable kind of performance from Midstream?","Greg Garland","Yes, I think we expected NGL prices to come off some. They are driven by seasonal propane demand for the most part. But yes, I would think of return to something more normal.","Greg Maxwell","And Roger you won\u2019t expect the unit gains to continue, that was something that grew to $23 million, we are selling, again as Greg said they are associated with the big drop.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Right, okay and then I guess final question just on the rail capacity side, so you have got 1,200 cars we have obviously had the announcement of some changes in what\u2019s required in terms of railcar design, but it\u2019s not necessary given what that\u2019s going to be. Can you give us an idea where you stand not just on the crude moving side but also on products if we have an issue with cars when your overall fleet would be compliant with the DOT 111A kind of design is that\u2019s what is ultimately going be the car that gets used everywhere?","Greg Garland","So the new crude cars do meet that standard. So that increment and then within our existing fleet depending on where it would go they are moved to some other services if something came there could be some need to change or modify those cars which are relatively small percentage on that on the product side. We got lot of cars that are in service in terms of bulk movements of solids as well as paint cars. So it\u2019s really the crude cars we feel very good about the ones we have purchased. And then we would have some amount of our fleet relatively small amount that if there was a change that would not meet that current spec, but they\u2019re not\u2026","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay, thanks. I am sorry and then your joint venture partners what are their crude tank cars look, do you have a feel for whether those are compliant at this point or will be?","Greg Garland","Yes, it\u2019s a mix and that\u2019s certainly an area that we are working with them to make \u2013 we want those in the compliant cars and certainly we will be compliant. And we want them to meet the newest spec. And so we are continuing to work with that making good progress.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Those are more around third party\u2026","Greg Garland","That\u2019s a third party versus a joint venture.","Greg Maxwell","Corporate cars.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay, yeah.","Greg Garland","I thought we talked about CPK.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","No, actually I am sorry I mean where you are using or you talked about earlier the agreements with \u2013 at Hardesty and then in Casper where it sounds like it\u2019s a third party or a joint venture I wasn\u2019t sure which there is the global which I believe that is a joint venture to bring at the Bayway or?","Greg Garland","That\u2019s a contractual relationship on unloading capacity and loading. And so that\u2019s \u2013 those were all I think collectively as industry looking to how do we get to that and that\u2019s part of what we are doing is working on our supply chain is to make sure that we are bringing those that crude cars up to that spec, that\u2019s what we want. And so we are working through that, but we are in pretty good shape on that.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay. So we don\u2019t, I guess well I just trying to get as well and now we have to be concerned that your car fleet is fine but their is not and that could have impact on crude coming into those units?","Greg Garland","And its not \u2013 at this point we haven\u2019t determined that\u2019s a really large impact for us. We feel pretty good about that.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay, great. Thank you.","Greg Garland","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Faisal Khan of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Faisal Khan - Citigroup","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Faisal Khan - Citigroup","Just a few questions on the \u2013 in the quarter you guys discussed how in the Transportation segment you saw some of the increases in margins from sort of railcar rates. As you sort of ramp up the ownership of more railcars, can you discuss a little bit what the sort of transport pricing and what the rate and volume sort of rate sort of mechanism is to understand how those margins and revenue sort of grow over time?","Greg Garland","So, those rail rates we basically just take those to our market rate and so that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing as we talked about within the company before we form the MLP and the Transportation is separate business unit, those were really cost centers. So this is all part of the process to get to market base rates. Frankly, the rail component of that is a relatively small amount of the transportation revenue. So we\u2019ll continue to run those to market rates and that\u2019s really that stream but it shouldn\u2019t be its not going to be a larger driver or big increase in the transportation income.","Faisal Khan - Citigroup","Okay. Does that also include the loading terminals, unloading terminals as well?","Greg Garland","Loading terminals and unloading will be done at a market based rate as well. So as the new rail terminals at Bayway and Ferndale come in those are operated agreements with the refinery where we charge a market rate for those services. And that was part of what we included in our qualifying income that we talked about at the Analyst Day.","Faisal Khan - Citigroup","Okay, just wanted to make sure, thanks. And just to clarify on the Sweeny Hub for the propane exports that sort of 150,000 a day in the initial stage you guys talked about building. Is 100% of that spoken for by UNIPEC or is there some, I think you guys discussed this a little bit but I don\u2019t remember?","Greg Garland","Yes.","Faisal Khan - Citigroup","Was that 100% that booked on support by UNIPEC or was there some open capacity?","Greg Garland","No, there is some open capacity, we\u2019ll likely to use some of that within PSX and then we still have the opportunity to look for additional third party but we were very pleased to get a key tenant so to speak or key contract with UNIPEC to underpin that.","Faisal Khan - Citigroup","Okay, got it. And then the guidance you gave the $400 million to $500 million of EBITDA that only includes the revenues from UNIPEC, it doesn\u2019t include any sort of marketing component or open some sort of spread between propane prices here in the U.S. and somewhere else, does it?","Greg Maxwell","So, that $400 million to $500 million is largely fee based. I think we indicated it\u2019s probably in the range of $300 million to $350 million that would be fee based that\u2019s kind of based on the capacities of the frac and the export terminal.","Faisal Khan - Citigroup","Right.","Greg Maxwell","So that would leave some amount in that says that would be commodity exposure (indiscernible) opportunity that we see as a key piece of the project to add value for PSX. So it\u2019s a mixture that\u2019s predominantly fee based.","Faisal Khan - Citigroup","Okay guys. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s helpful. And just on the Marketing segment you guys have been putting in the export volumes and therefore for quite some time as I make sure understand in that business when you discussed the exported volumes. So for example in the first quarter, export numbers were down versus the fourth quarter, how do we look at sort of the margin impact from that sort of volume sort of downtick \u2013 from fourth quarter to first quarter in Marketing?","Greg Garland","So I mean, looked at the numbers across \u2013 the last four quarters or so, we\u2019re generally $1 to $2 a barrel better in our next best alternative domestically.","Faisal Khan - Citigroup","And so that\u2019s how it gets sort of captured in the marketing business through that sort of growth?","Greg Garland","Correct.","Faisal Khan - Citigroup","Okay, understood. Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the time.","Greg Garland","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Clayton Reasor.","Clayton Reasor - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Affairs","Great. Well, I really appreciate all the questions and interest in the company. We are off to a great start in 2014 and if you got any additional questions, feel free to give me or Greg a call.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Clayton Reasor, SVP of Investor Relations, Strategies and Corporate Affairs. You may begin.","C. Clayton Reasor","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Phillips 66 second quarter earnings conference call. With me this morning are Chairman and CEO, Greg Garland; CFO, Greg Maxwell; and EVP, Tim Taylor. The presentation material we'll be using this morning can be found on our Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information.","Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It's a reminder that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here on slide 2 and on our filings with the SEC. Also the registration statement relating to the securities of Phillips 66 Partners LP was recently declared effective by the SEC, because we remain in a sensitive period regarding disclosures around this offering, our remarks about the MLP will be limited and we will not take questions on the offering during today\u2019s call.","That said, I'll turn the call over to Greg Garland for some opening remarks.","Greg C. Garland","Thanks, Clayton. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We faced some challenges in the second quarter, both operationally and with overall market conditions, crude differentials narrowed and although overall crack spreads improved second quarter versus the first quarter, our realized margins were significantly lower. We had unplanned downtime at some of our chemicals and refining facilities which reduced utilization rate and because of the extended downtime in chemicals, we really missed an opportunity to demonstrate the earnings resilience of our portfolio.","We should have run better and our earnings results reflect this. Despite these challenges, we continue to generate strong cash flows; cash from operations was $1 billion for the quarter, just over $3 billion year-to-date. During the quarter, we returned more than $700 million of capital to our shareholders and continued on our stated plan to strengthen our balance sheet, paying down $500 million of debt. In addition, we plan to complete the current $2 billion share repurchase program this year and our Board has authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program that we plan to initiate before the end of 2013.","Our strategy to enhance refining returns through increasing use of advantaged crudes while growing our higher value businesses remains unchanged. On July 15, we launched our Master Limited Partnership, Phillips 66 Partners. This MLP will own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based transportation and midstream assets. The MLP will be a tool to grow the midstream business of Phillips 66 and weave a web of infrastructure between our operating businesses.","We continue to deliver on our plans. By the end of the second quarter, we\u2019ve taken delivery of 650 railcars of the 2,000 that we\u2019ve ordered. These cars will be used to transport advantaged crude to Phillips 66 refineries on the East and West Coast. Our chemicals joint venture CPChem completed the NGL fractionator expansion project during the second quarter at the Sweeny facility. The project increased capacity by nearly 20%.","Also during the quarter, we commissioned a high-capacity truck facility at Ponca City Refinery, which gives us additional access to Mississippian Lime crude. We continue to increase our refined product exports. In the second quarter, we set a new quarterly record of 181,000 barrels a day.","Finally, as part of our ongoing portfolio optimization efforts, Phillips 66 sold its proprietary E-Gas Technology. And earlier this month, we also closed on the sale of the Immingham Combined Heat and Power Plant in the United Kingdom.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg Maxwell, who will take you through the quarterly numbers.","Greg G. Maxwell","","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, reported earnings were $958 million or $1.53 per share. If we look at on adjusted basis, earnings were $935 million or $1.50 per share. Excluding changes in working capital, cash from operations for the quarter was $1.2 billion. Our cash flow generation enabled us to fund our capital expenditures, pay over $190 million in dividends and repurchase nearly $550 million or 8.6 million shares of our common stock during the quarter.","From the inception of the share repurchase program in 2012 through the end of the second quarter, we\u2019ve repurchased 22.6 million shares. On an adjusted basis, our annualized year-to-date return on capital employed was 17%.","Slide 5 provides a comparison of our second quarter adjusted earnings with that of the second quarter a year ago on a segment basis. As you can see, adjusted earnings decreased by $482 million to $935 million with lower realized refining margins accounting for the bulk of this variance. I\u2019ll cover each of these segments in more detail later in the webcast.","Moving next to our second quarter cash flow, during the quarter we generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations, excluding the impacts of working capital changes and as you can see on the slide, changes in working capital were a negative impact of $206 million.","We returned $738 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and this represented 76% of our cash from operations and during the quarter we repaid an additional $500 million of our three-year term loan.","And finally, we funded about $370 million of our capital expenditures in investments and this is primarily in the Refining and Midstream segments and we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4.2 billion.","As for our capital structure on Slide 7, at quarter end we had equity of $21.7 billion and debt of $6.5 billion. This resulted in a debt-to-capital ratio of 23%, which is shown in the shaded area, is at the lower end of our targeted range of 20% to 30%.","Taking into account our $4.2 billion ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 9%. As a reminder, we plan on further reducing our debt balance to $6 billion by the end of the year.","Next, we\u2019ll cover each of our segments in more details, starting with Midstream on Slide 8. The Midstream segment includes three business lines. It includes Transportation, it includes our equity investment in DCP Midstream, and it also includes NGL Operations and Other.","Overall, the Midstream segment was down this quarter versus last year with benefits from Transportation more than offset by declines from DCP Midstream and our NGL Operations. The annualized year-to-date adjusted ROCE for Midstream was 11% and this is based on an average capital employed of $3.1 billion.","Slide 9 shows Midstream\u2019s adjusted earnings of $90 million, which is a decrease of $5 million from the prior year. Transportation was up $26 million and this is mainly due to improved throughput fees driven by implementation of new market-based rates across many of our logistics assets as well as higher volumes, which include increases from refinery utilization.","Adjusted earnings from DCP Midstream decreased by $12 million this quarter, this was primarily due to impacts of asset dropdowns to DCP Midstream partners, offset somewhat by improved natural gas prices as well as lower operating costs compared to last year. Earnings for NGL operations and other were down $19 million and this is related mostly to gains associated with inventory draws during the second quarter of 2012.","On the next slide, we\u2019ll move on to a discussion of our Chemicals segment. Our Chemicals segment results were largely impacted by planned and unplanned downtime primarily at the Sweeny and Port Arthur facilities, resulting in a global olefins and polyolefins capacity utilization of 78%. While earnings for the Specialties, Aromatics & Styrenics segment were flat for the quarter, we did see an increase in earnings from CPChem\u2019s joint ventures in this segment. The annualized year-to-date return on capital employed from our Chemicals segment was 25% and this is based on an average capital employed of $3.6 billion.","As shown on slide 11 second quarter earnings decreased by $61 million compared to the same period last year. The decrease in earnings was primarily in olefins and polyolefins driven by unplanned power outages at CPChem\u2019s Sweeny Complex as well as an extended 91 day turnaround at its Port Arthur facility.","In May of this year, CPChem was required to declare force majeure on ethylene and certain derivatives, following these outages.","The outages at the Sweeny facility during both the first quarter and the second quarter of 2013 resulted in loss production of approximately 540 million pounds. These outages as well as the downtime at Port Arthur resulted in higher manufacturing costs and decreased production sales volumes for ethylene, polyethylene, and normal alpha olefins in the second quarter of 2013. While industry ethylene margins remained strong, CPChem realized lower margins because of these unplanned events.","Specialties, Aromatics & Styrenics earnings were flat compared with last year as higher equity affiliate earnings were offset by lower volumes and higher cost. The improvement of $27 million shown in corporate and other is primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter, largely as a result of the mix in foreign and domestic taxable income.","As we move next to refining, our realized margin was $9.88 per barrel with a global crude utilization rate of 94% and a clean product yield of 85%. Our utilization rate this quarter was reduced 5 percentage points as a result of unplanned downtime at several refineries including the Sweeny and Wood River refineries.","This unplanned downtime equates to the absence of our 116,000 barrels per day of crude throughput in a quarter where our weighted average realized refining margins was almost $10 per barrel. In addition, downtime an in our chemical segment yielded a similar negative economic impact. We increased our advantage crude slate in the U.S. from 58% in the second quarter of last year to 68% in 2013, and this is mainly due to processing more shale, more WTI, and more heavy Canadian crudes.","The annualized year-to-date adjusted return on capital employed in the refining segment was 19% with an average capital employed for the segment of $14.3 billion.","Slide 13, provides more detail on earnings in our refining segment. Adjusted earnings for refining were $481 million this quarter. This is down $404 million from a year ago primarily due to lower margins particularly in the Central Corridor and the Gulf Coast regions.","Starting on the left, the decrease of $77 million in the Atlantic Basin\/Europe region primarily reflects decreased margins as well as the negative impact from the scheduled turnaround at our Humber Refinery in the second quarter of 2013. Results from our Gulf Coast operations decreased nearly $250 million compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. And this is mainly due to lower gasoline and distillate differentials as the second quarter 2013 had larger discounts on distillate products as well as lower premiums for gasoline.","Market capture in the Gulf Coast was 39% this quarter compared to 74% for the second quarter of 2012. The Central Corridor results largely reflect weakening Canadian crude deferentials as well as lower market cracks.","The WTI\/WCS differential was $16.71 during the second quarter of 2013 compared with $19.80 in 2012. This contributed to a market capture of 71% in the second quarter of 2013 compared with 94% last year.","Western Pacific\u2019s improvement of $67 million over last year is largely due to fewer turnarounds and less downtime in the second quarter of 2013.","And then finally our other refining was up this quarter compared to last year, primarily as a result of favorable foreign exchange impacts. Our refining segment continued to incur increased cost per RINs in the second quarter to the extent that these costs were not included in the cracks in the selling price of motor fuels then such costs negatively impact our realized refining margins.","Let\u2019s now take a look at our market capture shown on slide 14. When we compare the weighted average market 3-2-1 margin against the actual margin that we captured, you can see that we were negatively impacted by the value of secondary products and our overall configuration.","Market capture for the quarter was 56%. This is down from 72% in the second quarter of 2012. Our realized margin for the second quarter of 2013 was $9.88 per barrel and this compares with $12.85 per barrel last year. This $2.69 per barrel configuration adjustment reflects the fact that our clean product yield of 85% is less than 100% assumed in the market crack.","And the $5.41 per barrel reduction related to secondary products is primarily driven by coke and NGLs and reflects the fact that these products attracted a sales price that on average was lower than the cost of our benchmark crudes.","The positive $2 per barrel adjustment for feedstock stems from running certain crudes and other feedstocks that are priced lower than our benchmark crudes. For example, our feedstock advantage this quarter was primarily related to running Canadian heavy crude. And finally, the other category reflects the impact of various product differentials and higher RIN costs.","Slide 15 shows the comparison of advantaged crude runs at our refineries as well as clean product yields for 2011, 2012 and year-to-date 2013.","In the U.S. advantaged crudes increased from 62% in 2012 to 68% in 2013. The decrease another heavy crude from 27% last year to 23% year-to-date this year was largely due to turnaround activity and power outages at our Sweeny refinery this year.","As shown on the graph on the right, we continue to focus on improving our clean product yields, achieving an overall 84% yield across our refining system this year.","This next slide covers our marketing and specialty segment or M&S. Worldwide marketing margins were $0.052 per gallon in the second quarter and while our refining segment experienced higher RIN cost in the second quarter, M&S benefitted from higher RIN values created by its renewable fuel blending activities.","In Specialties, compared to last year, our flow improved and sales volume increased by 17% and our lubricant volumes were up by 7%. And the annualized year-to-date adjusted return for the M&S segment was 29% on average capital employed of $3.6 billion.","Slide 17 provides some additional detail about the marketing specialties segment. Actual reported earnings for M&S in the second quarter of 2013 were $332 million. If we exclude the gain from the sale of the E-Gas Technology and related licenses, adjusted earnings were $309 million and this is the $25 million increase from the same quarter last year.","Marketing and others adjusted earnings increased $22 million, largely driven by higher volumes on renewable fuel blending and decreased costs, partially offset by lower inventory impacts.","Specialties adjusted earnings improved slightly over last year\u2019s second quarter as improved volumes more than offset lower margins.","Moving next to Corporate and Other, this segment includes net interest expense, corporate overhead costs, technology and other costs that are not directly associated with our operating segments. Corporate and Other adjusted cost for the second quarter of 2013 were $126 million after-tax compared with $95 million for the first quarter this year. This increase of $31 million was largely due to taxes and higher environmental expenses, both of which are included in the Other category.","This concludes my discussion of the financial and operational results for the quarter. I\u2019ll next cover a few outlook items.","In Chemicals, for the third quarter, we expect a global O&P utilization rate to return to the low 90s. For Refining, for the third quarter, we expect our global utilization rate to be in the mid-90 range. With regard to turnarounds, our pre-tax turnaround expense is expected to be approximately $60 million to $70 million in the third quarter and in Corporate and Other we continue to expect our after-tax cost to be in the $105 million to $110 million range and the total effective tax rate for the Company is expected to be in the low 30s.","And then, finally, regarding capital expenditures for the year, we are on track to be in the $1.9 billion range as we previously have guided.","With that, now we\u2019ll open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks. Hi, guys. Maybe I\u2019ll take my full quota of two if I may. Greg, can I ask you about RINs? It seems that you get a fairly big impact both on Refining and then the Marketing segment this quarter. What I\u2019m trying to understand is that RINs have obviously spiked higher. I guess it pulled back a little bit here, but in terms of the moving parts as when you acquired your RINs sort of signing perhaps at lower prices versus selling RINs in retail at higher prices, how should we think about the net impact of RINs be at this kind of level as we move into let\u2019s say 2014 because obviously it\u2019s a big deal for Valero. Trying to understand what the scale could be for you guys. And I\u2019ve got a follow-up please.","Greg C. Garland","","I\u2019ll take a stab and then Tim can kind of fill in. And so, you got to let me get on the sub-box for a minute and with the standard that this is an unworkable program in our view in terms of RINs and where RINs is going, but with some hope that ultimately this is going to get fixed on a political level in Washington. So I would say there\u2019s a broader understanding about the potential impact of what RINs causes for American consumers and for refiners.","We look at RINs, we do trade RINs and we have a very sophisticated commercial organization that does that to optimize the value for P66. So we don\u2019t necessarily want to go into what our positions are on RINs because we really think it disadvantages our commercial people in terms of that. We continue to believe we have a very sophisticated system and complex system. We have multiple levers that we use whether it\u2019s export, producing non-RIN bearing product, blending more as we look to manage that overall value increment for PSX. So, sophisticated commercial capabilities of large system, and this is just one of the costs that we manage everyday.","Timothy G. Taylor","Just to reiterate that, I think it is something that we look at in terms of optimization of our systems, we have to certainly factor that in, and I think that wait and see what the future holds in terms of those values, but there is a lot of moving parts to address RFS, at the larger level, and I think that just will continue till the resolution reaches, but to reiterate what Greg said, we look at this and just say, it doesn\u2019t work post 2014 and that needs to be addressed.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tim, are you prepared to say whether you\u2019re net longer now across the organization.","Timothy G. Taylor","No, we haven\u2019t and again, actually the commercial activities they\u2019d managed the RINs program and do a great job of that, and it has it, we don\u2019t view that as a large determinant of our results.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. My follow-up is really more of a logistics question, I guess in terms of moving crude around obviously we\u2019ve seen a lot of changes since the last call on the differentials. I am just curious as you\u2019d step up your shale, share of your feedstocks, how important is yield improvement relative to the differential in terms of how sticky your commitment would be to maintaining that very high level of shale production and maybe any color on how it\u2019s changing your transportation thoughts in moving advantaged crude to the different plants. I\u2019ll leave it that. Thanks.","Timothy G. Taylor","I think clearly the second quarter saw substantial narrowing on the light crude and several factors drove that so my comment is we have a very large multi-point logistics system, refining system, and we take in account those current markets signals and we\u2019re adjusting our crude slate.","The value of the shale crude in terms of its yield, its absolute price relative to other alternatives where you think about, so going forward, we still believe that those fundamentals are there on the supply piece as they continue to increase, so we like what we\u2019ve done on logistics piece of our system, we are going to continue to increase our options on that.","However, we are mindful of the current market and we adjust our crude slates accordingly and we are making some of those adjustments now to really maximize the value of our system, we take into account all the factors, yield price, et cetera, but fundamentally, we still see that inland crudes from Canada and North America will be advantaged and we are going to continue to find ways to increase our ability to run those.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I will leave it there. Thanks.","C. Clayton Reasor","Thanks Tom.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Manav Gupta \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi this is Manav Gupta for Evan today. Given your unique and leading position as a North American interior gatherer, a global chemical operator and now the new MLP, do you see additional growth projects or NGL exports out of the Gulf Coast, and in propane and butane and in the heavier NGL barrels, there is a clear arbitrage that global prices are much higher, so exporting NGLs will ultimately support your POP prices and the infrastructure might even be MLP-able so anything on those lines?","Greg C. Garland","Well I think we have a stated position. We want to grow our midstream business. I think when you look at the breadth of our portfolio, spanning refining, petrochemicals, NGLs et cetera, we sat in a unique position, and I\u2019ll talk about weaving this web of infrastructure, so we see both sides of this and I think we sat in a unique spot to make these investments and so we have talked about it, and 100,000 barrel a day crack at our Sweeney facility all the associated infrastructure where there is pipelines, storage, and export facility at Freeport. So it is a multi-billion dollar investment as we think about this, we are advancing the engineering on this project. But we see a clear opportunity and one that we think that Phillips 66 can execute on.","Manav Gupta \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","And just a follow-up on the crude by rail, I mean you took deliveries of 650 cars in this quarter and stuff, so the [inaudible] between the Bakken and what's coming on the East Coast through the African crudes has close a little. So is your system flexible, so you can move crude not only to the East Coast, but divert those cars to the West Coast and not any other place you would want or its more rigid there you have long-term contracts?","Timothy G. Taylor","","Specifically on the flexibility for rail that's why we like rail. It is a flexible system. So we have a lot of optionality in that and we have reduced our take on the Bakken to the East Coast as we have adjusted our crude slates and replacing that with more competitive barrels from imports.","Manav Gupta \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Thank you so much guys. Thanks again.","C. Clayton Reasor","","I'd appreciate it.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Yeah, congratulations on PSXP. Just wanted to, just follow-up on the prior question, when do you think you could actually sanction this multibillion project, and what sort of I guess returns or EBITDA time multiples do you think such a project would, what is the correct way for us to think about it.","Timothy G. Taylor ","","So, I think in terms of timing Ed that I think that the fractionator is advancing and we think about that as startup in 2015, so we're trying to bring that into a decision point from an FID in the early part of next year.","It takes a little longer on the export terminal and so we\u2019re working that piece and I look at the returns on these projects as, what I\u2019d call, typical midstream returns to be competitive in MLP space. So to be accretive to MLPs and you look at transactions in the marketplace 10 to 12 multiples and EBITDA are kinds of things that kind of have to be met from a cost of capital standpoint. So clearly large investment opportunity, but we think these are very competitive from the midstream standpoint.","Greg C. Garland","","Ed I\u2019ll add Tim answered that question because whatever data he gave you wasn\u2019t going to be soon enough.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Right. So you said a bit longer on the export facility of Freeport in terms of startup beyond 2015, is that\u2026?","Timothy G. Taylor","Yeah, beyond startup. I think that takes longer with permitting an additional work that has to be done down there.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Right, okay. And then, just you mentioned in the opening remarks that product premiums were below and above benchmarks over time and obviously that affects the capture rates. I mean, is there any sort of dollar million number you could put around that in refining as we think about that just to help on the modeling side, maybe versus Q1 or year-over-year?","Timothy G. Taylor","","I\u2019m not sure \u2013 I can come back to you on that one Ed. I think you are talking about tens of millions of dollars sequentially between the \u2013 on the Gulf Coast between the first and the second quarter, but we can circle back around.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Okay. And then final question on your Louisiana refineries, obviously you\u2019ve seen competitive results, which also suffered from RINs, but the refinery is EBIT positive because probably they are situated over in Texas and obviously you had some downtime as well, but maybe talk a little bit about how you can improve the profitability of the sort of Louisiana refineries, say, as more crude production comes out of Texas.","Timothy G. Taylor","","Ed, it really is around getting the crude slate more competitive and so we have in Louisiana quite a bit of wide exposure LLS based crudes. So the Eagle Ford connection that we\u2019ve started moving more barrels there and the charters that we took on the marine vessels are key piece of that. So we are increasing our utilization of really much of the Texas based crudes into that system and I think that\u2019s really the shorter term opportunity. ","Our view would be Ho-Ho will help alleviate the situation in Louisiana as well when it comes out at the end of the year. But despite that I think there is additional logistics capacity needed to really bring additional pressure on the LLS. But our view continues to be that as these light oils make it to the Gulf Coast and they come into Texas that that\u2019s going to continue to pressure.","So we are spending a lot time thinking about how do we get additional amounts of those crudes into the Louisiana system. So that really is the focal point for Louisiana.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks very much.","","Greg C. Garland","","Thanks Ed.","","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bradley Olsen from Tudor Pickering. Please go ahead.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.","","Hey, good morning everyone.","Greg C. Garland","","Hi, good morning.","","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.","I wanted to follow-up on Ed\u2019s question about Louisiana refining operations given the kind of persistent stubborn strength we\u2019ve seen in LLS over the last several months, are you finding that you\u2019re still processing I guess more than you would like of LLS crude and I guess put in other way between your tanking operations as well as the opportunity to potentially take crude by rail down there in St. James, do you have the opportunity to potentially displace all of the LLS imports which at least according to EIA data are now at a relatively low level.","Greg C. Garland","You meant light oil importantly, essentially in our system we have essentially pushed that out. Frankly, I think that my comment would be as, we\u2019ll make the economic, optimum decision, if we need to bring in waterborne cargos to optimize that, then we will. But yeah, I look at this and there is no reason as you look at the balances to believe that the next six to 12 months that you shouldn\u2019t be able to really push a lot of the on the Gulf Coast in general, those light imports out of system and we think ultimately that\u2019s what brings the pressure on the local production of the LLS type of crudes.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.","And I guess, in another way I\u2019m asking that, the LLS benchmark, you don\u2019t believe is going to see significant pressure from just rail volumes and the barge and tanker volumes alone, do you think that over the next kind of 12 months, we are going to need to actually see that pipeline come online from Texas to Louisiana to really bring an end to that LLS premium that we have seen recently?","Timothy G. Taylor","","That\u2019s the short-term largest volume impact that we see on the supply side of that and clearly there is a lot of incentive for Bakken provinces to go to the Gulf Coast today, so that has an impact as well. I will say that I think that general shortage of light oil in the second quarter probably cropped up that LLS because there was actually pull on that to the midwest as well.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.","Right, okay, great. And you mentioned in your press release that RIN or rather product sales differentials reduced sequential quarter-over-quarter results in refining by about $200 million. I realize that you don\u2019t want to give specifics around RIN exposure, but is it fair to say that those product sales differentials are largely composed of RIN-related costs?","Timothy G. Taylor","","No, I don\u2019t think so. Greg, I don\u2019t know if you know what the specific numbers are. But what we\u2019re talking about there is the premium that we had been receiving for gasoline on the Gulf Coast shrunk in the second quarter versus the first, and the discount that we were receiving for our distillate sales on the Gulf Coast actually widened. And I don\u2019t think that that was related or tied to RIN values increasing. I think that just was market forces on the Gulf Coast and the value of \u2013 I guess the value of the products that we\u2019re selling, declining relative to the U.S. Gulf Coast markers. So, I really wouldn\u2019t tie it to RIN values.","Greg C. Garland","","Right.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.","And generally speaking, when talking about RINs, they flow through Refining reporting through the other line alongside the differentials. Is that the right way to think about it?","Greg C. Garland","Yes.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.","Okay. Great. And just \u2013 you know, just I don\u2019t want to belabor this point, but on the Gulf Coast segment, you did mention LLS specifically, but didn\u2019t mention Maya or heavier grade crudes as much. Was the mix in the Gulf Coast really just an LLS driven phenomenon? Or did you feel some of the impact of tight heavy light spreads in the second quarter? And going forward in the latter half of this year, do you feel as though maybe some of the pressure that you felt in the Gulf Coast around LLS will ease as we\u2019ve seen heavy spreads widen out in the last month or two?","Greg C. Garland","I would say the answer to that, yes. I mean, clearly the pull down in the light-heavy differential, [we\u2019re] running about 40% heavy on the Gulf Coast. So that\u2019s a piece of it and Maya was a large part of that. I think the other thing too is around \u2013 we make about 40% distillate and so we saw distillate crack go down and, well, the gasoline crack went up. So, I think there is a component of that in the miss also. But clearly we underperformed in the Gulf Coast.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.","","Great. That\u2019s all for me. Thanks a lot, guys.","Greg C. Garland","","Thanks.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","","Good morning.","Greg C. Garland","","Good morning.","","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","I was curious on the RINs activity is, just for clarification, is the 100% of the RINs requirement for purchases going on in the Refining segment and 100% of the blending in RINs generating activity going on in the Marketing and Specialty segment or is it a little bit more of a mix?","Greg G. Maxwell","","Jeff, this is Greg Maxwell. I think you have it right. Basically, all of the RINs that are generated through our blending activities show up as a benefit in Marketing and Specialties, and then, the cost of those RINs or the value, if you will, are transferred over to Refining. So the Refining segment reflects the full impact of the RIN costs during the quarter.","","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","","Okay. And have you seen the high price of RINs impact the supply of gasoline more broadly in the U.S? Have you seen evidence of RINs discouraging fuel imports or encouraging fuel exports? Have RIN prices gotten high enough to discourage gasoline production. Are you seeing that evidenced in your portfolio or in the industry more broadly?","Greg G. Maxwell","","Yeah, I think on the industry perspective, I think utilization is still pushed to run given the spreads that we\u2019ve seen. So I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s really affected the industry, the run. So still a lot of incentive. It has affected the mix. Imports clearly become more dear as you get a (inaudible) value on that, and you\u2019re kind of seeing some shifting around a little bit in terms of, say, where European producers would sell where they maybe have gone to Northeast in the past, they may go to West Africa or some other markets. And then you\u2019re seeing some of the production filling in that gap on the import side, but it also still creates an opportunity on the export side, the Gulf Coast as well.","So, the value of a RIN does impact the optimization about which markets and where you choose to sell, and I think you\u2019re seeing that across the system, but with the market cracks where they are, it\u2019s still encouraging high run rates.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Got it. Final from me, I was wondering if you could provide the opportunity loss in the EBITDA for the Sweeny and Port Arthur outages for refining and for chemicals?","Greg C. Garland","","(inaudible).","Greg G. Maxwell","","Yeah, we\u2019ve got that here. Hold on a second. You\u2019re looking for the loss opportunity or what the cost is\u2026?","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","","Correct.","Greg G. Maxwell","","For those being down, got that Greg?","Greg C. Garland","","Yeah, I\u2019m getting that for you.","Greg G. Maxwell","","Maybe I\u2019ll address the chemicals piece. On the, most of the change in the operating income for the quarter-on-quarter was the majority of that change was due to the loss opportunity that we have in the power outages at Sweeny. Secondarily, the impact of the Port Arthur extended turnaround was the other piece of that. So the margin environment was still quite strong, certainly was about the volume impact.","Timothy G. Taylor","Yeah, Jeff, if you look at the profit opportunities as we calculated in the second quarter, it\u2019s about $175 million.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","","That $175 million is total for both Sweeny and Port Arthur including chemicals and refining all aggregated?","Greg G. Maxwell","","That is correct, and it\u2019s our obviously our equity impact from CPChem and it also includes a small portion of Midstream, but it wasn\u2019t really material.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","","Thanks for your comments.","Greg G. Maxwell","","You bet.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning everyone.","Greg C. Garland","","Good morning Paul.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I got a couple of kind of deep in the weeds question about activities to changes that you\u2019ve put on kind of reading that slide 22, but I rather than go straight into this greater high level question for you, the CO. Was there a patent issues would be under performance that you\u2019ve identified in the quarters, is there concern here regarding your relatively low CapEx levels, and what you said was a tough quarter for you guys.","Greg G. Maxwell","No, I mean we just look at the fundamentals, Paul and we think that the advantage crude pieces remains in tact, and we do expect spreads to open back up later this year. It doesn\u2019t change our investment profile in terms of putting advantage crude to the front end of the refineries through infrastructure or increasing our ability to export because long-term we think that\u2019s value creative, doesn\u2019t change our view on our Midstream events or our chemicals investments and shifting more investment into these higher value business.","So I would say our view the strategy it remains in tact from that standpoint. The other thing I would say is, the teams with under performance, the prior hedges, so we had a extended turnaround, major turnaround at Sweeny in the first quarter which was followed by a power outage. We had a second power outage in the second quarter and in my view that\u2019s unacceptable. So we are working with the third-party power supplier to upgrade their systems, their networks, we are looking at what we can do within refinery to recover from one of these incidents quicker around our own systems and balances.","There is a co-gen unit at Sweeny, it\u2019s running sort 350,000 megawatt and we\u2019ve used about 125,000 megawatt at the complex. So we are looking to say, what can we do to island that facility, technically it\u2019s possible, practically difficult, but it can be done we\u2019re working and then finally we are working to get a second supplier power into that complex.","So that should be an event that is not repeated in the future. And so I think if you think for me personally and the biggest disappointment in the quarter was having a second power outage at Sweeny, which by the way impacts all the way across our businesses, so we had the refinery down, all the ethylene units were down, the frac was down. So it impacted all three business platforms that we had, and so we\u2019ll absolutely get that one fixed.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. And then how important safety is to you personally? If I could go to this weedy question on sensitivities and apologies, it\u2019s kind of to do with the comparison between this year and last year. One thing that stands out is that you seem to have flipped your sensitivity to the LLS brand differential from a positive last year to a negative, but that would imply obviously a widening discount of LLS to Brent. Last year would have been a negative, but this year is now positive.","Greg C. Garland","No, that\u2019s not right. I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s not true, I mean LLS prices weakening benefit us.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. It just seems to been the case last year that it was $30 million positive if LLS went up, now it's a $20 million negative?","Greg C. Garland","","Let us work on that, I mean we benefit on the Gulf Coast when LLS prices weaken relative to Brent that was true last year and that's true currently.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","All right, okay. I think we just have to take a look at the slides, you taking that I appreciate you probably don't have the 2012 slide in front of you. The other thing you've done is, you've dropped the sensitivity to WTI Brent differential. Is there any particular reason for that? I mean I understand that you've given plenty of detail here, but it's just one differential that's longer on that sensitivity.","Timothy G. Taylor","","Well, we've really broke that up between, we really think about it on inland crudes to Gulf Coast crudes. We have a WTI LLS sensitivity and then we have an LLS to Brent sensitivity. So, we think about it that way rather than going all the way from inland to international. But let us do some work, we understand that this quarter our number was quite a bit different from where a lot of analysts' numbers were and we take some responsibility in that to make sure that we're giving you the sensitivities you need to be better predictors of what our earnings are going to be.","What also is not on the sensitivities are the things that there was no way of you knowing was the relationship between the product prices that we've realized and what's implied by either LLS 321 or a Midcon 321 where we were using the Chicago-based products there. So, we are thinking about ways of providing additional sensitivity so that you guys are better equipped to predict what we're going to do on a quarterly basis, knowing that this business is complex and difficult to predict.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Yeah, I mean, I guess, you saw pre-announcements as well, is there any particular reason you didn't just pre-announce?","Timothy G. Taylor","","I don't think we really believe in pre-announcements. I don't think you really should expect us to do pre-announcements. We think sensitivities and the relationships we have with you guys is good enough to help you get to the right number.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. that\u2019s interesting. And then just, again just hammering on this point a little bit. The gas sensitivity has changed. Is there anything, nat gas sensitivities, is there anything particularly operationally going on with that or is it just a function of the basis between 2013 and 2012?","Greg G. Maxwell","","I don't know if it would be, that we have had trainer is or\u2026","Timothy G. Taylor","Well we\u2019ve done a lot of energy projects too\u2026","Greg G. Maxwell","That\u2019s true.","Timothy G. Taylor","That we\u2019re trying to capture this is a lower number now, I think, isn\u2019t it?","Greg G. Maxwell","Yeah.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Yes, it\u2019s quite a bit lower.","Greg G. Maxwell","But, let\u2019s take this whole sensitivity issue up with you offline and will see as\u2026","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, sure. I appreciate it kind of seriously in the weeds, if we look at the very big picture, this is the last thing from me. 3Q to-date, you've got the wider heavies, you have got wider Canadians, you have probably got less product prices on balance 3Q to-date is worse than Q2 or better than the throughputs?","","Greg C. Garland","","I mean you know better than the fact that we don't give quarterly guidance, and so, let's let the quarter unwind a little bit and see before we have\u2026","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But what I was saying is not quarterly guidance. It's month-to-date or quarter-to-date.","Greg C. Garland","I don't think we're going to give that.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, I\u2019ll drop it. Fair enough, Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys.","Greg C. Garland","Paul, good morning.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Greg, just want to maybe confirm, already are you saying that 100% of your RIN requirement is now currently showing up in your other cost or that whatever is the implied cost, they are showing up in your Refining business and that the 100% of whatever your Brent, you are showing up in your wholesale marketing result?","Greg C. Garland","That is correct, Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","The reason why I asked that is that, it seems now you are marketing if that's the case, the results should be much better and refining should be far worse. Based on your throughput level on gasoline and estimate on road diesel, you'll probably do above 1.2 million barrel per day to 1.3 million barrel per day and you export about 181,000. That target for 8.03% what's the requirement that would suggest that for the quarter, your RIN obligation is about 350 million gallons and that with the RIN costs in the second quarter about $0.80 to $0..85, it seems like should be a much bigger impact than for both your marketing business in terms of the earning impact of benefit as well as the negative impact on refining? So I think I must be missing something.","Greg G. Maxwell","","I will take a stab at it, and then turn it over to Tim. But as we said earlier with our commercial operations we are not going to signal to you whether we are balanced long or short Paul. But as far as the pure accounting perspective that is exactly right as I said earlier to the extent that we blend, we capture that positive value in marketing, specialties and subsequently transfer that cost at market value to our refining organization. So the full cost impact for the RINs obligation ends up in our refining segment.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Tim, earlier that you are talking about you have the flexibility on the well system. So with the volatility in the market piece how quickly that you can turn the volume and decide I am not going to ship into this location, I decide to ship into another location given your contractual obligation with the well operator and other people. Is it like 30 days that you can make the switch, is it three months, is it six months, any kind of rough number you can provide?","Timothy G. Taylor","Yeah, Generally, Paul, I would just say that you kind of pictured crude and you\u2019ve got a pretty time that it takes, but the option should develop in terms of the ultimate supplies. So this is shorter-term versus longer-term and then with our system, we have the flexibility to alter that probably as fast as we can move the crude slate. And I think that's the way we tend to look at that realizing that the industry on pipeline commitments et cetera that you\u2019ve got to schedule those out. So that really is something that you got, even the rail system quite a bit of flexibility with.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","So you \u2013 essentially if I interpret your statement correctly, you will be somewhere between one to three months because, I mean, if you look at the alternative or it probably doesn\u2019t take that much, it depends?","Greg G. Maxwell","","Yes. It depends, but it's probably on the shorter side of that.","","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Greg, just curious, one of your competitor was starting to build condensate splitter and use the natural gas in naphtha and then brent (inaudible) certainly your sensory that sort of a replacement of the light oil run in their refinery. Is there any opportunity for you guys along that line?","Greg C. Garland","So, we've looked at \u2013 I think we've said publicly, we are not going to build a standalone condensate splitter, but we do have opportunities at our Sweeny facility at Alliance, Lake Charles assets where we think we can make some modifications and actually process more light oil through these facilities and with minimal capital investment. That's still, I mean, but as we think about where we want to spend our money, we are looking for 40% return type projects on the refining side. And so we\u2019re looking for quick hit, fast payout projects. We have some underutilized equipment that we can kind of tie together and use that all and so we've got some projects around that that we are executing.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","When do you think that you may be able to sanction or provide more data on those projects?","Greg C. Garland","In terms of the increased throughout that we\u2019re looking at?","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","No, whether that you actually definitely go ahead with those projects and what kind of CapEx and what kind of throughput and what is the current benefit that you are looking at?","Greg C. Garland","","$30 million, $50 million type projects and they\u2019re underway.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","They are already underway.","Greg C. Garland","","Yes. We actually do things like tie-ins and turnarounds and some other things. So, it kind of depends on the schedule and things that are available, but those are our plans that we have in place to make those margin in some of our refining system already.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","What is the total capacity on the condensate splitter in those facilities that we are talking about?","Timothy G. Taylor","","This is really \u2013 I don't want to call it condensate splitter per se. It can just be \u2013 I will call it the flash system. So, there's just a variety of ways to approach, primarily trying to drive lights out ahead of the crude column. So, it's not a new column per se. It's really trying to see what's in the refinery to accomplish what you needed to increase the ability to take out those lights and then also looking at things to the \u2013 say, the gas plant capabilities to make sure that you can process that.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Okay, okay. If I can just make a proposal, I try to understand that Tim or Greg that what is the major difference in the RIN issue comparing to say the ethanol issue back several years ago. The industry had most of that when you build you customer and here we have in your invoice specifically identify how much you have charged on the outport and what is the passthrough of the ethanol price and given that everyone essentially have to pay for the RIN.","Why the industry is not moving into that direction, so that from the consumer standpoint and investment community standpoint we know that this is 100% passthrough and we won\u2019t get confused by the margin capture rate, because now that artificially the margin capture rate is lower since that part of the RIN cost is perhaps that in the, at the upward price already? And also that, I mean, if really you want Washington, D.C. to act on yen changes you need to have a process and need to make sure that the consumer speak up and provide a transparent way that seems is the more effective way to ensure something would get done in D.C. because the consumer then realize that how much they\u2019ve been getting.","Greg C. Garland","","Yes, I mean it isn\u2019t one approach and to be explicit on the pump would be a great way for the consumer to realize what that means. It\u2019s competitive pricing business and you are right. It has to be an industry kind of thing, but it would be an interesting approach to highlight that. And I think\u2026","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Because everyone \u2013 everything will refine regardless whether you have today balance or not, next year you probably will be short.","Greg C. Garland","","Hey, Paul, I don't think we disagree. We probably have to go onto the next question.","","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Greg C. Garland","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Arjun N. Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Thank you. Just a question as the Gulf Coast gets awash with light crude oil. Can you talk about your ability or capacity to reship that stuff to the East Coast, especially if the differential is warranted?","Greg C. Garland","","Yes, Arjun, we have taken the charters on two marine tankers that allow us to move that product today from the Southern Texas Coast to Corpus into our system. Clearly, as you go long haul of the East Coast the capacity drops because you got longer haul times, but I think it\u2019s all about the value and where do we drive the greatest value. So, that\u2019s the optionality we do. We do move from time to time cargoes from Texas up to Bayway, and so that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve done and we will keep open. That really is part of our optimization and I think whether use barge or other part marine will have to be a piece of the solution longer term on this.","Arjun N. Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Is there kind of a volume capacity you can do in order of magnitude, kind of cost or tariff to do that?","Greg C. Garland","Yes, I think we\u2019ve said in the past $4 to $5 a barrel movement on Jones Act vessel.","Greg G. Maxwell","Each vessel is about $300,000.","Greg C. Garland","Yeah. And so, depending on the length of haul, you are probably East Coast, we\u2019ve not given that, but probably more than in order of $20,000 a day and you get a much better utilization in the Gulf Coast. Clearly, if you are not using Jones Act vessel going to Canada, the costs drops to about half of that.","Timothy G. Taylor","","Our view is that because of the limitations of Jones Act vessel, that\u2019s going to push you to more barge and more rail just to evacuate the Gulf Coast.","Arjun N. Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","And I assume that it\u2019s Ho-Ho or when Ho-Ho reverses that will free-up barge capacity to increase volumes to the East Coast, just again if the differential [warrants] it?","Greg C. Garland","Right. That\u2019s part of what happens and as the supply increase in the Gulf Coast, clearly the Bakken is going to continue to clear the East and West Coast by rail.","Arjun N. Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Yeah, great. And then just a quick final one on stock buyback, a nice bump in Q2 versus Q1. Looking forward, do we think about this as sort of, if you have free cash flow that\u2019s the quantity? Are you kind of targeting a set amount or a debt-to-cap ratio? How do we think about the stock buyback go forward?","Timothy G. Taylor","Well, I think, as we said in the call today that we are going to finish the first $2 billion repurchase plan this year and that we\u2019ll get started on the reload this year also. So, we\u2019re in the market everyday, and you\u2019ll see us there. Some days we\u2019ll buy more than others obviously, but we really don\u2019t want to put out a set amount of what we're going to buy everyday Arjun.","Arjun N. Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","And going forward in the out years again free cash flow type metric is how we should think about it or debt-to-cap or both.","Greg C. Garland","I think we think about the intrinsic value of the company and we see we are trading now and as long as we are trading at a discount that we currently see to what we think we were we should expect us to be buying back shares.","Greg G. Maxwell","","We are going to pay the dividend. You should expect that we are going to increase the dividend every year and then to the extend that we have free cash and looks value accretive to us we\u2019ll take shares then.","Greg C. Garland","Arjun you saw that we did paydown the $500 million of the term loan we will finish out prepaying that term loan as I mentioned this year.

My name is Julie and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.","Jeff Dietert","Good morning, and welcome to Phillips 66 second quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today\u2019s call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Mitchell, Executive Vice President and CFO. The presentation material we will be using during the call can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our Q&A session. Actual results may differ materially from today\u2019s comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings.","In order to allow everyone the opportunity to ask a question, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg Garland for opening remarks.","Greg Garland","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $1.4 billion, or $3.02 per share. We generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow. We delivered solid operating performance and strong earnings during the quarter. Refining operated 97% utilization and captured favorable margins driven by improved gasoline cracks. In Midstream, growth projects completed over the past two years contributed to record segment earnings. During the quarter, we distributed $861 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We're dedicated to a secure, competitive and growing dividend and this quarter we increased the dividend by 12.5%. This is the ninth increase since our inception, resulting in a 25% compound annual growth rate.","Disciplined capital allocation remains fundamental to our strategy and we know that it creates value for our shareholders. Our long-term objective is to reinvest 60% of our operating cash flow back into the business and return 40% to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We'll buy our shares back when we trade below intrinsic value and we're buying shares today. Consistent with our strategy, we're executing a robust portfolio of Midstream growth projects with attractive returns. These new projects will provide us with continued future earnings growth.","During the quarter, we announced joint ventures to construct the Liberty and Red Oak Crude Oil Pipeline systems. These projects are backed by long-term volume commitments. The Liberty Pipeline will provide transportation from the growing Rockies and Bakken production areas in Cushing, Oklahoma. Liberty will have access to the Gulf Coast via the Red Oak Pipeline. We own a 50% interest and will construct and operate Liberty. The Red Oak Pipeline system will connect Cushing and the Permian Basin to multiple locations along the Gulf Coast, including Corpus Christi, Ingleside Houston and Beaumont. We own a 50% interest and will operate Red Oak. Both pipelines are in supplemental open season, seeking additional commitments with limited remaining capacity. The pipelines are targeted to begin initial service in the first quarter of 2021.","Phillips 66 Partners continues to construct the Gray Oak Pipeline. The 900,000-barrel per day pipeline will transport crude oil from the Permian and Eagle Ford to the Texas Gulf Coast including our Sweeny refinery. We received all major permits acquired all right of way and installed 80% of the pipe. The project remains on-track to start up in the fourth quarter this year. Phillips 66 Partners owns 42.25% interest in the joint venture. Gray Oak will connect with multiple refineries and export facilities in the Corpus Christi area including the South Texas Gateway Terminal in which PSXP owns 25% ownership. The terminal will have 2 deepwater marine docks, 7 million barrels of storage capacity and up to 800,000 barrels per day of throughput capacity. The terminal is expected to start up by mid-2020.","With Liberty Red Oak, Gray Oak and our existing network of pipelines, we will serve all the key shale oil-producing regions with connectivity to the major Gulf Coast market centers. Our pipeline network is integrated with our Central Corridor and Gulf Coast refineries as well as our Beaumont and South Texas Gateway Export terminals. We believe this integration is a competitive advantage that further enhances the value across our portfolio. We continue to expand the Sweeny Hub to meet increasing domestic NGL production and global market demand. We're moving forward with construction of a fourth fractionator that will have 150,000 barrels per day of capacity and is expected to cost approximately $500 million.","Frac 4 is backed by customer commitments and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021. Construction of Fracs 2 and 3 is progressing well and we're on track to start up in the fourth quarter of 2020. Upon completion of Frac 4, the Sweeny Hub will have 550,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity. In connection with our expansion at the Sweeny Hub, PSXP is increasing storage capacity at Clemens Caverns from 9 million barrels to 15 million barrels. Completion of expansion is expected in the fourth quarter of 2020. Also at the Sweeny Hub PSXP will construct a 16-inch ethane pipeline from Clemens Caverns to Gregory Texas.","The C2G Pipeline will serve petrochemical customers in the Corpus Christi area. The pipeline will have 240,000 barrels per day of capacity and is expected to be complete in mid-2021. In Chemicals, CPChem is expanding its strategic partnership with Qatar Petroleum to develop petrochemical assets in the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Qatar. Pending final investment decisions, these projects will add world-scale ethylene and high-density polyethylene in advantaged feedstock locations with access to global markets. This further enhances CPChem's leading polyethylene position to supply the world's growing demand for polymers.","In Refining, Phillips 66 Partners recently completed construction of its 25,000-barrel per day isomerization unit at the Lake Charles refinery that will increase production of higher-octane gasoline blend components. This unit is expected to reach full production in the third quarter. At the Sweeny refinery, we're upgrading the FCC to increase production of higher-valued petrochemical feedstocks and higher-octane gasoline. This project is on track to complete in the second quarter of 2020.","This morning we announced the elimination of incentive distribution rights at PSXP. This transaction improves PSXP's cost of capital, simplifies its capital structure and further aligns the GP and LP economic interests. Our ownership in PSXP will increase to 75% after the transaction closes. We believe the transaction is attractive for both Phillips 66 shareholders and PSXP unitholders. PSXP is a premier MLP and it remains a key component of our midstream growth strategy. So before I turn the call over to Kevin, we'd ask that you hold the date November 6th for an Analyst and Investor Day we'll be hosting in New York City.","With that, Kevin you can go through the financials.","Kevin Mitchell","Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on slide 4, we summarize our second quarter financial results. Adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion or $3.02 per share. Operating cash flow including working capital was $1.9 billion. Capital spending for the quarter was $631 million including $408 million on growth projects. We returned $861 million to shareholders through $406 million of dividends and $455 million of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 449 million shares outstanding.","Moving to slide 5. This slide highlights the change in pre-tax income by segment from the first quarter to the second quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings increased $1.2 billion, mostly driven by refining. All segments had improved results. The second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 20%.","Slide 6 shows our midstream results. Second quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $423 million, an increase of $107 million from the previous quarter. This quarter, we achieved strong results in the midstream segment, driven by record pre-tax income in both the transportation and NGL businesses. Transportation adjusted pre-tax income was $245 million, up $42 million from the previous quarter due to higher volumes on our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines and terminals.","NGL and Other adjusted pre-tax income increased $53 million, driven by higher margins and volumes at the Sweeny Hub as well as improved butane trading results. The Sweeny Hub had record earnings and strong operations during the quarter. The LPG export facility loaded a record number of cargoes and the Sweeny fractionator achieved utilization of 118%. DCP Midstream adjusted pre-tax income of $35 million in the second quarter is up $12 million from the previous quarter due to favorable hedging impacts.","Turning to chemicals on slide 7. Second quarter adjusted pre-tax income for the segment was $275 million, $48 million higher than the first quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pre-tax income was $260 million, up $41 million from the previous quarter. The increase reflects higher polyethylene margins, driven by lower NGL feedstock costs as well as lower utility costs related to falling natural gas prices. Global O&P utilization was 95%. Adjusted pre-tax income for SA&S increased $8 million following first quarter turnaround activity. During the second quarter, we received $190 million of cash and distributions from CPChem.","Moving to refining. The chart on slide 8 provides a regional view of the change in Refining's adjusted pre-tax income. Refining's second quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $983 million up $1.2 billion from last quarter. The increase was mostly due to higher realized margins and volumes. Realized margins for the quarter increased 57% from $7.23 per barrel to $11.37 per barrel, driven by higher gasoline cracks. Crude utilization was 97% compared with 84% in the first quarter. The first quarter was impacted by significant turnaround activity as well as unplanned downtime. The second quarter clean product yield was 84% and pre-tax turnaround costs were $67 million.","Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the second quarter was $15.24 per barrel, compared to $9.77 per barrel in the first quarter. Our realized margin was $11.37 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 75%. Market capture was impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We make less gasoline and more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. During the quarter, the gasoline crack increased 169%, while the distillate crack decreased 8%. Losses from secondary products of $1.35 per barrel increased $0.72 per barrel from the previous quarter due to declining NGL prices relative to crude, partially offset by improved coke margins.","Our feedstock advantage of $0.01 per barrel declined $2.07 per barrel from the prior quarter due to narrowing crude differentials. The other category reduced realized margins by $0.21 per barrel in the second quarter. This was improved $3.52 per barrel from the prior quarter, with the largest driver being clean product realizations.","Moving to Marketing and Specialties on slide 10. Adjusted second quarter pre-tax income was $353 million, $148 million higher than the first quarter. Marketing and Other increased $156 million from higher domestic and international margins, associated with falling spot prices during the quarter. Specialties decreased $8 million from primarily due to lower lubricant margins. Refined product exports in the second quarter were 187,000 barrels per day. We reimaged approximately 400 domestic-branded sites during the second quarter, bringing the total to approximately 3,300 since the start of our program.","Slide 11 shows the change in cash during the quarter. We started the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Cash from operations was $1.9 billion, which included a $251 million working capital benefit primarily related to inventory draws. During the quarter we funded $631 million of capital spending and returned $861 million to shareholders through $406 million of dividends and $455 million of share repurchases. Our ending cash balance was $1.8 billion.","This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items for the third quarter. In Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rates to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the third quarter crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and pre-tax turnaround expenses to be between $150 million and $180 million. We anticipate Corporate and Other costs to come in between $210 million and $240 million pre-tax.","With that, we'll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Neil Mehta","Good morning, team.","Greg Garland","Good morning, Neil.","Kevin Mitchell","Hi, Neil.","Neil Mehta","Good morning. The first question I had was, when I think about your CPChem business, historically you've been -- you've grown this business organically. And you've announced a couple of really good projects here, one in Qatar one in the Gulf Coast that kind of reinforces that historical strategy. There's been some press reports that the potential for you guys to do a large step-out type of transaction here, which I guess would be inconsistent with the historical way you have grown this business. So without asking you to kind of speculate here, anything you could do to sort of -- to clarify the way you think about building this business would be helpful for investors when we think about it?","Greg Garland","Great. Well, first of all, as a practice we just don't comment on market rumors or speculation. And even outside of chemicals when you step back and think across our entire portfolio, we followed an organic path over the last seven years. Where we've done things inorganically has been on the asset side. And so think about the Beaumont Terminal or the River Parish or SCOOP\/STACK or Plains. So we have been opportunistic on the in organic side from time to time. For us anything we would do inorganically would have to eventually compete with the returns, we can generate on the organic side. And as you read the report this morning, we have a really strong portfolio of organic opportunities. And so, I'll just leave it at that. I think we\u2019re like everyone we look at everything that's out there. We struggle to find things that we think that are accretive to returns, but we'll continue to look.","Neil Mehta","All right. Fair enough. And then a follow-up question is just NGLs have certainly come under a lot of pressure. And when we think about PSX on a consolidated level with all the moving pieces recognizing you have DCP and there's some element of product -- NGL product yield that comes off your refiners that you have a large ethane-consuming business and your chemicals business, how should we think about the company on a consolidated basis? Do you do better, if NGL prices are lower? ","Greg Garland","Well, I would start -- we're a net buyer of ethane at CPChem, so, I mean, low ethane prices definitely benefit our chemicals business. The lower propane prices given our export position and the strong arcs we're seeing particularly to Asia today that's a benefit for us on the LPG export side. There is impacted DCP across the DCP portfolio to lower NGL prices. So -- but on balance, we have offsetting across the portfolio.","Kevin Mitchell","I would say within the PSX and PSXP portfolio many of those pipes and fractionators are fee-based so we benefit from growing volumes, but not really exposed on the commodity side. With regard to DCP they've been successful converting some of their historical commodity price contracts to more fee-based contracts and they're hedged against the majority of their remaining exposure.","Operator","Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI, please go ahead.","Doug Terreson","Congratulations on your results guys. ","Jeff Dietert","Thanks, Doug.","Doug Terreson","In refining and marketing, Phillips 66 seems to be consistently outperforming peers due to several factors one of which may be higher volume. And on this point, one of your peers suggested recently that U.S. product demand may be exceeding government estimates and that positive revisions to demand may be forthcoming. So I wanted to see whether you share that view and to get your overall outlook for products demand in the U.S. and export markets too, please?","Jeff Dietert","Yes. I think when you look at the U.S. consumer, he is in pretty good shape low unemployment, healthy wage growth, consumer confidence, he\u2019s in good shape. We saw gasoline demand may be down slightly in the first quarter but it rallied and was up in the second quarter. The vehicle miles traveled up strong in April and up again in May. And so I think demand we're seeing is kind of flattish on the gasoline side year-to-date and what we expect in the back half of the year. On the diesel demand-side, we see it flat to slightly up and that's compared to very tough comps with 2018 diesel demand being up 6% year-on-year. So still very healthy demand on the diesel side as well.","I think as we went through the quarter and some of the flooding in the Mississippi River delayed and some of the planting there was -- the industry did finish strong. And so what we thought was going to be a loss of 70,000 or 80,000 barrels a day of demand in the planting season, maybe it was closer to 30,000 or 40,000 barrels a day. So that's been a little bit better than was feared.","Doug Terreson","Okay. Good summary, Jeff. And then in midstream it seems like there are a lot of share related takeaway export and processing projects planned by the industry, even though shale output growth is decelerating and future spending may have to decline further if E&Ps want to sustain current returns valuation and share prices. And of course if we were to ever have consolidation, E&P spending in output would be pressured over the medium term too. So my question is how does the company think about and manage the risk for scenarios such as this one such that perspective returns on investment in midstream are protected? ","Greg Garland","Well, I mean we start with partnering, so you see these big pipes, we've got partners in these pipes, strong partners. Secondly, when you look at the volume commitments, throughput commitments these are 7 to 10-year commitments with strong investment grade parties. And so that's the way we try to mitigate the risk Doug.","Doug Terreson","Okay. Thanks a lot, Greg.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Phil Gresh from JPMorgan, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Phil Gresh","Yeah. So, Greg it's been quite an active couple of months here for PSX with all these projects announcements in midstream and chemicals. So, I can certainly see why you signed for another Analyst Day to dive into that. But in advance of that event, I was hoping you could talk about what looks like a reaccelerated growth philosophy, especially given where we are in the economic cycle. Obviously we're a bit late in the cycle. And then perhaps Kevin, if you could help maybe detail out some of the financing plans behind these projects and help us think through how that fits with the 60\/40 band over the next couple of years? Thank you.","Greg Garland","Yeah. I'll just start at high level Phil. We recycle cash, we moved from kind of $4 billion to $5 billion to $6 billion to $7 billion. So if you just take the low end of the range at $6 billion and 60% reinvested you're kind of in $3.6 billion capital budget. So I think that we\u2019re going to -- within that in any given year, we could probably on balance above\/or below that. Certainly you've seen the past where we didn't have investable opportunities we pull CapEx way down. We like the suite of projects that we have. They're all very attractive returns and we think build value across the portfolio. So just from that standpoint I think we're consistent with what we've been saying for the past seven years in terms of kind of the 60\/40 investment return to shareholders kind of paradigm that we've been in. And we're comfortable with that. We think it's about right for the company.","As we've talked in the -- in Doug's question, we tried to mitigate the risk on these projects, certainly, by taking on partners, looking at volume commitments with good counterparties on the other end of that. Kevin will speak to the project financing. That's another way we use to de-risk these projects. So on balance, I think, we're positive about the organic profile that we have. We're positive about the cash generation of the company. We still think that the first dollar cash we generate is going to go to sustaining capital as $1 billion a year. Second, dollar is going to go to our dividend as $1.6 billion.","And then, we have options, but certainly, we can be within $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in terms of our growth to $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in terms of our share repurchases. And we can make that all fit within the existing cash flow. And Kevin, I'll let you talk to the project financing.","Kevin Mitchell","Yeah. Thanks. So just walking through a couple of these projects. Gray Oak, as we talked about in the past, we had communicated our intention to finance that and we closed on the financing in the second quarter. So that's $1.3 billion facility is in place and should effectively cover most of the remaining CapEx spend this year on that project. The Liberty and Red Oak pipelines, so on a gross basis, the numbers we put out there combined those two projects, that's just over $4.1 billion of CapEx. We are 50% in each of them. And while we haven't gone down the full project financing path yet, we've structured those projects to where they will be financeable. And it would be our intention to put project-level financing in place on those joint ventures also.","And then the other one, I'll just comment on is -- well, actually two more. So, also in Midstream, so we're constructing the \u2013 you\u2019ve got Fracs two and three under construction. We just sanctioned frac 4. Those are all being funded by us, so no financing in place on those projects. And that spend comfortably fits within the overall capital allocation framework, as Greg just outlined. And then just lastly on chemicals. So the two projects that were announced, bear in mind that these are not FID level yet, so there's still a ways to go. But given the structure with it, these being partnerships at the CPChem level, they should be amenable to financing.","Now, the reality is, you've got four parties and each with align around those funding plans. So within QP CPChem, us and Chevron need to align around that. But they should be structured in a way that if the owners are in alignment, then there's potential for financing around those. So, overall, when you put all this together, this still very much works in the context of our overall capital allocation framework.","Phil Gresh","That's very helpful. And just to clarify, Kevin. When you say project financing at the CPChem level, should we be thinking of some combination of free cash flow at the entity, plus maybe raising some debt there, plus maybe even project financing at the CPChem level?","Kevin Mitchell","Well, the reality is, it could be any or all of the above. So you have the potential at the project level. So if you take the Qatar project, or you take the Gulf Coast project, you have the potential to do two sort of projects level financing at that point. But there's also be potential for CPChem at the CPChem entity level to take on debt. They have a very strong balance sheet and so they have that capability as well. But all of these things require the sort of owner alignment around path forward on funding. ","Phil Gresh","Okay, great. And then just my follow-up would be to Neil's question, maybe more specifically on the refining business. Is there any additional disclosure you could provide around your exposure to products and NGLs and naphtha propylene and the like. I know others have been talking about it. And unless, I missed it I haven't seen any specific disclosure with your exposures there to help kind of think through the moving pieces? Thanks.","Jeff Dietert","Yes. So as we go through our secondary products, Kevin summarized it in the opening remarks. But when you look at the products that are there really naphtha is de-minimis within our refining products. NGL yield is about 4%. Coke yield about 4% and fuel oil yields between 2% and 3%. So those are the primary products. There are a lot of smaller products that are included in there as well, but that would give you a high level of our exposures to individual products within the secondary product category.","Operator","Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate","Thank you. Good morning everybody. Greg I don't want to front-run the November Analyst Day too much here, but it seems that the EBITDA mix of the company is going through another bit of a fairly rapid evolution as it relates to de-emphasizing refining. I'm just wondering if that read is correct, how should we think about the mix shift as we go forward and with a list of projects you've got right now in the mid-cycle basis where do you see refining stacking up relative to the rest of the portfolio? ","Greg Garland","Well, if you just kind of look at averages kind of 12 to 18. Refining is about $4 billion of EBITDA. Our midstream business is now about $2 billion. Our Marketing and Specialties is at $1.4 billion. Our distributions from CPChem about $1.2 billion. So when you think about $800 million of corporate and interest and then $1 billion or so of taxes that gets you to kind of that $6.5 billion of cash flow that we've been talking about. So that's kind of how we think about the portfolio. Certainly, we've made investments in the refining business, but they've been quick payout kind of lower capital items that we've chosen to invest in.","For instance, upgrading the FCCs, upgrading our billings of vacuum tower and though we generated a couple of hundred million dollars of EBITDA on our refining business through these investments. And we still have probably in the next three years another $300 million to $400 million of EBITDA coming our way from the investments we're making in refining. On the midstream side, if you want to look all the way through 2021, there's probably $800 million to $900 million of EBITDA coming in on the midstream business. So the strategy around growing our midstream, growing our chemicals business and investing smartly in our refining business has been the strategy over the last seven years and we're really not departing from that.","Kevin Mitchell","I don't know, Jeff, if you want to comment.","Greg Garland","..on the topic, Jeff, give me an A on that.","Kevin Mitchell","That was a good summary. Go ahead. ","Doug Leggate","No I was just going to say so, it looks to us, at least with the list of projects you've got right now before we consider further dropdowns, we're moving well under 50% of the portfolio for refining on a mid-cycle basis. Does that sound reasonable? Once these projects are complete? I mean once you've moved through -- I mean obviously, we haven't got definition on the chemical joint ventures yet. But with what you\u2019ve got going on in the midstream would it be fair to assume that refining is trending towards under 50% at the corporate mid-cycle EBITDA?","Greg Garland","Yeah. If you're excluding our Marketing and Specialties business from refining, I think that's probably a true statement.","Doug Leggate","Yes, I'm separating that out, right?","Jeff Dietert","Especially as you think 2020, 2021 time frame.","Doug Leggate","Okay. Thank you for that. My follow-up is actually a little -- I want to kind of, I guess go back a couple of years to some of the questions that used to come up around Tier 3 gasoline. Gasoline has, obviously, been a -- it certainly was our primary basis for being pretty cautious in the space the last couple of years. But it seems to us that with the chatter about potential VGO swing towards bunkers from next year and the three-year runway for Tier 3 gasoline kind of, I guess, coming to an end at the beginning of next year, are there grounds for a little bit more optimism that gasoline actually has some structural positives supporting, maybe offsetting a little bit the alignment of the crude slate there has lifted supply here. I'm just curious on your broader perspective as to whether Tier 3 and VGO issues amongst perhaps lower utilization rates across the industry can finally put a little bit of support under that market? And I'll leave it there.","Jeff Dietert","Yeah, I think Tier 3 is an excellent point with the average sulfur content last year over 20 parts per million and moving to 10 parts per million at the start of next year. The credits that are available -- Tier 2 credits are swelling the gasoline pool somewhat currently.","I think as you look at the IMO situation, it's still I think a challenge to figure out exactly how that's going to play out. It doesn't look to us as though there's going to be -- two million barrels a day of incremental diesel production to meet that incremental marine fuel market. And some is going to have to come from other products. And certainly some of that could be VGO. We're struggling to really predict what that percentage would be or how much of that total will be. But it should take some gasoline out of the gasoline pool.","I think with regard to Phillips 66, we're currently producing gasoline with the sulfur content comfortably below where the overall industry is. We are in good shape to meet the Tier 3 standards. The vast majority of the capital spending has already occurred and what little Tier 3 spending is left will fall within the normal range of our sustaining capital spend. When we look at premium gasoline, for example, we're upgrading more gasoline into the premium grade than the industry average and will benefit from a couple of growth projects. One, the 25,000-barrel a day Lake Charles isom unit, which is scheduled to come up this quarter as well as next year Sweeny FCC optimization. Both of them will allow us to increase premium gasoline production.","Operator","Roger Read from Wells Fargo, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Roger Read","Yes, good morning. Thank you. Thanks for the explanation on the gasoline side there, Jeff.","Jeff Dietert","You\u2019ve done some nice work on Tier 3 Roger.","Roger Read","Thank you. Thank you. Hoping maybe to change gears a little bit back to the midstream side. Great performance here in the quarter. I think back to when the Sweeny fractionator and the LPG export docks were first talked about, the numbers were pretty big. I'm wondering, when we go back to then, is that what we're now seeing? I mean 118% utilization of the fractionator obviously is a little bit beyond the typical budget. And then, with LPG volume exports at a record, we did get maximum there? I guess, what I'm kind of getting at is, was Q2 in that particular area as good as it gets or is there something else in the tank? And then, as a little extra to that, did we see operating leverage come through here with the additional throughputs and that's what really drove the margins?","Greg Garland","So, I think, in terms of the export facility in the frac, both are running at well above design rates. We're kind of at 200,000 barrels a day across the dock and we've had strong arbs in Asia and we had lower propane prices. So that's driven arbs and the profitability. We've seen dock fees bottom in the kind of the $0.05 to $0.06 range a couple of years ago and they were up in the kind of the low double digits in the second quarter. So you kind of had the -- if you will, the Sweeny Hub running, approaching kind of a $300 million annualized EBITDA run rate, which is at the low end of what we had thought when we approved the project.","We thought there'll be some room to play the arb above that and so we had numbers out there as much as $500 million. So we're still underperforming our expectations there, but certainly this is probably the best quarter we've ever had across the frac and the LPG export facility. There is some capacity coming on later this year and next year, but there's also another 1.4 million frac capacity coming on. And so, our view is that, the docks are going to be quite active over the next couple of years, needing to clear the propane to the export markets.","Jeff Dietert","Yes. We've seen healthy demand in Asia, new units coming on, widening the arb as well as strong supply domestically, as Greg mentioned. So that arb between the Gulf Coast and Asia, as well as Gulf Coast and Europe, has been widening. The shippers have taken disproportionate share of that but we're seeing some benefit there as well.","Kevin Mitchell","The one thing I'd add, Roger, as you think about Fracs two and three coming on in 2020, so next year, that provides some other additional uplift, because we'll be able to essentially fill out the export dock with the LPGs coming off the fracs. And so, we're not going to pay to move propane down from Belvieu and so you get some uplift at that point when those assets are complete.","Roger Read","Okay. Yeah. Thanks. That's really helpful. And then, back to one of the questions earlier, distributions from CPChem. I think, the number was $1.2 billion. As we look at the build-out of the facility in Qatar and in the U.S. and talked about the different financing. But should we think about that $1.2 billion as a pretty good baseline? Obviously, margins, operating levels will impact that, but that's a good baseline. It will be maintained even through the build-out and CapEx phase of these next two big projects?","Kevin Mitchell","Yeah. I think that's a reasonable base assumption to use. I mean, you hit the nail on the head that it's very much subject to what the margin environment's looking like, exactly what the spend profile of those two projects is. Remember, it's two major projects, but it's 50% of one and 30% of another. And so, on a cost basis, it's still less than doing one sort of world-scale Gulf Coast project. But for planning purposes, it's probably a reasonable assumption, but recognize there's just going to be a lot of moving parts as we get close to that point in time. ","Roger Read","Okay, great. Thanks. I'm looking forward to the Analyst Day and wondering Greg, if you're going to provide us that intrinsic value at the Analyst Day?","Greg Garland","You'll just have to come to find out Roger.","Roger Read","All right, appreciate it. Thank you.","Greg Garland","Take care.","Operator","Prashant Rao from Citigroup, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Prashant Rao","Thank you. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch back on one of the things that, Jeff mentioned in a previous answer about the uncertainty around how IMO 2020 gets resolved and get your views on some indications that we could be seeing commodity spreads and some other indicators that we\u2019re getting the first movement of an IMO 2020 sort of impact?","Specifically, isom for fuel has been tight but we are seeing time spreads in Asia try to widen out perhaps on the forwards. Storage rates for the high sulfur fuels more announcements of blended new compliant marine fuel.","It's a bit early still, but I think we're hitting that window where we were all expecting something to start to emerge in the coming months. But always appreciate your views on this tend to be more moderated and measured. So anything you'd have to share in terms of color would appreciate that.","Jeff Dietert","Yes. I think you're hearing more about the different blends. We are taking advantage of our Bartlesville technology center and testing blends there. We're expecting conversion of tanks in the September-ish time frame and expect shippers to be buying compliant fuels in the fourth quarter. I think there are some early indications of compliant marine fuels for CAO 2020, trading at $12 to $15 a barrel over Brent. There's not a lot of liquidity in that market. It's still early. We are starting to see inventories build. I've seen reports of up to 12 VLCCs in Singapore in anticipation of the transition.","So I think things are starting to move in that direction. I think it's still early to have a high degree of confidence exactly what impact it's going to have on diesel cracks, on compliant fuel, on high sulfur fuel discounts. But I do see it being a positive for the industry. It does substantially reduce the industry's footprint from an emissions perspective as well. ","Prashant Rao","Thanks. Appreciate that. The other question I have, let\u2019s touch back on the agriculture or the Ag exposure, given the weather issues in the quarter and it sounds like there's a strong finish to the quarter there which was nice to see. But wanted to get a sense of, if you can help us think about total exposure for -- economic exposure for Phillips as a consolidated entity there? And then as we think through the back half of the year in 2020, what's been missed in planning this year, one would assume if the pricing was there that would be making up for the planning next year. And so as we look out through the next call it 6, 12, 18 months can we get a sense of how we should be thinking about the cadence of that and maybe how material or not material, any upside impacts might be?","Jeff Dietert","I might take the first question. I think with regard to drivers, the global economy is a meaningful driver for product demand in our Refining business. It's a meaningful component to the chemicals business as well. I think with regard to Midstream, the major drivers there are production growth, U.S. shale opportunities there. So I think I would put those as the primary drivers for those three businesses.","Prashant Rao","I meant \u2013 sorry just to clarify with specifically with reference to the agricultural exposure, because we were hearing there could be a little bit \u2013 I mean you talked about the constant diesel demand that there was a little bit \u2013 there could have been a little but of impact on the distillates and fuel side what we are seeing in the U.S. from flooding issues. That didn't appear as much as we feared before. I was thinking more specifically about that. Sorry if I didn't clarify.","Jeff Dietert","Okay I apologize. Yeah, so from an industry-wide perspective, we were initially looking maybe 70,000 barrels a day and negative impact from the planning season as we were looking midway through or partway through the planning season. And the planning activity picked up at the end more than anticipated. And so I think the closer estimate is something like 30,000 or 40,000 barrels a day and that's industry-wide not specific to Phillips 66.","Operator","Paul Chang from Scotia Howard Weil, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Chang","Hi guys. Good afternoon.","Jeff Dietert","Hi, Paul.","Greg Garland","Welcome back.","Jeff Dietert","Welcome back, Paul.","Paul Chang","Thank you. Two questions if I may. One Greg or Jeff, on the IMO branding to the very low sulfur fuel oil, from Phillips standpoint, are you guys going to use the VGO as a primary ingredient or that you're trying to brand high sulfur fuel oil?","Jeff Dietert","So one of the challenges with the industry is that this is really a refinery by refinery evaluation. And I think as we look, we've got a number of different alternatives where as you know a high diesel yield portfolio within Refining. We've got another 25,000 barrels a day of diesel coming from projects that are underway. Those projects were justified with economics that didn't include IMO, but they will benefit from wider distillate cracks in an IMO environment. So there's definitely a diesel component to the way that we're approaching marine fuels. I think as we look at the VGO component, we see that as being challenging. Really what you're looking for are heavy barrels resid or diesel barrels that are low in sulfur. The naphtha and light barrels are not -- don't perform well in marine engines. The challenge is that most of your heavy molecules also tend to be sour and most of your light naphtha baste tend to be sweet. And so you're really looking for specific flows of VGO that might make sense in the marine fuel market. And I think those are tough to identify.","Paul Chang","Right. And I presume you guys have looked at the patent out there by Exxon and Shell and I assume that you guys believe you will be able to brand around that and not infringing their patents? ","Jeff Dietert","We have no intention of infringing anyone's patents. We're looking at our own blends and we will be able to participate in that market and our commercial people are open for business there.","Paul Chang","A final one for me. Greg, on CPC you've got that joint venture. I assume, that would mean your own -- the CPC-owned Gulf Coast second ethane cracker went up probably on whole, replaced by debt. Is that a strategic shift in the CPC? That's how, going forward, in terms of the expansion going to look like, or this is really just a one-off deal? ","Greg Garland","You're talking about the strategic partnership with Qatar on the Gulf Coast cracker?","Paul Chang","I'm sorry. Yes.","Greg Garland","It was just \u2013 I think it was an opportunity to do two projects and by partnering with a great partner that we've had a long relationship with, we're able to reduce risk, right? And to, share in two projects versus doing one. And we just -- we like the balance of risk from that investment opportunity that was given to us. So rather than picking one or the other, we found a way to do them both.","Operator","Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Manav Gupta","Hey, guys. A quick question. I want to focus on the Gulf Coast and specifically the capture on the Gulf Coast. You showed a higher capture quarter-over-quarter on the Gulf Coast. I'm trying to understand what were the drivers of the higher capture. As well as, if you could talk about how much of a role did Bayou Bridge actually play in that higher capture quarter-over-quarter on the Gulf Coast.","Jeff Dietert","Yeah. So as we look at when 1Q to 2Q, the -- we did have a fair amount of maintenance activity in the Gulf Coast in the first quarter with Lake Charles and Sweeny being down for turnarounds. And so that impacted capture rates. I think with the product pricing, clean product pricing, we saw improvement in the second quarter relative to 1Q as well. As we look at Bayou Bridge, it connects the -- or extends the DAPL pipeline into Beaumont and our facilities there and then Beaumont -- Bayou Bridge brings barrels up from Beaumont into Lake Charles. So that gets access to Lake Charles as domestic and Canadian barrels that are easily accessible by pipeline and we do see a benefit there from a Lake Charles Refining profitability perspective.","We've completed the expansion of a Bayou Bridge from Lake Charles to St. James which also opens up the ACE project that we've talked about, which would connect St. James to Clovelly and then into our Alliance Refinery as well. So we're looking forward to trying to keep the project moving forward as well.","Kevin Mitchell","Manav, it's Kevin. Just -- the big driver in terms of the capture quarter-over-quarter was the turnaround activity in Q1. So a fair amount of activity across the Gulf Coast system in Q1 that you didn't see to near the same extent in the second quarter. ","Manav Gupta","Perfect. A quick follow-up is that, I think Sonoma made some comments that Wood River could have done even better because of flooding there were pipeline outages and other problems. I'm just trying to understand, if there's a number in terms of that you can give us as to how much better Wood River could have done had those flooding issues not happen?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes. That's a true statement. Wood River was impacted by flooding in the quarter. But that's not something we're going to give a sort of what-if type number around. ","Operator","Justin Jenkins from Raymond James, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Justin Jenkins","Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. I guess, I want to start just going back to Doug's question on maybe Midstream risks and even beyond whatever might happen on commodity prices. It does seem like it's just become harder to build pipelines. So maybe just want a sense of your comfort level with the routing plans specifically for Red Oak and Liberty and maybe you might -- how you might address any potential construction issues, if there are any?","Greg Garland","I think certainly there's -- been many pipelines constructed without an issue. And I think that you get out early and you work with all constituents. Along the route, you pick the best route to go there and so that's what our company does. We'll be obviously executing on Liberty, Plains likely to be executing on Red Oak in terms of the construction. On Gray Oak, I think that the guys doing that, did a great job in terms of - we're 80% pipes in the ground it was really had no major issues there along that right of way. So we're expecting that -- these will be executed well and we'll deal with issues, if they come up when they come up. But I think part of it is just being living our values every day and working with safety on our commitment in mind with all the folks in all positions along the right-of-way areas. But we believe, we'll get it done. ","Justin Jenkins","Understood. Appreciate that Greg. And follow-up here is on PSXP here with the IDR issue resolved. Does it change anything in terms of maybe the scope of organic growth that PSXP can pursue or maybe how you're thinking about dropdowns or is this just the next step in evolution here? ","Greg Garland","I guess this is the next step in evolution of the MLP. Thinking back over the past 18 months, I don't think I've had a conversation with investors when they haven't encouraged us to do something with the IDRs. And just from a simplification standpoint, structure cost of capital et-cetera even though we haven't gone to the equity markets since 2017. But if you think about for an LP investor, if we do a 10% return project at PSXP we\u2019re effectively getting a 5% return. And so it does impact cost of capital even organic for our LP unitholders. And so we just need to restructure that.","We're trading at 6% to 7% yield and that's kind of 15 times multiple \u2013 and to the sum of the parts that PSX. We're going to be incented to grow the master limited partnership to the extent that it can. And as you can see we're executing essentially $1.3 billion worth of projects today. And this year of course with a project financing that gets cut down towards $700 million in terms of cash out the door. But still we'll put as much growth as we can into PSXP as long as it make sense and the multiples would incent us to do that.","Operator","Matthew Blair from Tudor Pickering Holt, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Matthew Blair","Hey, Greg your Chems business outperformed peers in Q2. What do you think the drivers were behind that? And then also could you share your near-term outlook for U.S. ethane and PE prices just given all the new fracs, crackers and PE plants on that?","Greg Garland","Well, I think that you kind of look at CPChem's portfolio if you want to think about performance relative to the peers, so assets primarily in the Middle East and in the U.S., assets that are primarily LPG or ethane-based. And so those margins have certainly been very good relative to say naphtha crackers in Asia or Europe. So it's really the geographic base of the assets. CPChem ran well certainly during the quarter that always helps. In ethane, I can't give you a forecast on the pricing for ethane because it would be wrong. But I would say as we still think there are 600,000, 700,000 barrels a day of ethane rejection. Today we got 1.4 million barrels a day of frac capacity coming on this year and next year.","So there will be more ethane available. You also have some projects in startup mode, although some of them are probably slower than what people have thought. And so we'll just have to put all that together but our view is that ethane is going to be available out into the next few years. Ethane is going to be attractively priced relative to the heavier feeds globally and that the Middle East and the U.S. Gulf Coast assets will be very, very competitive on the global stage.","Matthew Blair","Sounds good. And then IHS shows CPChem as net long U.S. ethylene by about 600 KT. Could you talk about, what you do with your excess ethylene today? Is that sold on a contract basis into the domestic market or exported on a spot basis? And would you consider any ethylene derivative projects to reduce the net length?","Greg Garland","Yeah. So we have one of the smaller ethylene units at Sweeny shut down today. So I'd tell you we get to mid-90s on operate. So our intent would be to bring that unit back up at the appropriate time. Certainly CPChem has the bottleneck opportunities to take care of some of that length out in the future and they have plans on deck to make investments and in terms of the debottlenecks around that olefins, polyolefins, alpha olefins chain that CPChem has today. So we don't look at the length as a big issue. There are some spots sales or contractual sales I should say in the ethylene business from CPChem. But primarily our strategy has been to pair the derivatives with the ethylene capacity over the long-term.","Operator","Jason Gabelman from Cowen, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jason Gabelman","Yeah, hey thanks for taking the question. It looked like equity affiliate distribution cash was a drag on the quarter, or a bit lower at least than we had anticipated. Was there any timing issues there for -- on the distributions from the affiliates in 2Q?","Kevin Mitchell","Yeah, Jason it's Kevin. Really not, I mean it's -- the equity earnings were $640 million, $648 million, the distributions were just over $500 million. That's not too far off of what you would normally expect. I mean, generally speaking, the -- you would expect the distributions to be a little bit less than the equity earnings, given that those equity affiliates have CapEx, their own capital programs to fund as well. And so, I don't think there's anything significant there. I think the \u2013 it was a little bit different. I think, you had some disproportionate distributions in the first quarter that head back, go the other way. And so, when we look at this on a year-to-date basis, it's all very reasonable from how we look at the cash flow.","Operator","Thank you. We have now reached the time limit available for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff. ","Jeff Dietert","Thank you, Julie. I would like to remind you again, put November 6 on your calendars, Analyst and Investor Day in New York City.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Kevin, you may begin.","Kevin Mitchell","Thank you, Mike. Good morning and welcome to the Phillips 66 third quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Chairman and CEO, Greg Garland; President, Tim Taylor; EVP and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Maxwell; and EVP, Clayton Reasor.","The presentation material we\u2019ll be using during the call can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website along with supplemental, financial and operating information.

Actual results may differ materially from today\u2019s comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here on the second page as well as in our filings with the SEC.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg Garland for some opening remarks.","Greg Garland","Thanks, Kevin. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. We had a strong quarter across all of our business segments. Adjusted earnings were over $1.6 billion or $3.02 per share. This represents a second best earnings quarter since our formation. Our global refining business ran well increasing utilization to 96% and capturing the benefit of strong market cracks.","Our U.S. Gulf Coast refineries ran at 100% for the quarter. Refining also had its second best earnings quarter. Marketing earnings increased in the quarter reflecting continued strong gasoline demand. In midstream we are approaching the period were our growth project start to come online. Sweeny Fractionator One is almost complete and should start up by the end of the year.","Our Freeport LPP export terminal is 60% complete its contract on budget and we expected to start up in the second half of 2016. The Dakota Access and ETCOP pipeline projects continue to make good progress and remain on schedule. Our master limited partnership Phillips 66 Partners remains an important part of our midstream growth strategy that we believe we will create value for both PSX shareholders and also PSXP unitholders.","As we announced this morning our interest in the Bayou Bridge Pipeline project will be acquired by Phillips 66 Partners. Once complete this project is expected to provide consistent fee-based earnings and support of PSXP stated growth objective of a five-year 30% distribution CAGR through 2018.","In September we announced our plan to contribute capital to DCP Midstream, provide additional support to the business during the current low commodity price environment. We expect that this cash infusion along with specters asset contribution will allow DCP to bring its credit metrics back in line and to support its growth objectives through the commodity cycle. We anticipate the DCP will be self-funding going forward.","In chemicals CPChem offset lower cash chain margins by running at higher utilization rates during the quarter. Development continues on CPChem U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals project, which is now about 60% complete with start a planned in mid-2017, this project remains on track. We had another strong cash flow quarter generating over $1.4 billion in cash from operations.","We use $1 billion of that cash flow on capital primarily to support midstream growth and maintain offer and integrity in our refining system. We recently announced our 2016 capital budget of $3.6 billion including $314 million PSX plans to spend our combined capital budget for 2016 will be $3.9 billion. As with this year the majority of growth capital will be spent on developing our major midstream growth projects.","In addition, almost $400 million is being allocated capturing high return quick payout opportunities in our refining business. We also continue to return capital to shareholders. During the third quarter we returned nearly $700 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. In addition, we announced an incremental $2 billion the share repurchase authorization. To date we\u2019ve completed $6 billion of the 9 billion in share repurchases authorized by our board and we\u2019ve increased our dividend a 180% since May 2012.","Before I turn the call over to Greg Maxwell to review this quarter\u2019s results, I think it\u2019s appropriate that we pause for just a minute and thank Greg Maxwell for 35 great years. He will be retiring at the end of this year; he\u2019s been a terrific CFO. He\u2019s been a leader; he\u2019s been a mentor to just so many people in our company. He\u2019s been a valuable part of our executive leadership team helping us to stand up a new company flawlessly and importantly to me he\u2019s been a great friend for 35 years.","So, Greg thanks for all you\u2019ve done for the company and helping to make this a great place to work and maybe just one more time take us through the numbers.","Greg Maxwell","Thank you, Greg. Good morning everyone. Staring on Slide 4, third quarter adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion or $3.02 per share; reported net income was also $1.6 billion but does include several special items that we excluded from adjusted earnings. These special items negatively impacted earnings by $69 million and include $46 million in pension settlement expense, $22 million in assets and goodwill impairments and a $19 million contingency accrual.","These items were partially offset by an $18 million gain on an asset sale. Excluding negative working capital changes of $33 million cash from operations was $1.5 billion. Capital spending for the quarter was $1 billion with approximately $700 million being spent in Midstream on growth projects and $200 million in refining.","Dividends and share repurchases in the third quarter totaled $673 million which brings our total shareholder distributions for the year to nearly $2 billion. At the end of the third quarter our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio excluding Phillips 66 partners was 25%. And after taking into account our ending cash balance, our adjusted net debt-to-capital ratio was 12%. The annualized adjusted return on capital employed through the third quarter was 15% and excluding special items our adjusted effective income tax rate was 32%.","Slide 5, compares third quarter adjusted earnings with the second quarter by segment. Overall quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were up $645 million mainly driven by increased earnings in refining and marketing and specialties. Next we\u2019ll cover each of the segments. I\u2019ll start with midstream on Slide 6, offering businesses within midstream improved their performance in the third quarter.","Transportation benefited from higher volumes and lower cost while NGL margins improved due in part to propane and butane margins and seasonal storage. Included in the transportation and NGL results is the contribution from Phillips 66 partners. During the quarter, PSXP contributed earnings of $31 million to the midstream segment.","DCP midstream continues to work on itself help initiatives to reduce costs, to manage portfolio and restructure contracts. Results this quarter were improved largely due to better marketing margins and higher volumes despite lower NGL and crude prices. In addition we completed the announced $1.5 billion capital contribution to DCP earlier this morning.","Annualized 2015 year-to-date adjusted return on capital employed for this segment was 5% based on an average capital employed at $6.1 billion. The return for this segment continues to reflect the impact of lower commodity prices on DCP Midstream results as well as increased capital employed driven by the significant growth investments we are making in our Midstream segment.","Moving on to Slide 7, Midstream\u2019s third quarter adjusted earnings were $91 million up $43 million from the second quarter. Transportation earnings for the quarter were $77 million up $12 million from the prior quarter. Transportation benefited from increased equity earnings from the Explorer and REX pipelines due primarily to increased volumes.","Transportation also benefited from lower costs.","Increased earnings from our NGL business were driven by higher margins and inventory impacts. Adjusted losses for DCP Midstream were lower in the third quarter mainly due to improved marketing margins and a second quarter loss on the Benedum asset sale offset partially by lower commodity prices.","Now turning to chemicals on Slide 8. The Global Olefins & Polyolefins capacity utilization rate for the quarter was 94% and for SA&S they were negatively impacted by lower margins and lower volumes. The 2015 annualized year-to-date adjusted return on capital employed for our Chemicals segment remained at 21% and this is based on an average capital employed of $4.9 billion.","As shown on Slide 9, third quarter adjusted earnings per chemicals were $272 million down from $295 million. In Olefins & Polyolefins the decrease of $6 million was largely due to second quarter insurance proceeds of $28 million and lower cash chain margins in the third quarter. This was partially offset by higher volumes and lower operating costs. Equity affiliate earnings improved as a result of higher margins.","Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics earnings declined to $17 million on lower equity earnings and lower volumes. That equity earnings decrease was partially due to lower margins.","Next, we turn to refining. Realized margins were $13.96 per barrel for the quarter driven by strong market conditions. Market capture increased from 62% to 72% in the quarter due to improved clean product differentials and lower losses on secondary products. This was partially offset by tighter crude differentials and our clean product configuration which yields less gasoline and more distillates then it is implied in the 321 crack spread.","Refining crude utilization increased to 96% up from 90% in the second quarter and clean product yields were 84% consistent with our average system configuration. Pre-tax turnaround costs were $69 million as compared to guidance of approximately $120 million due primarily to the deferral of some plant maintenance in the future periods. The annualized 2015 year-to-date adjusted cap return on capital employed for refining was 21% and this is based on an average capital employed of $13.6 billion.","Moving to the next Slide. The refining segment had adjusted earnings of $1.1 billion up $448 million from the last quarter. Overall, the improvement this quarter was primarily due to higher clean product differentials and increased volumes. Adjusted earnings were higher than the second quarter in every region except for the Western Pacific. Atlantic Basin adjusted earnings benefited from lower controllable costs, better realized European margins and higher volumes resulting from the completion of the Humber turnaround early in the third quarter.","The Gulf Coast region adjusted earnings were up from last quarter due to higher clean product differentials as well as increased volumes. The capacity utilization for this region was 100% in the third quarter. For the Central Corridor, we showed significant improvement due largely to higher margins from gasoline and secondary products, as well as wider differentials on Canadian crudes. This was partially offset by lower volumes due to turnaround activities at Ponca City and Wood River.","And for the Western Region, we had a slight decrease in adjusted earnings due to lower margins and inventory effects. This was mostly offset by higher volumes. The lower margins are due in part from the continued supply impacts on our San Francisco refinery as a result of the plant\u2019s pipeline outage.","Next, we will cover market capture on Slide 12. Our worldwide realized margin was $13.96 per barrel versus the 321 market crash of $19.51 resulting in an overall market capture of 72% compared to a market capture rate of 62% last quarter. Our configuration allows us to produce roughly equal amounts of distillate and gasoline which reduced our realized margin relative to market as the gasoline crack was significantly higher than the distillate crack.","Benefits from feedstock advantages were not high enough to fully offset the impact of secondary product losses despite fall in crude prices relative to coke and other secondary product prices. This was due primarily to tighter crude differentials this quarter. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, ongoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. The $2.71 per barrel increase versus the second quarter was driven primarily by stronger product differentials and lower RIN prices.","Moving on to marketing and specialties. This segment posted another strong quarter thanks to higher global marketing margins, record marketing volumes and continued strong margins in our lubricants business. Annualized 2015 year-to-date adjusted return on capital employed for M&S was 33% on an average capital employed of $2.9 billion.","Slide 14 shows adjusted earnings for M&S in the third quarter of $344 million up $162 million from the second quarter. In marketing and other the $157 million increase was largely due to higher margins and both domestic and international marketing. Specialties adjusted earnings increased $5 million due to widening basal DGO spread.","Moving on to corporate and other. This segment had after tax net costs of $112 million this quarter and improvement of $15 million from the second quarter. Net interest expense and corporate overhead decreased while other improved largely due to fixed assets write-offs that occurred in the second quarter.","Next I\u2019ll talk about our capital structure. Consistent with prior quarters we\u2019re showing our capital structure both with and without Phillips 66 Partners. As shown on the graph on the right, excluding partners we ended the quarter with an adjusted debt balance of $7.9 billion, an adjusted debt to capital ratio of 25% and a net to capital ratio of 12%.","Slide 17 shows our year-to-date cash flow for 2015. We began the year with the cash balance of $5.2 billion and excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations was $4.1 billion. Working capital changes resulted in a net positive impact of $100 million. In the quarter we issued $1.1 billion in debt and approximately $400 million in equity at the PSXP level.","We also retired $800 million in debt. We\u2019re funded $3.3 billion of capital expenditures and investments with $2.4 billion spent in midstream and nearly $800 million in refining. We also distributed $2 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and the repurchase of $14.5 million shares resulting in $533 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. And we ended the quarter with the cash balance of $4.8 billion.","This concludes my discussion of the financial and operational results. Next I\u2019ll cover a few outlook items. For the fourth quarter in chemicals we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In refining we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to also be in the mid-90s and pre-tax turnaround expense to be approximately $150 million, which includes the impact of maintenance activity that was delayed from the third quarter. This brings our full-year guidance on turnaround expense to approximately $550 million down from our original full-year guidance of $624 million to $675 million.","In corporate and other we expect this segment\u2019s after-tax cost to between $110 million and $120 million as we previously guided. And company-wide we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s. We are revising our 2015 capital expenditure guidance to $5.8 billion this is up from $4.6 billion to reflect our expected capital spending of $4.3 billion plus we announced $1.5 billion cash contribution to DCP.","With that we\u2019ll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Edward Westlake","Yes, good two questions. Firstly on the broader macro picture on demand, I mean chemicals margins have been doing pretty well. Dow was saying that they think actually utilization is going to get tighter over the next few years despite everything we hear out of China and fears about the global economy. So maybe just some comments on what you see on chemicals then I\u2019ve got a follow-on midstream?","Tim Taylor","This is Tim. I think we look chemicals and the utilization rates continue to be fairly good. We don't see excessive inventories at the converter level. And we\u2019re continuing to see good demand in Asia and across the system globally. So I think our view is demand is good. China is particular interest I think largely because of the reported numbers that what we see on both fuels and chemicals tells us that the consumer side of China is doing very well.","So our view is supply demand on the basic petrochemical will probably likely continue to tighten. But offset somewhat with the narrow differentials spread between ethane and naphtha, which keeps the cost advantage in the Middle East and the U.S. still there but narrow then it was a year or two ago.","Edward Westlake","Thanks very clear. And then obviously NGL fracs are awful. You've got a big frac export complex coming up next year with I think guidance of $400 million to $500 million which I think that the frac is the smaller part and then the export. So are you still comfortable with that sort of a reasonable range or do you need to see some commodity price improvement to hit that kind of number?","Tim Taylor","Our guidance is still the $ 400 million to $500 million. The frac should start up later this year with the LPG terminal hitting in third and fourth quarter of next year. And these, again our fee-based commitments in large part on both the terminal and the frac that are supported by TNB agreements so it gives us some assurance around that piece.","The variable piece really comes in terms of the market capture between the U.S. export price and the international markets on the export that are still open today. And so I think that's the one piece of the - that why we give guidance of the $400 million or $500 million.","Edward Westlake","Thanks, very clear.","Operator","Paul Cheng from Barclays is on the line with a question.","Paul Cheng","Hey, guys good morning.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Paul Cheng","First of all, just want to say thank you to Greg. We appreciate to have you over the last several years. Congratulation on retirement. I hope you have a lot of fun.","Greg Maxwell","Thank you, Paul.","Paul Cheng","And I think I have two questions. On the MLP sector it\u2019s no secret that evaluation have dropped a lot over last several months. Also U.S. onshore production has been in decline since probably April. Some of your peers in the MLP size start to suggest that the industry may have over invested in some area of infrastructure. I guess the question is that do you agree with those assessment and that's the recent change in the market environment that in any shape or form alter your view about your pace of the investment in the area of the dropdown pace, what are the M&A opportunities?","Tim Taylor","Yes, I think we agree broadly that yield structure has moved in the MLP space. We kind of reiterate our guidance and standby $1.1billion of EBITDA by 2018 will be at the MLP level, we feel pretty comfortable with the $2.3 billion of EBITDA we gave at your conference earlier this year, Paul as you think about it, but $1.9 billion that is either existing or projects under construction so the additional $400 million half of that probably come from frac, which to - which we\u2019re going to FID 2016, we go really good about that.","The balance of that\u2019s going to come from other NGL refined projects that we have in the portfolio. So I\u2019d say first of all we feel good about the $1.1 billion getting into the MLP by 2018. Other thing I think about to is I think high quality MLPs I think of the pairing of PSX and PSXP strong balance sheet, strong portfolio, existing EBITDA can be dropped. We have a great suite of organic projects that we think are really good projects that we\u2019ll bring forward and execute well on.","So we think investors will like that story and continue to want to be part of that story going down the road. And then we look at our cost of capital PSXP today is trading 3% let\u2019s say and we look at the returns on the projects we have in the portfolio that\u2019s a very attractive spread enabling us to create substantial shareholder value. So I would say we are watching what\u2019s going on in most P space with interest, but we think we have a strong story that investors going to like.","Paul Cheng","How about the pace of the job done I think that you\u2019ve been talking about $2 billion a year given the market condition, do you still think that that's doable or that at least for the immediate future that you probably go for is at slower pace?","Greg Garland","I think we are on track, we are on pace. I mean to achieve the one, one you\u2019ve kind of nailed the number that we need to do. We said it\u2019s going to be lumpy and as we go through the period, but on average that\u2019s about what it will be.","Paul Cheng","Okay. And final one from me. Have you seen any slowdown in the export market for gasoline and diesel and also that based on your network, you wholesale network in the U.S. what kind of a gasoline or diesel growth rate that you may be seeing? Thank you.","Greg Garland","Kevin, why don\u2019t you take that?","Kevin Mitchell","Paul, I maybe address the market question first. I think as we\u2019ve look out to the year that 3% or so growth in gasoline is very consistent with what we see. The global demand is up as well with particularly strong growth in Asia on the gasoline side. We\u2019ve had good placement opportunities in the U.S. in the last several quarters and I\u2019d say that the export markets are there particularly on the distillates side for the U.S. to export to and so that presents a nice option for us as we think about how do we optimize product values in our system.","Paul Cheng","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","Hey, good afternoon guys. I wanted to congratulate Kevin as well and wish Greg the best, it sounds like more time for the GreenAg in 2015 Greg.","Greg Garland","Thank you, Evan.","Evan Calio","My first question on refining, your earnings were over $1 billion or $400 quarter-over-quarter, last time over $1 billion and refining was in 3Q of 2012 when differentials were meaningfully higher. Can you elaborate on the factors that contributed to the quarter besides lower turnaround activity, because I know that over the past two years you had every turnarounds and reliability issues [indiscernible] and alliance. Just wondering if we should assume that these results indicate some of those problems are behind you?","Greg Garland","We ran very well so we are up 130,000 barrels a day on the crude side so six point improvement in utilization rate and I think that speaks to the fundamentals on that. And I would say that the product side has been the part that really help the refining complex, so it\u2019s really a view I think for the demand side and the strength of that and then that support staff. I would say gasoline, our view would be - will continue to be strong obviously with some seasonal effects, but literally from our perspective a strengthening market with this kind of price structure on the crude side.","Distillate remains weaker, but still able to capture that, so I think the story has been around the market improvement running well and those two combine do that. We\u2019ve also have an investment program to structure improved refining with some of the high return projects with the billings crude, optimization project, increasing the capability of our FCC at Bayway and other kinds of projects like that that will structurally add to our target of another $850. We have $850 million of EBITDA growth through 2018 so it\u2019s a combination of self-help, running well in a good market conditions. So I think that\u2019s our view of how we\u2019ve continue to contribute to our higher structure.","Evan Calio","That\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","Thank you. Good morning and congratulations to everybody on the - I guess we\u2019ll call them future roles even for you Greg. Just like to get in a little bit follow-up on couple of the questions have been asked. On the MLP side, obviously the question about dropdowns some challenges in that space. Do you look at it as something you be willing to do more on the acquisition side I wasn't clear from the answer earlier if that was a possibility. And I'm thinking more the traditional fee-based assets not some of the more assets here exotic I think things we\u2019ve seen.","Greg Garland","Well, I think in terms of acquisitions the PSXP level we look at everything that\u2019s out there. I think we feel pretty strongly that our organic profile that we have where we can essentially build something for seven and trade up into a higher value creates more value for both unitholders and for shareholders of PSX. But we saw something out there we thought added value for both PSX and PSXP unitholders then I think we would be one to consider that.","Roger Read","Okay that helps. And then in the refining side of the business as you\u2019ve mentioned in prior calls and in this one you have a higher distillate yield in a typical crack spread would indicate. Gasoline demand clearly growing faster than diesel demand excuse as we look at recent past and I think kind of the expectations here in the near-term future. Is there anything you would do to change your gasoline diesel yields as we look into the summer of 2016 or maybe another way of asking it what is it that you can change on the yield side and that kind of the short timeframe?","Greg Garland","First of all, we're running max gasoline have been all years I think were about 41% gasoline and 38% distillate. So typically we would run it the other way around 41% distillate. So we\u2019re run in max gasoline today, some of the projects that we have the Tim mentioned that both billings and also Bayway are around yields in improvement and so we are prior makes more gasoline and more distillates out of those projects, but at the margin that\u2019s what we will do we are not going to make just big investments to try to chases at this point in time. Given we think we have better opportunities in midstream in chemicals.","Roger Read","Okay so near-term no particular additional flexibility on the gasoline volumes or diesel.","Greg Garland","No.","Roger Read","Okay thank you.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","The next question is from Blake Fernandez with Howard.","Blake Fernandez","Guys, good morning and nice results today also offer congratulations to both Greg and Kevin. I had question on DCP, I think the comment was made that you believe it will be self-funding go forward. I am just curious if you can offered to - did that contemplate the current environment or is that just an anticipation that the current cash infusion and then the more stable revenue stream should kind of get you through this difficult pattern and move to more normalized market.","Greg Garland","I think that\u2019s the answer that we would give you clearly you know as we\u2019re delivering the balance sheet interest expenses going to go down. DCP is done a great job in terms of reducing costs you know reducing capital spend there also that I would say you know they're working hard to cover further third of the equity linked and from present of proceeds essentially to fixed fee. And so you kind of roll all that together and it kind of moves there breakeven from say mid-65% range down about where we are today. So I think we feel pretty good about that.","Blake Fernandez","Okay thanks. And then one follow up if I think you pretty tackle the midstream outlook and I understand fully that\u2019s you got the dropdown potential but I guess what I am wondering is there as you kind of digest the current assets that are being constructed is there potential to maybe reduced the amount of capital spending there on a go forward basis I guess what I am asking the total CapEx of $3.6 billion does that - move down as we progress toward 2017, 2018, 2019?","Greg Garland","We don\u2019t like to give guidance quite that far out, I think we are going to be in the $2 billion a year range in midstream through that that period of time. So the things we have in-flight today are pretty clear to see as you start thing about 2018, 2019, 2020 I would say there is probably reshuffling of the project deck and you will see is more NGL more refined products, more crude things right around our existing assets as we sort through where the drill bits going to go, but I mean our view consistently remains by 2017 and 2018 that really sort itself out and we are probably not $50 crude environment but we are probably not $100 but somewhere $60, $70, $80 in that range.","And so I think that one sent drilling and we will see a pickup of infrastructure back on that side. I think our base view at this point we have the juice in our portfolio so to speak that\u2019s going to push us through that period of time.","Blake Fernandez","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","Hi, guys I am back. Sorry, maybe operator is short.","Greg Garland","Welcome back.","Evan Calio","So my second question was on - if I look at the 2016 CapEx guidance, I know your midstream is down 924 and then PSX is up can you elaborate on the shift there? And I presume as, I presume as you move forward, you did expect PSX would take on more projects versus kind of building PSX and dropping them down to PSXP?","Greg Garland","I will take a stab and Tim can follow-on, there is the question why we said many times and we want to get PSXP to scale. So they can start doing its own organic investments Bayou Bridge was a great opportunity to give PSXP a great organic project and so I think what time you will see us try to grow that ability to do organic products at PSXP, there is no question, we think that makes a lot of sense.","We\u2019re still willing to incubate projects at top and take them as it makes sense. Frac is a great example $1 billion plus investment that\u2019s a little big for PSXP today. But in the future we\u2019ll do more and more organic there.","Tim Taylor","I just think, Evan, that having a sponsored MLP let\u2019s just tackle much bigger, stronger projects that ultimately can be tested for the MLP and as Greg said we plan to continue to do a nice amount of organic growth at PSXP and as that business grows, hopefully we get more of that spending gap at that level which really accretive for the partnership.","Evan Calio","Thanks, guys. I\u2019ll leave it there, thank you.","Tim Taylor","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Good afternoon guys and again Greg let me add my congratulations. But I do think I am the only analyst - Kevin congrats on flying the flight to the homeland. I got a couple of questions if I may. So, Greg just going back to Paul earlier question about MLPs. So the multiple compression we\u2019re seeing on the MLP market I think you said in the past that your investments really need about a seven to eight times, CapEx is about maybe seven plus times - back typically, so you need a higher multiple in that to really get the line of sight on the dropdowns. Do you think you can still achieve that in this market or does it may be slow the pace a little bit until things improve?","Greg Maxwell","No. There's a reason for us to slowdown. I mean we look at the yields where we\u2019re trading today, we feel very comfortable Doug.","Doug Leggate","Okay, all right, so no change in strategy. I guess the kind of related question is really is I wanted to revisit something you said when the Company was separated from Conoco to begin with. And that was that you really had no interest in expanding our building out and you wanted to diversify but you clearly doing great. But refining has been very strong I\u2019m just curious if strategically your views have changed any of if you still very much on the opinion of taking a windfall and moving into these other business?","Greg Maxwell","I think there is some great deals that have been done out there by some of our peers. And so for the right opportunity we would never say never, I would reiterate we look at the portfolio investments that we have both in midstream and chemicals. And we still think there's value and preferentially investing in those higher valued higher returning businesses over the refining business.","And so we\u2019ll continue to watch that but there is nothing on the horizon today that we look and say we can increment a lot of value for shareholders by doing that in the refining space.","Doug Leggate","Okay, and then I can squeeze in last one actually more of housekeeping issue - you want to take this but the capture rate in the Mid Continent clearly very, very strong this quarter. I am just wondering if you can point to anything in particular that was behind? And I will leave it there. Thank you.","Tim Taylor","Okay, thanks. Doug, it\u2019s Tim, really it just reflected our ability to place products in the high valued markets in the Mid Cont. So we were able to capture a significant uplift versus the group three averages that we used as a benchmark.","Greg Garland","We see a little bit as well.","Greg Maxwell","Yes, and we had heavy disk that helped us, yes they were up five bucks, so that was helpful to and ran pretty good.","Doug Leggate","Thanks everyone.","Greg Garland","Thanks.","Greg Maxwell","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Dietert with Simmons.","Jeff Dietert","Good morning.","Greg Maxwell","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Dietert","It looks like with some the most recent capital spending plan, we are going to have the second year of declines in capital spending on the upstream side for the first time since the 80s, U.S. production declined for the fifth month in a row in BOE stats today at Gulf of Mexico and Canadian production continue to grow. Could you talk a little bit about how this evolving market is impacting your crude procurement strategy and maybe talk a little bit about how you see differentials playing out going forward?","Tim Taylor","Hey Jeff, it\u2019s Tim. So I\u2019d say that we look at this and say this is a great time for options on crude so the infrastructure projects that we talked about that trade options around our refined network have a great deal of value and obviously we can balance the import versus the inland production and the heavy light.","So I just think we are into a period with that optionality is going to be a key value contributor and that\u2019s where some of our mid-stream spending is going as well to really support that drive commercial value. And Value Bridge is a perfect example where we connect the Texas side to Louisiana to offer more crude options with the terminal that can import and export so just a lot of dynamics, but that\u2019s the kind of things that we are going to capture that.","On this side I think the light heavy dip is likely to stay to a point where that's an attractive options, we think about it. I think the call on lights in the U.S. refining system like crude has increased and its production falls over that\u2019s going to continue to keep that relatively snug. So I think that this will be volatile as you work in the U.S., as you work through both the import and inland production, but I think it speaks to probably a bit narrower WTI-Brent as that shakes up a clearly a period where I think it\u2019s going to move a lot from a month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. So that\u2019s kind of thesis that we are seeing and I think if you look at the market there you see that playing out right now.","Jeff Dietert","Secondly, if I could you mentioned the product exports were down quarter-on-quarter, because of the stronger domestic demand. Are there any specifics you can share with regard to what you're seeing on the demand side, is it due to any specific actions on your part to access additional markets?","Tim Taylor","Well, I think again it goes similar to the crude story, we\u2019ve a lot of options on the placement side with our pipeline network and marine options in the U.S. and so we literally try to optimize a net back around each location that we have and so we were able to access some of those higher valued options as we\u2019ve looked around the system to do that. That said I think exports will remain an important dimension to keep high utilization rates in the U.S.","Jeff Dietert","Congratulations Greg and Kevin. Thanks for your comments.","Greg Garland","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta","Good morning.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Neil Mehta","Or good afternoon. So Greg congratulations on the announcement, Kevin congratulations on the new opportunity. So on the quarter the retail segment really stood out here really outstanding in terms of volume capturing and margins. How sustainable do we think this is and anything idiosyncratic that you think you should carry forward here in terms of what's happening on the marketing in the specialties business I should say?","Tim Taylor","Most of that increases - it\u2019s Tim. Most of the increases is really on the marketing side of our business I would call the wholesale side, obviously it\u2019s a phase to our markers to the retail side, so strong demand has really translated into some opportunity to put better margin there. And then in a period when you have falling prices you're able to capture more of that market, because rack prices tend to lag at the stock price. So there is an element as price movements occur that you can go plus, minus on that, but then structurally the stronger demand picture helps that pricing as well.","Neil Mehta","Thank you. And then on the chemical side, is there an opportunity here to take on incremental leverage at CPChem and use that as a dividend up to the parent?","Tim Taylor","Well, we certainly took that opportunity this last year we put $1.4 billion debt against CPChem. That\u2019s a decision we take between ourselves and our partner in that, but certainly there is more capacity at CPChem if the owners decided that best warranted.","Neil Mehta","All right guys, congrats again.","Greg Garland","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd","Great. Thanks and I'll join in congratulating Greg and Kevin as well. Maybe just a couple of quick housekeeping type ones. Turnaround outlook you had great 3Q run 4Q looks good. Any thoughts in terms of kind of the first half of 2016 what you look like the turnaround point of view I guess both PSX specific and maybe the industry as well?","Greg Garland","Yes, I would say next year 2016 we go back to more normal type turnaround. This is 2015 was abnormal for us. We had a lot of turnarounds going on this year. This is the way schedule hit, but yes, more of a historical turnaround year in terms of expense.","Ryan Todd","Okay thanks and then maybe just one last one I guess you addressed earlier the potential to deploy or questions around deploying additional capital and refining versus other businesses but if you think about the portfolio as well there was recent out there I guess on the like refinery. On the flip side when you look across your refining portfolio is there any - is there the possibility of further rationalizations across the business or you pretty content with the portfolio look likes right now?","Greg Garland","Well, I don\u2019t think our view around portfolio have changed over what we've been saying so you know we always said the Whitegate is probably an asset that we will do something with ultimately. Interesting enough Atlantic basin margins very strong this year and Whitegates has actually been performing quite well in this environment.","But longer-term it\u2019s a relatively small refinery and what we think is the challenge market we continue to think of the California has been [indiscernible] just one of those things that you know long-term we think California is a difficult market we think that certainly our assets our average in that marketplace, but it costs us nothing to hold the option there and will continue to do that we are pleased with the performance of those assets, this year in 2015. So you know you think around the portfolio we\u2019ve done most of the heavy work around the refining portfolio at this point time I would say.","Ryan Todd","Great thanks gentlemen.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Gresham with JPMorgan.","Phil Gresham","Hi, Greg.","Greg Garland","Hi, Phil.","Phil Gresham","First question on CPChem with the projects, is that wiggle room to coming under budget at this stage you think on the first cracker and when - if and when you do second cracker. When you trying to make a decision by?","Greg Garland","Let Tim take that one.","Tim Taylor","I think Phil our view is that we\u2019re still looking at the cost we talked about in those crackers. We are not seeing any kind of extraordinary inflation rate thing, but we are about over 50% complete on that and so we still have some room to go. So our view is it still going to hit about what we expect with over $6 billion investment startup in mid-2017, still like the project. As far as the second cracker goes, we\u2019re still doing development work. So it\u2019s kind of things like site selection, derivatives play, those kind of things continue to advance that.","And I could think about it when you look at it today, these were typically six, seven year project cycle. So that would say FID but you still some period out in the future. But overall it would be look push 2020, 2021 at the earliest and we have flexibility in the timing. But we still like North America, as we think about the NGL supply, we still like the North American side is one of those options. But I will also tell you that we continue to look at cracker sites around the world and we plan to continue to try and not try - we plan to continue to growth that business to match the market growth that we are seeing.","Phil Gresham","Okay. One question for Greg on cash balances. I think in the past you\u2019ve talked about like a minimum cash balance in that $2 billion to $3 billion range. I just wondering with a lower oil prices etc. cetera, if that cash balance that minimum cash balance requirements has change it off. And then I\u2019ll make sure to ask Kevin next time.","Greg Maxwell","Okay, this is Greg. As we looked at we initially when we came out of the spend, we said some neighborhood of $2 billion to $3 billion as we continue to work with our capital structure. I think we could probably easily stay within the $1.5 billion range as long as we have access to the commercial paper markets and use our revolvers as the backstops.","As we\u2019ve continue to sort of get our feelings after the spend and everything. I would say $1.5 billion is probably a decent number to look at.","Tim Taylor","Nice target you leave for Kevin.","Phil Gresham","I just going to ask one last question on the $400 million to $500 million EBITDA guidance target for the two midstream projects, what kind of timeframe do you think you'd be able to achieve that, given that there is a market element to that EBITDA, I mean do you feel confident that you did a full run rate in 2017 or just generally how you are thinking about that?","Tim Taylor","Yes, so in 2016 we\u2019ll start you know we\u2019ll have the frac that's a fee-based asset with supplies taking care of the output is placed with that one. On the LPG export terminal that starts up at the end of 2016. So we would expect over toward mid 2017 or so that we should hit that run rate EBITDA with the variable being really the commercial risk contribution piece that's got some variability but a large piece of that is fee-based as well.","So it\u2019s a 150,000 barrel a day just a reminder, 150,000 barrel a day of LPG export.","Phil Gresham","And would you say the commercial piece of that will be somewhere 100 to 200 range?","Tim Taylor","Yes, I think that\u2019s a decent kind of number to think about that on the risk side.","Phil Gresham","Okay, perfect. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And the next question is from Brad Heffern with RBC.","Brad Heffern","Good morning, everyone.","Tim Taylor","Hi, Brad.","Brad Heffern","I guess to it\u2019s a beat the dead horse a little bit more on midstream obviously you said that the dropdown schedule is still in tax no real change to the - how you are thinking about that? Has there been a change in terms of how you think about the funding side of it? Is one of the levers that you might pull funding it more internally taking PSXP shares back, may be doing internal financing rather than PSXP raising capital on its own in order to finance this dropdown?","Tim Taylor","We don't think that the PSXP\u2019s access to the equity capital markets are going to be impaired. So I think our plan going forward is still kind of half debt, half equity at PSXP to fund it.","Brad Heffern","Okay, great. And then earlier you mentioned that frac one at $1 billion was too big for PSXP to tackle. I am curious on frac two given that a lot of spending is pretty far out. Is that something that PSXP could take on organically rather than being incubated at PSX?","Tim Taylor","No, probably not, we will do that one up top and drop it.","Brad Heffern","Okay, thanks.","Greg Maxwell","Take care.","Operator","And your next question comes from Faisal Khan with Citigroup.","Faisal Khan","Hi good morning or good afternoon, it\u2019s Faisal.","Greg Maxwell","Hey.","Faisal Khan","Greg, congratulations on your retirement, our team here certainly appreciates your insights into the business since the company was spun off. Few questions, just on your prepared remarks you talked about how the Western - the refining complex on the West sort of underperformed because of an outage on the pipeline. And can you elaborate a little bit more on that, because obviously gasoline margins were high sequentially quarter-over-quarter and it seems like maybe there was something on the crude side that I didn't quite get in the prepared remarks?","Greg Garland","Meanwhile to answer your question is probably about 20 a day of crude that we just couldn\u2019t into the facility to run and that probably translates to about $20 million, $22 million or something in that range. And of course we try to do the work around, but the ultimate solutions for the pipe to get back in service so that we can get the right kind of crude in the Santa Maria, but I think that was the biggest impact that we saw in terms of our West Coast operations.","Faisal Khan","Okay, got it. And just going back to marketing just want to understand the strong performance of marketing a little bit too. I believe you guys have some excess capacity on Keystone within that business and then there's the exports of course and then a retro also this issue in the Rhine River had any impact on or sort of benefit in the quarter for marketing margins?","Greg Garland","Really the Keystone is part of our refining earnings in terms of any excess space we have and the ability to capture additional value from that standpoint so it\u2019s not really the sale of clean products. That\u2019s a crude system that we put into really the refining piece of the business and I did not see anything unusual from our perspective with the Rhine and accept to say that European fuel margins were better than the New York harbor. So to the extent that have an impact that may have been the only place where I\u2019d see the uplift from that.","Faisal Khan","Okay. And then on the midstream capital spending I appreciate the details on 2016, if I look at a lot of those projects a lot of your assets come online sort of during the course of next year. And so I just want to go back to the remark you made that you still think you\u2019ll spend kind of $2 billion even beyond that a year at midstream. I\u2019m just trying to understand where that will come from is that going to be value bridge or is there something that will be above and beyond the assets you have online in 2016?","Greg Garland","Yes, I mean we plan the FID Frac Two in 2016 and of course the LPG export terminals start rolling off and one kind of rolls off this year. Than we were not quite a bit worried, and you\u2019ve got to finish up dapple, at topline we\u2019ve got the value bridge that we are looking at which will be funded at PSXP partners of course now after today, but there's is actually quite a bit of other projects we have around Beaumont in terms of access both crude side and product side that we are working that we\u2019ll hear more about in 2016. Tim if you want to add anything on that.","Tim Taylor","No, there is just a host of projects has put infrastructure around our network as well that are just much smaller, so there is a large once there that are coming on and then as we continue to go there is a nice steady stream of smaller incremental projects that are good returns that increase both fee based nature in the midstream and then we capture commercial value in our refining and marketing business.","Faisal Khan","Okay, got you. And one last question from me, you talked about the deferred maintenance during the quarter. When would you see sort of heavy maintenance schedule over the next several months, is that going to be sort of into the first quarter or are we going to see that here in the fourth quarter?","Greg Garland","I think you\u2019ll see seasonally still be in the first quarter, fourth quarter and maybe to reiterate on deferral. What we found is we\u2019ve got much better catalyst performance this year than what we anticipated, it wouldn\u2019t allow us to run that longer before we need to come down to change out that catalyst and that\u2019s just makes good economic sense, it\u2019s not around reliability or other issues in terms of some of the deferrals that we\u2019ve had from 2015 into 2016.","Faisal Khan","Okay, got it. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","That was our last question at this time. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to the presenters.","Greg Garland","Thank you very much for participating in the call today. We do appreciate your interest in the company. You\u2019ll be able to find a transcript of the call posted on our website shortly and if have any additional questions please free to contact Kevin or CW. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell, Vice President, Investor Relations. Kevin, you may begin.","Kevin Mitchell","Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon and welcome to the Phillips 66 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Chairman and CEO, Greg Garland; President, Tim Taylor; EVP and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Maxwell; and EVP, Clayton Reasor.","The presentation material we\u2019ll be using during the call can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website along with supplemental, financial and operating information.","Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from today\u2019s comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here on the second page as well as in our filings with the SEC.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg Garland for some opening remarks.","Greg Garland","Thanks, Kevin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We had a good quarter. Adjusted earnings were $834 million or $1.51 per share. Our West Coast refining business ran well and benefited from the significant improvement in cracks. However, on the Gulf Coast, we did not perform to the level of our expectations. We didn\u2019t execute the lines refinery turnaround as planned and extended downtime prevented us from capturing the full value of improved margins on the U.S. Gulf Coast.","On a positive note, our workers at Alliance achieved the safety milestone of 15 million man hours without a lost-time injury. This is terrific.","During the quarter, cash from operations was $1.4 billion. In addition, we received proceeds of $1.5 billion from Phillips 66 Partners\u2019 debt issuance and first follow-on equity offering. We invested $1.1 billion and supported midstream growth while maintaining operating integrity in our refining system.","Consistent with our commitment to capital allocation, we returned $671 million of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Since we started our share repurchase program, we\u2019ve completed $5.3 billion of the $7 billion authorized.","At quarter end, our share count was 542 million. Our midstream growth projects continue to be well-executed. Sweeny Fractionator One is now over 70% complete. And the Freeport LPG export terminal is about a third done. Both projects are on schedule and on budget with startups expected in the second half of 2015 and 2016 respectively.","We continue to aggressively grow Phillips 66 Partners. In March, we completed a dropdown of our third interest in the Sand Hills and Southern Hills NGL pipelines, as well as our 19.5% interest in Explorer refined products pipeline system. These assets provide portfolio disbursification [ph] as well as additional fee-based revenues to PSXP.","As we said, Partners is an important vehicle to grow our midstream business. Over the last five quarters, PSXP has executed over $2 billion in acquisitions, demonstrating continuing commitment to its top tier distributions growth. PSXP\u2019s goal is a 30% compounding distribution growth rate through 2018.","In chemicals, CPChem\u2019s normal alpha olefins expansion project at its Cedar Bayou facility is on schedule for completion in mid-2015. Also, construction continues on a world-scale U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project which is now about 40% complete with the startup in mid-2017. We expect both projects to come in on budget.","DCP continues to be an important part of our NGL value chain. As one of the nation\u2019s largest natural gas gatherers and processors, over 10% of domestic natural gas flows through DCP Midstream assets. It\u2019s a must run business.","To derive short term liquidity needs, DCP Midstream achieved current [ph] relief on its bank revolver until year end 2015. DCP has also implemented steps to reduce corporate costs in its capital budget.","Spectra Energy and Phillips 66 continue to progress the restructuring of the business. And we anticipate that we\u2019ll be able to share more details with you in the coming months.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg Maxwell to review the quarter\u2019s results.","Greg Maxwell","Thanks, Greg. Good afternoon. Starting on Slide 4, our first quarter earnings on adjusted basis were $834 million or $1.51 per share. Cash from operations was $1.4 billion, including $500 million in positive working capital changes for the quarter. In addition, Phillips 66 Partners debt and equity offerings provided $1.5 billion of cash this quarter. We reinvested $1.1 billion in the business and we returned almost $700 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","At the end of the first quarter, our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio, which excludes Phillips 66 Partners, was 26%. And after taking into consideration our ending cash balance, the adjusted net debt-to-capital ratio was 11%. Our annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 12%. And excluding special items, the adjusted effective income tax rate for the quarter was 34%.","Slide 5 compares first quarter adjusted earnings with the fourth quarter on a segment basis. Overall, quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were down $79 million with increased earnings from refining being more than offset by reduced earnings in our other segments. I\u2019ll cover each of these segments in more detail as we move forward.","Starting with midstream, the transportation business continues to be a source of stable earnings. DCP is aggressively addressing the challenges associated with the lower commodity price environment. And as Greg said, the NGL Fractionator project is on track and is over 70% complete.","Annualized 2015 year-to-date adjusted return on capital employed for this segment was 6% based on an average capital employed of $5.3 billion. The returns for this segment reflect the impact of lower NGL prices as well as increases in capital employed from the significant investments we\u2019re making in midstream that are still under construction and not yet producing returns.","Moving on to the next slide. Midstream\u2019s first quarter adjusted earnings were $67 million, down $30 million from the fourth quarter. Transportation earnings for the quarter were $65 million. The overall increase of $12 million compared with the prior quarter is largely due to the writeoff of a deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter.","DCP Midstream had losses in the first quarter that were comparable with what we saw in the fourth quarter. NGL and crude prices were lower in the quarter but this impact was mostly offset by the lack of hedging losses experienced in the fourth quarter. And our NGL business had lower earnings mainly due to seasonal propane and butane storage related benefits in the fourth quarter as well as inventory impacts.","Included in the transportation and the NGL results is the contribution from Phillips 66 Partners. During the quarter, PSXP contributed earnings of $19 million to the midstream segment.","Moving on to Slide 8. In chemicals, the global olefins and polyolefins capacity utilization rate for the quarter was 87%. This reflected a full quarter of operations in Port Arthur, partially offset by turnaround activities in Cedar Bayou and the CPChem joint venture facility in Qatar.","Results for both O&P and SA&S were impacted by lower margins. The 2015 annualized year-to-date adjusted return on capital employed for our chemicals segment was 16% and this is based on an average capital employed of $5 billion.","As shown on Slide 9, first quarter adjusted earnings for chemicals were $203 million, down from $270 million. In olefins and polyolefins, the decrease of $65 million is largely due to lower olefins to polyethylene cash chain margins for U.S. and international operations along with turnaround activities. Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics earnings were in line with the prior quarter with lower margins being partially offset by reduced cost.","Moving on to refining. Realized margins improved this quarter to $12.26 per barrel, largely driven by strong market conditions in the West and Gulf Coasts. Refining crude utilization and clean product yields were both at 84% during the quarter. Annualized 2015 year-to-date adjusted return on capital employed for refining was 15% on average capital employed of $13.5 billion.","Moving to the next slide. The refining segment had adjusted earnings of $495 million. This is up $173 million from last quarter.","Before I dive into the regions, I wanted to point out a change in reporting from previous quarters. We have realigned our refining business to move results that were previously included in other refining into their respective regions. Along with this change, we have recast 2014 quarterly information as well and this can be found in the supplemental pages to the earnings release.","Overall, the improvement this quarter was due to higher realized refining margins, including the benefit of lower crude cost on secondary products, partially offset by lower volumes.","Regionally, the Atlantic Basin had lower earnings mainly due to plant maintenance at the Bayway refinery and foreign exchange losses of about $30 million due to a strengthening U.S. dollar.","The Gulf Coast was up from last quarter, reflecting higher crack spreads and improved secondary product margins in the region. Reduced volumes from a downtime at the Alliance refinery partially offset this increase.","The Central Corridor was flat compared to last quarter as improvements in secondary products were mostly offset by lower volumes due to plant turnarounds at the Ponca City and border refineries.","Western Pacific had the largest improvement driven mainly from significantly higher gasoline cracks. First quarter gasoline cracks for the Western Pacific region were $20.21 per barrel compared with $7.46 last quarter, resulting in record earnings for the region.","Let\u2019s move to the next slide on market capture.","Our worldwide realized margin was $12.26 per barrel versus the 321 market crack of $15.26, resulting in an overall market capture of 80%. The overall configuration to produce roughly equal amounts of diesel and gasoline reduced our realized margin as the improved market crack this quarter was largely driven by the strength in gasoline.","Improvements from the feedstock advantage more than offset secondary product losses which were significantly lower in this crude price environment. The other category mainly includes cost associated with rents, product differentials and inventory impacts.","A regional view of our market capture is available in the appendix.","Moving on to marketing and specialties. Annualized 2015 year-to-date adjusted return on capital employed for M&S was 28% on average capital employed of $2.8 billion. Slide 14 shows adjusted earnings for M&S in the first quarter of $194 million, down from the high levels we saw in the fourth quarter.","In marketing and other, the $112 million decrease was largely due to lower global marketing margins this quarter compared to strong margins that we realized last quarter.","The fourth quarter benefited from the timing effects of steeply falling gasoline and diesel spot prices. The decrease in specialties was primarily related to our lubricants business where lower base low margins were partially offset by increased volumes.","Moving on to corporate and other. This segment had after tax cost of $125 million this quarter, a $25 million increase over last quarter mainly due to higher interest expense and lower foreign tax credits. The corporate overhead bar includes restructuring costs that were taken during the quarter.","Next, I\u2019ll talk about our capital structure.","With the additional debt and equity financing that Phillips 66 Partners took on for its recent acquisition, we thought it would be helpful to show our capital structure both on a consolidated basis and excluding PSXP.","As shown on the chart on the right, our debt balance was reduced in the first quarter largely due to the repayment of $800 million of senior notes that matured in March. Excluding Partners, we ended the quarter with an adjusted debt balance of $7.8 billion, an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of 26% and a net debt to capital ratio of 11%.","The next slide shows our cash flow during the quarter.","Starting on the left, excluding working capital, cash from operations was $900 million. Working capital changes were a positive impact of $500 million due largely to a benefit from timing of foreign excise taxes and a U.S. tax refund associated with late 2014 regulation changes.","During the quarter, we added $1.5 billion of cash from PSXP\u2019s debt and equity issuances. We also repaid $800 million of maturing notes. We funded $1.1 billion of capital expenditures in investments and distributed about $700 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5.4 billion.","This concludes my discussion of the financial and operational results. I\u2019ll now cover a few outlook items.","For the second quarter, in chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the low 90s. In refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to also be in the low 90s and pre-tax turnaround expense to be about $150 million.","In corporate and other, we expect this segment\u2019s after-tax cost to run about $110 million to $120 million for the second quarter. And company-wide, the effective income tax rate is expected to be in the mid-30s. As for 2015 capital expenditures, our original $4.6 billion guidance remains unchanged.","With that, we\u2019ll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. The line is open.","Evan Calio","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","Greg Garland","Good afternoon.","Evan Calio","I look forward to the update on the DCP restructuring and I appreciate if you don\u2019t have any comments, but I\u2019m wondering if you could share generally what PSX wants to achieve in the restructuring and your willingness to take commodity exposure in the structure beyond DCP\u2019s exposure.","Greg Garland","So, Evan, just kind of reiterate what we\u2019ve previously said maybe about DCP, it\u2019s a great asset. We think that we like their positions in the value chain. We like the areas where they compete. And so we view it as a strong asset. Unquestionably, the lower commodity prices put some stress on that. And so we\u2019re working to correct that.","What I would say is I think that both Spectra Energy and ourselves are in agreement on the path forward and that we\u2019re executing that. And we don\u2019t want to get out in front of the activities that are ongoing.","So I would just say we\u2019re in process. We\u2019re not at the beginning, but we\u2019re also not at the end of that process. So we\u2019re working through it.","Evan Calio","Great. That\u2019s fair. My second question is on refining. And the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of 2015 witnessed a heavy Gulf Coast turnaround. So I mean, are you largely complete for the year? And any color - exiting that heavy turnaround period we should expect any kind of capture uplift or otherwise enhancement?","Greg Garland","So I mean, we\u2019ve guided that 2015 is going to be a heavier turnaround year than 2014. I mean, normally, we\u2019re kind of $400 million-ish on turnarounds. I think we\u2019ve guided $650 million or so this year. And Greg just gave guidance for $150 million turnaround expense in the second quarter.","So it\u2019s going to be a heavy year for us all the way through in turnarounds. I don\u2019t know if anyone else has any color on that but - okay.","Evan Calio","And any capture uplift exiting on the back of that? Is it just standard maintenance or is there any kind of enhancement exiting a heavy maintenance period that the system might emerge more flexible, profitable?","Greg Garland","Well, so this is mostly maintenance turnarounds but there are activities going on where we\u2019re doing some debottlenecks to push more lightweight [ph] crude. We\u2019ve done it at Alliance, we\u2019ve done it at Sweeny. And we\u2019ll continue to work our way through the system at Bayway and other places to be able to handle those lighter barrels.","And we\u2019re probably up $100,000 today, over what we were say two years ago in terms of our ability to handle lightweight [ph] crude across the system today. So we\u2019ll continue to do that. But this, by and large, the bulk of the activity is more just routine maintenance.","Evan Calio","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next we have Jeff Dietert with Simmons on the line. Your line is open.","Jeff Dietert","Good afternoon.","Greg Garland","Hey, Jeff.","Jeff Dietert","Hey. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about Gulf Coast crudes. We\u2019re seeing LLS has been trading close to parity with Brent and Houston pricing has been depressed relative to St. James and now Cushing is weak and perhaps pushing more barrels south on market MarketLink and Seaway. Could you talk about how that market\u2019s evolving and how it\u2019s influencing your Gulf Coast feedstock procurement?","Tim Taylor","Hey, Jeff, it\u2019s Tim. Yes, I think that structurally LLS Louisiana remains tight logistically. And so I think that when you think about logistics out of, say, Texas and Louisiana pipe or ship, we\u2019ve got a lot of constraint there. So I think that supports that differential couple of dollars.","And then ultimately, there is the import option. And so I think that that presents kind of a cap on the LLS in terms of [ph] working separate. But that said, you would - if you can\u2019t get those lighter curds in Louisiana for competition, it will so that that issue will continue to keep Texas discounted and Cushing discounted relative to Cushing.","And ultimately, we\u2019re working the solutions to look at how do we logistically get more of those crude options into Louisiana. We\u2019ve talked about a pipeline out of Beaumont into Louisiana that we\u2019re working and some other things. So I think that those take more time but it is part of what we work on.","Jeff Dietert","Are you seeing Cushing barrels being priced more attractively into the Gulf Coast market, be it heavy or light?","Tim Taylor","I think you looked at the breakover in inventory this month. And our view was that at some point, if the crude production of light continues, it\u2019s got to move to the Gulf Coast for storage. And so I think you\u2019ve seen some of that. You\u2019ve also got more connection out of West Texas to grip [ph] into the Gulf Coast. And all those things impact that.","But given the storage situation at Cushing, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s surprising that you\u2019ve seen movement now out of that region. The real input is going to be how much crude production continues to flow out of the Permian and the Midcon into the system.","Jeff Dietert","And secondly, could you provide opportunity cost associated with first corridor maintenance?","Greg Garland","It was about 8% of production was maintenance, about 6% was unplanned downtime and about 2% was planned downtime. So I mean normally what we do is we would take that and multiply it by the margins as they lay. So for instance, we think our end plan [ph] downtime is in the neighborhood of about $80 million across the system","Jeff Dietert","All right. Thanks for your comments.","Operator","Next we have Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate","Thanks, guys. I\u2019m not going to push the DCP issue too much but I just wondered if you would respond to one issue. There\u2019s been some, I guess, speculation that PSX might be prepared to inject capital but without the need to consolidate DCP and without Spectra contributing any capital. Would you care to comment on that or would you prefer just to leave it alone for now?","Greg Garland","Yes, I\u2019d let that one lay for right now, Doug.","Doug Leggate","All right. I thought I\u2019d try, sorry about that. Just to have a quick run [ph] because I figured that may be a quick answer. Could exports, Greg, not your opinion so much on good exports, but your opinion on what it could mean for the MLP in terms of opportunities if indeed we did see a relaxing of that rule. Are you exploring any opportunities on those lines at this point? And I\u2019ve got one final follow-up, please.","Greg Garland","I think in terms of optionality, that\u2019s one of the things we liked about Beaumont that it certainly gave us a footprint and one that we can certainly expand in terms of optionality around crude exports with MLP. So I think that that\u2019s a potential we certainly think about.","I still don\u2019t see short term lifting of the ban on crude exports. We\u2019ll see. I mean, it\u2019s a political decision, as everyone knows. And certainly the volume is being turned up in many quarters around exports. And we continue to support lifting the ban on crude exports as a company. We think it\u2019s the right thing to do.","We\u2019d like to see a broader conversation around energy in our country to include being able to build pipelines and a conversation around Jones Act ships so that we can effectively not be outcompeted by moving crude around from the Gulf Coast to East Coast refineries. But at the end of the day, I think we have some optionality in our portfolio that would play well under the act if that happens.","Doug Leggate","Thanks, Greg. My last one is a little cheeky, really. It\u2019s a bit more conceptual but I guess I\u2019m kind of asking you to do our job for us to some extent. When we were on the road, we had this discussion, I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on it. The value of your GP in the midstream and I guess in the MLP units as well, how do you think about getting recognition of the GP in particular in your stock?","And internally, do you think about your ownership on both those species [ph] on a pre-tax or a post-tax basis? Do you think the market should be pre-tax or post-tax? I\u2019m just trying to kind of resolve an issue we\u2019re trying to get to the bottom of here.","Greg Garland","So we\u2019re doing some of the parts, guys, here, so we always think in terms of some of the parts as we\u2019re doing analysis around the asset, around the portfolio. I think this point the GP cash flows are so small they don\u2019t matter at this point in time. When we get to $1 billion of EBITDA in PSXP, then I think it does matter.","And so we\u2019ll see. I think that we\u2019re prepared to consider many options around how do you get that recognized out there. But today, it\u2019s small but growing. And in terms of the - I mean, we had a conversation around pre-tax. I think the multiples are kind of on a pre-tax basis as people look at it. But does that change overtime?","I just don\u2019t know the answer to that. I don\u2019t know, Tim or Greg, do you have a view on that?","Tim Taylor","I think the market comps are pre-tax. And I think that\u2019s the relevant measure when you think about other GPs or you think about the LPs. It\u2019s a pre-tax basis and I think that\u2019s the fair way to look at that.","Doug Leggate","I guess where I\u2019m getting at, Tim, is when we think about how that should translate to the PSX share price on a pre-tax or post-tax basis.","Tim Taylor","I think we think about it in terms of the EB. And EBITDA multiple and as you value those streams and that translates into that EB and that\u2019s how we think about some of the parts basis. So it really is on a pre-tax basis when we think about that uplift, yes.","Greg Maxwell","Doug, this is Greg Maxwell. We did have that discussion while we were on the road. And I will say it\u2019s an interesting discussion. We\u2019re continuing to look at it. So obviously we\u2019d like to have some ongoing dialog with you as we work through this.","Doug Leggate","Perfect. I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank is on the line. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks a lot. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Maybe if I could start with maybe a two-part question on CapEx and cash return to shareholders. If we look at - we know that this is a peak CapEx year in 2015. How should we think about the potential decline in CapEx year-on-year into 2016?","And maybe as a follow-up with that and looking at the amount of buyback in the quarter, you\u2019ve targeted a 60-40 split between capital spend and cash return to shareholders over a multiyear period. Should we expect to hold that same split here in 2015 or do you think that will be a little bit lighter on the cash return this year and heavier on the cash return next year?","Greg Garland","Okay. So let\u2019s start with CapEx. And I think we\u2019ve consistently said we view that this is the heavy lift year for us, peak year. We\u2019re still working through \u201916 budgets and obviously need to go through our board approval process. But we\u2019re thinking the range is in $3 billion to $4 billion for \u201916 in terms of capital.","And the 60-40 allocation, we remain committed to. And that\u2019s an average of the essentially the \u201914, \u201915, \u201916 timeframe if you want to think about it that way. What I would say is in any one quarter, you shouldn\u2019t look at that quarter and expect that you can annualize that across the year.","On the other hand, if you think about $4.6 billion of capital expense, you think about $1.1 billion or so dividend expenses here, then you can take your pick on cash. But you also have to roll into that equation the drops and the cash we get back from the drops and the PSXP as part of the funding vehicle, then you can kind of back into - share repurchase can be in the range of $1 billion to $2 billion this year.","Ryan Todd","Great. Maybe if I could just do one quick follow-up on the chems business, fees in the first quarter clearly are going to be better this year than I think what the fees were as we approach the latter part of last year. But can you give us an outlook at this point in terms of kind of a chemicals outlook for the rest of the year in particular as crude prices are going to be ticking up a little bit?","Greg Garland","Sure. Yes. I\u2019ll let Tim take a stab at that.","Tim Taylor","Yes, sure. I think that in the first quarter, we saw the readjustment, the lower energy complex and the margins have come in. Particularly in the olefins chain, if they\u2019ve stabilized, you think about the pricing in terms of the feedstocks and the margin. And we\u2019re seeing increased demand. As the energy prices come up, I think it\u2019s actually encouraged people to begin their buying.","So we\u2019re seeing demand up really across the world, so Asia, Europe, U.S. and I think that supports that margin. So I think we still remain convinced that the chemicals business is going to continue to perform well. Margin is still less than \u201914 based on the current crude price outlook but still a pretty business model from a fundamental demand standpoint.","Ryan Todd","Great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.","Tim Taylor","Thank you.","Operator","Paul Cheng with Barclays is on the line. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng","Hey, guys.","Greg Garland","Hey, Paul.","Paul Cheng","Hopefully [ph], just have a quick question. Greg, do you guys have a outlook you can share in terms of the CapEx for 2016, 2017? I think at one point you guys talking about this year is the peak and you moved towards the three pinning [ph] tie up mark. Is it to be assumed that next year you will get all the way to three or that it will take a couple of years before you get down there?","Greg Garland","Well, I think yes, I think we\u2019re looking at somewhere between $3 billion and $4 billion for 2016, Paul. Obviously, we need to get that through that board and get that approved. And we\u2019re still thinking about it. But it\u2019s definitely going to be down from the $4.6 billion level this year, and in that range of $3 billion to $4 billion next year.","Paul Cheng","And should we assume that after next year that it will - really on a more sustainable basis you guys would be more in the $3 billion than the $4 billion or that is still unclear at this point?","Greg Garland","Well, I think that we\u2019re going to have a, what I would say, is an aggressive growth profile at PSXP. So as you think about on consolidated basis, most of that capital spend start moving to PSXP. As it gets scale, certainly, it can stand on its own feet. It can coinvest in a lot of these projects, ultimately invest in these projects.","And so you may see consolidated capital up in that level. But that PSX in the level of PSX, we expect that to go down more to a maintenance level type activity.","Paul Cheng","Got it. Secondly, I think in the past, that management view West Coast or California is not necessary a core part of the portfolio long-term. With the market condition that we have seen in the last several months, just curious is there any change in your view about California market? What is their position or growth in your portfolio long-term?","Greg Garland","Well, we might see the West Coast this quarter. But, fundamentally, our long-term view of West Coast hasn\u2019t changed. We think it\u2019s really a challenged place to do business. And we think we have kind of - we have good assets, but we think they\u2019re average you have crossed that portfolio. And so we\u2019ll continue to work the thick strategy around the West Coast as we look at more optionality around getting the advantage crude into those assets so kind of cost structure, et cetera, around those assets.","But I would say, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s changed our fundamental view on West Coast assets today.","Paul Cheng","And on the second quarter, the maintenance, can you give us some idea that with the concentration going to be by region.","Greg Garland","We typically won\u2019t give guidance there.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Not even by region, saying that is maturity in the West Coast [ph] maturity in Gulf Coast, so anything right there?","Greg Garland","No.","Paul Cheng","Okay.","Greg Garland","We probably just don\u2019t want to disadvantage our commercial folks.","Paul Cheng","Sure. I understand. And two final questions on the - I\u2019m trying to hope [ph] that you can give us updates in some of your market insights. In Europe, I think that [indiscernible] surprised by how strong the margin has been. Initially, we thought they\u2019re punching away tide [ph] and subsequently of course, with oil price stabilized that they remain rather strong, I want to see whether you have any insight whether that - is it because the demand maybe perhaps much better or the capacity over there may not be as much as people thought.","And second that in your wholesale network, any insight you can forward in terms of what is the gasoline and the diesel demand growth that we may be actually seeing? It seems to have somewhat different number, depends on who we talk to. So I want to see what is your market system you\u2019re telling us.","Tim Taylor","Paul, it\u2019s Tim. On Europe, I think it is a combination of some turnarounds as I held - looked to the season right now. Clearly, with grant moving down, they were able to capture some margins well.","And then we\u2019re seeing stronger demand out of Middle East, particularly on gasoline and some of West Africa. So I think that\u2019s helped support the demand side from a European standpoint. So I don\u2019t know how long that goes on. But that was certainly the dynamic that we see in place in the first quarter and continuing right now.","On our system on gasoline demand, you\u2019d like to have a number of [indiscernible] but generally across our wholesale and branded marketing network, volumes are up. It varies a lot as you look across the system. But a couple of points on demand seems like where it is. Whether that\u2019s sustainable, I think we need more time. But certainly, it\u2019s been something that supported the gasoline side.","Diesel demand is off from somewhat to flat because of really seasonal planting and perhaps some impacting energy. But still pretty strong market on the diesel side as well. But gasoline is probably been the surprise in the demand side.","Paul Cheng","Yes. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs in on the line with a question. Your line is open.","Neil Mehta","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","Greg Garland","Good afternoon.","Neil Mehta","So there\u2019s a lot of talk about a crude blood [ph] translating to a product blood in the refining markets but then increasing utilization in response to strong margins and spreads we\u2019re seeing out there. Just curious what you\u2019re guys thoughts are on that risk and how you see that as a participant in the market.","Tim Taylor","So product inventories are on, as you know, at the high side of five-year range. We haven\u2019t seen that develop and everything continues to push the run side. You\u2019re entering a strong season now on demand. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that we anticipate. There\u2019s less storage opportunity on the product side. So if it does develop, I think you\u2019d see runs reduced. And then of course we keep an eye on what\u2019s happening globally with the new supply. And as that comes on, that can have an impact as well.","But right now, we just haven\u2019t seen that as at an issue.","Neil Mehta","And the other big macro debate that we\u2019re having, Tim, just a few weeks ago on the last call was the risk that Cushing fills and we finally got that draw earlier this week. But curious on that front, what your thoughts are in terms of accrued storage in Cushing and then in pad 2 and 3 generally, and is there enough takeaway that you\u2019re not concerned about a broader crude problem.","Tim Taylor","Yes. I think that when we look at it, we still think we\u2019re watching the production side. And so I think it still needs to find a place for storage. Cushing is pretty close. And so I think that\u2019s part of that. We look at the Gulf Coast, we\u2019ve got a lot of room on storage. So I think that was where we thought that would go. And so there\u2019s some time I think still left to see where inventory build goes versus the production side on the EMP side.","And then fundamentally what would have to happen next is you might have to push on some medium, imports or some way to drive that displacement. But I think we\u2019re ways off. But certainly, you have seen that move and you\u2019re watching the pad 3 inventory of crude grow. So I think that there is between imports and inputs from the [indiscernible] in particular and Cushing you\u2019re seeing that move.","Neil Mehta","And last question is just around capital allocation. Buy back and dividend, you bought back $400 million in the quarter. So curious how you think about that on a go-forward whether that\u2019s a reasonable run rate to use. And then on the dividend, you\u2019ve talked about double-digit being the growth target in \u201915 and \u201916. Obviously a lot of financial commitments in 2015. But anything you could do to help us benchmark where that dividend growth should be anchored to.","Tim Taylor","Yes. So we stand by the guidance of double-digit dividend growth in \u201915 and \u201916 [indiscernible] purchases. As long as the [indiscernible] intrinsic value, we\u2019re going to be buyers of the shares and we look at that. I would say, don\u2019t take one quarter and say that\u2019s a run rate. We\u2019re in the market every day. We buy more some days than others. But in general, I think we\u2019ve kind of guided you to expect that that would be between $1 billion and $2 billion this year in terms of share repurchase.","Neil Mehta","All right. Very clear. Thanks, guys.","Greg Garland","Thank you.","Operator","We have Blake Fernandez with Howard Wheel on the line with questions. Your line is open.","Blake Fernandez","Thanks, folks. Good afternoon. Greg, maybe just tying on with the last question on the repurchases, not to try and hold you down to too much of an outlook. But you\u2019ve already alluded to CapEx rolling over in the \u201916. Do you think it\u2019s fair to believe that $1 billion to $2 billion of repurchase run rate kind of continues into \u201916 assuming no material changes in macro dynamics?","Greg Garland","Yes. I think that\u2019s probably not bad. We purchased about $2.2 billion in \u201913 and about $2.2 billion in \u201914. And so I think it\u2019s been a pretty consistent number for us if you want to think about it that way.","Blake Fernandez","Okay. Secondly, on CPChem, your partner recently has expressed some willingness to maybe lever up a bit which has been a bit of a pivot from the previous strategy. I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that entity as you move forward pass the spending cycle. Do you kind of envision ongoing growth projects beyond the 2017 timeframe or should we think about moving to a cash harvest phase?","Greg Garland","Go ahead.","Tim Taylor","Yes, Blake, it\u2019s Tim. I think that we anticipate - with like chemicals, we continue to see growth there. And we\u2019re going to participate at. So we\u2019ve talked about a second, for instance, cracker project, sometime past 2020, somewhere in the world with North America and Middle East remain very logical places we think for a light cracker.","And beyond that on the financial side, is I think we - that business will continue to be self-funding. But generally, we would expect surplus cash return back to the owners as well. And the leverage issue is just something that owners would consider. With this big crude, you want to keep the balance sheet very strong there. It\u2019s great shape today. But it is something that we can always think about.","But fundamentally, that\u2019s a strong business in terms of cash generation and ability to fund this growth.","Blake Fernandez","Okay. And the last follow on, just with CPChem, I know it\u2019s 40% complete. And Greg, you mentioned that it was on budget. I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s any potential just given the macro dynamics and supply chain deflation that maybe the cost come in a bit lower than anticipated?","Greg Garland","We\u2019ll see. We\u2019ve got a way to go on that project. On some of our projects that are nearer to completion, for instance, the frac-1 and I think we have a good charter bringing that in under budget. We\u2019ll see as we finish execution on that project.","So I would say that the odds are in our favor of executing well on this environment. And taking some pressure off is a good thing in terms of project execution.","Blake Fernandez","Absolutely. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI is on the line with a question. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson","Good afternoon, everybody.","Greg Garland","Hi, Doug.","Doug Terreson","I have a capital discipline question as well. And specifically, Greg, one of the foundations of the company\u2019s success over the past several years has involved the ability to balance both capital spending and distributions in a way that generated both growth and returns for shareholders at the same time.","And on this point, it seems like with the investment opportunity set as strong as it\u2019s ever been that maintaining capital discipline might become more challenging than it\u2019s ever been too. So my question is, would you agree with the comment about your investment opportunities that [indiscernible] think that you guys just might be in a sweet spot? And if you do, how would you need to manage the capital allocation and then [indiscernible] monitoring process differently in the future. So can you just spend a minute talking about how you\u2019re thinking about this?","Greg Garland","Happy to do that. I think that fundamentally our views on capital allocation have been very consistent since the spend. We see an opportunity to create a lot of economic value for shareholders by growing our MLP faster. And so we\u2019ve had kind of had our foot on the accelerator there. Certainly, we\u2019ve been willing to use our balance sheet, use our cash to incubate projects at Phillips 66, but ultimately our debts [ph] are put in MLP.","What we\u2019ve also said is MLP gets the size and scale. And it grows up so to speak. It should be able to stand on its own two feet and generate value. So I think we\u2019re kind of in this period of time where what I call interim period, where we\u2019re building on behalf of the MLP. But that changes with time I think if you think about that going forward into the future.","But clearly, for us to get to $1.1 billion of EBITDA by 2018 and generate $20 billion of value for our shareholders, we\u2019ve got line of sight on that. We\u2019re clearly focused on executing that well.","Doug Terreson","Great. Thanks a lot.","Greg Garland","Yes.","Operator","You have Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse on the line. Your line is open.","Edward Westlake","Thank you. And a good segue, so - sorry, I think it\u2019s a $3 billion or $4 billion, sorry, on CapEx. But a number of the MLP projects probably have shifted a little bit to the right relative to what you\u2019re thinking, frac-2. I\u2019m sure if you look at what\u2019s going on in the Permian and then in the Oklahoma Basins where obviously DCP has a good footprint once you get past the near-term worries, there are lots of opportunities that are emerging with the success of shales.","So maybe talk a little bit specifically about interest in frac-2 and then perhaps some opportunities if there are any too to accelerate in the MLP again as oil price pick up.","Greg Garland","Yes. So we felt really comfortable with the slide of projects we have with frac-1, LPG export facility. Felt good on both sides of those contract-wise, in terms of executing on those projects. In our original plans before we saw the follow up in crude prices. We probably would have taken frac-2 to FID [ph] late this year and the condensate splitter.","We pushed those at least a year at this point. I think we\u2019ll see what Oakland impact of the reduced capital spend is on the EMP side and where liquids are really going to go. But in our planning, they\u2019re pushed at least a year at this point in time.","But our view is crude going to stay $50 either. And as crude prices come back and you can pick your level of what they go to in \u201916 and \u201917, then I think these projects are going to be necessary to get these liquids to the market center and you\u2019ll see the investment go forward. And Tim, if you want to comment on anything.","Tim Taylor","Yes. I think as we\u2019re seeing that is we\u2019re seeing some opportunities to run the existing framework that weren\u2019t in that plan. So some smaller project execution, the Bayou bridge, east out of bowman [ph] is a possibility.","So we continue to develop other opportunities maybe to move from the market centers into the demand centers. So I think that\u2019s another dimension. So we still feel that there\u2019s good infrastructure growth and that certainly needs to be filled the next several years.","Edward Westlake","On the assets that you have in place which could be used for say Oklahoma, Southern Hills, Texas Express. Are those easy to expand or we are going to be sort of limits and it would have to be greenfield if those place take off?","Greg Garland","No. There is expansion capability in those new NGL pipes built out of Permian, on Sand Hills, as well as the Mid Con. So as the volumes can ramp up, we can do a fairly low cost [indiscernible] to get ramped up in the pipeline. And of course, that creates opportunity to the G&P side for DCT.","Edward Westlake","Right. Okay. And then on DAPL and ETCOP set up roaming around and then down to Vermont and across to Louisiana, have you kind of like got a tariff yet in terms of what that might cost to Bakken crude down into Louisiana refineries via that route?","Tim Taylor","We haven\u2019t published that. So we really can\u2019t speak directly. Our belief is it\u2019s going to be the lowest cost from one of the lowest cap options to get crude from the Bakken into the Gulf Coast.","Edward Westlake","Right. Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research is on the line. Your line is open. Mr. Sankey, please check that you\u2019re not on mute.","Okay. Next, we have Phil Gresham with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Gresham","Hi there. Most of the questions have been asked. But I guess just in terms of the [indiscernible] you talked about pushing a couple of the projects maybe a year. But I guess to the extent that you run with the capital budget you\u2019re talking about for next year, what would that align with from an EBITDA standpoint 2018 or 2017 at this point in terms of kind of comparing your old midstream guidance to what this might imply considering that if I look at your old CapEx is about $4.35 billion plus then you have to add in about $600 million for DPL on that cap I think. So it\u2019s closer to $5 billion.","Tim Taylor","Yes. This is Tim. So we get guidance analyst day of around $7 billion on midstream. I think that number is still pretty good. So I think the EBITDA associated with that, you take the existing EBITDA and you put the MLP, we talked about PSXP being over $1 billion. That still exist with that pool of over $1 billion of droppable EBITDA should we desire to do that.","A lot of that cap are those in those development various stages in development. And then there\u2019s a backlog of projects. So we\u2019re still on target. The absolute timing of that number may move out a year or so based on that. But fundamentally, that still has a great backlog of droppable EBITDA on the projects we have under development.","Phil Gresham","Okay. And then just a follow up on potentially I think back to the CPChem balance sheet, given that it\u2019s self-funding proposition already, if you went down that path, is that something where you would consider incremental, just dividend in your incremental cash back to PSX or is that a bridge you haven\u2019t really have crossed at this point?","Tim Taylor","Well, I think we look at CPChem and you look at the cash generation, you said good solid business, so it gives a flood of options and there\u2019s a lot of capacity there. So it\u2019s possible that it could come back if we did that to the owners.","Greg Garland","Yes. I would just say we\u2019re not opposed to putting debt at CPChem. And if you look historically, we just don\u2019t hold a lot of cash there.","Phil Gresham","Yes. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Brad Heffern with RBC is on the line. Please go ahead.","Brad Heffern","Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. Just a follow up to one of the previous questions. I wonder if you can give your thoughts on the condensate splitter project in the context of likely more condensate exports happening this year are lightly processed condensate exports and what the advantage to maybe having it at a field level versus somewhere else.","Tim Taylor","This is Tim. I guess we continue to look at the process piece and say, with this slowdown, liquids production that we anticipate the EMPs have reduced their spend, we think that pushes that push on that really light condensate perhaps at least a year.","But that said, I think we\u2019ve looked at field and we\u2019re prepared I think to address it from a how do you get it from the yield to a market center or to an export dock, is an opportunity.","I think having a larger frac offers a lot of opportunities and options about where to go with the product and the types of exploring [ph] it to do where you do a deeper cut or just a topping piece.","So exports are an option, filling out other parts of the refining system are an option. So we kind of like that centralized idea from the standpoint that we think it provides more market options ultimately in the system.","Brad Heffern","Okay. That\u2019s great color. And then thinking about the midstream side of things, have there been any more attractive M&A opportunities on the market given the downturn in commodity prices and how do you think about midstream acquisitions, potentially PSXP versus dropdown?","Tim Taylor","I mean we\u2019re looking at that all the time. And what I would say is there appear to be a lot of distressed prices out there right now. We might say we\u2019re a little surprised by that as we think that through but we just don\u2019t see any compelling cases out there today. But we\u2019ll continue to watch that.","Brad Heffern","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We have Faisal Khan from Citigroup on the line. Please go ahead.","Faisal Khan","Yes, good afternoon. Just one sort of theoretical question on DCT midstream. Were there any sort of tax impact to you, guys, if you were to spin if the joint venture partners decide to spin off entity to their current shareholders? So meaning that PSX and as the [ph] shareholders begin to provide the share DCT to be spun off. I mean I know you guys have both negative tax basis. So I\u2019m just trying to understand if that would solve the tax basis issues over the long run?","Greg Maxwell","Now, Faisal, this is Greg Maxwell. As part of the restructuring that Greg mentioned earlier, we\u2019re looking at all those different ins and outs and the pros and cons of the different restructuring of which includes any tax impact. So it would come about as well as tax planning opportunities.","Faisal Khan","Okay. So it\u2019s not clear yet if a spinoff of the asset would be tax free to you guys or not, is that a fair statement?","Greg Maxwell","I would say we\u2019re still looking at it.","Faisal Khan","Okay, okay. Understood. And then just on the free port LPG export facility, can you guys just give us an update in terms of where you are with construction on that facility and when you expect the first exports?","Tim Taylor","Fai, this is Tim. So we\u2019re progressing. We\u2019re about 35%, 40% complete, gone well during the field constructing. And so we\u2019re actually doing dock modifications, building tanks, putting in the compressors or foundations, still on target to start that up in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Faisal Khan","Okay, got you. And then just going back to the results you guys talked about on the Atlantic side, you guys talked about a daily being down. But you talked about an FX impact. I didn\u2019t quite understand what the FX impact is or why it would show up given that most of what you sell is priced in dollar including fuel and cost around oil. So I just want to understand where the FX impact comes from.","Greg Maxwell","Faisal, this is Greg Maxwell again. One thing to keep in mind on the Atlantic side is that\u2019s inclusive of our European operations. So we also have exposure in euros and pounds. So it basically was driven more from the international piece for operations versus just looking at domestic.","Faisal Khan","Was FX a big impact or was it relatively small and it was Bayway just the primary driver.","Greg Maxwell","It was relatively small, but the driver really was in the international operations because when we look at Atlantic region, we\u2019re taking into account also our European operations in addition to Bayway.","Faisal Khan","Okay, yes. I can understand like most of the refineries in Europe had a pretty stellar quarter. So I\u2019m just trying to understand the results on the Atlantic side. And I understand Bayway was a bit of a headwind there.","Kevin Mitchell","Faisal, this is Kevin. It\u2019s a function of revaluing the crude payable that we have in the U.K. so we have U.K. functional currency and the revaluation of that dollar denominated payable with a strengthening dollar environment, creates a loss.","Faisal Khan","Okay, okay. Understood. Thanks.","Tim Taylor","Faisal, one last comment from me. Just so we don\u2019t launch another ship today, I would say spinning DCT is way down the list of the same and so I wouldn\u2019t expect that that would emerge as a potential outcome.","Faisal Khan","No, I hear you. And the only reason I\u2019m asking is because - and I understand it\u2019s not a near-term sort of outcome, but it seems like there\u2019s not always alignment at exact point in time between the joint venture partners. And while a long-term sort of alignment seems there, it seems like sometimes in the short run, there seems to be a misalignment. So I\u2019m just trying to understand if the way to solve that is to spin in our loss. But I\u2019m not sure.","Greg Garland","Yes. That\u2019s not the current plan. So I think [indiscernible] and ourselves are aligned around the [indiscernible] we\u2019re progressing our restructuring of the business. We\u2019ll be able to tell you more about it in the coming months. And I think from our perspective, we\u2019re satisfied that the DCT emerging from today as strong company that can meet its commitments and obligations. And we\u2019ll be the preferred supplier in the areas where it does business.","Faisal Khan","Okay. I appreciate those comments. Thanks.","Greg Garland","You bet. You bet.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. I now turn the call back to Mr. Mitchell.","Kevin Mitchell","Thank you very much for participating in the call today. We do appreciate your interest in the company.

My name is Christine and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Clayton Reasor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Affairs. You may begin.","Clayton Reasor","Thanks, Christine. Well, good morning everybody. Welcome to Phillips 66 second quarter earnings conference call. With me this morning are our Chairman and CEO, Greg Garland; our President Tim Taylor; and Chief Financial Officer Greg Maxwell.","The presentation material we will be using this morning can be found in the in Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website along with supplemental, financial and operating information we think you will find helpful.","On slide 2, you can see our Safe Harbor statement. It\u2019s a reminder we\u2019ll be making forward-looking comments during the presentation and our question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from today\u2019s comments and factors that could cause these results to differ are included here on the second page of the presentation as well as in our filings with the SEC.","That said, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg Garland for some opening comments. Greg?","Greg Garland","Okay. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Second quarter earnings were solid, reflecting that we ran well and our Chemical segment had record earnings. However market factors negatively impacted results in our Refining and Midstream businesses. And corporate costs were higher mainly due to increased environmental accruals as well as tax impacts.","Refining, we ran near record utilization rates for the quarter. However, our realized margins were lower than last quarter, largely due to weaker distillate margins along with pure commercial opportunities.","Our Midstream business was negatively impacted by lower propane prices and less demand driven by seasonal factors. We think our disciplined approach to capital allocation is appropriate, given the volatility in our financial results. We are expanding our shareholder distributions while investing in the business with a focus on growing our higher valued segments.","We\u2019ll continue to increase shareholder distributions. Our board approved an additional $2 billion of share repurchases. And during the quarter, we paid an increased dividend of $0.50 per share, which is up 28% from the previous quarter.","At the end of the second quarter, if you look at dividend, share repurchases and share exchange, from the last quarter we\u2019ve returned nearly $7 billion to investors.","At quarter end, our share-count was less than 560 million shares, down 11% since formation. We improved a $1.2 billion increase to our 2014 capital budget, bringing it to $3.9 billion in total. This increased spending were primarily fund the previously acquisitions of crude oil and refined products turned on the U.S. Gulf Coast and specialties lubricants company. In addition, the capital will be directed towards Midstream growth projects such as the Sweeny Frac and Freeport LPG Export facilities.","You can see the progress we\u2019re making on the frac in the picture on the slide. Our focus continues on Midstream organic growth, while we all would like to have more certainty around condensate exports. We continue while we wait options for condensate infrastructure and additional fractionation capacity.","Our MLP Phillips 66 partners\u2019 provides low cost of capital for additional investing. PSXP had a good quarter realizing the full impact of its first acquisition. EBITDA during the second quarter was twice the amount generated at the time of the IPO. We continue to look for opportunities within Phillips 66 externally and organically to grow PSXP and contribute to our Midstream growth strategy.","Our joint ventures continue to grow. In June, CPChem successfully started up the world\u2019s largest on-purpose 1-Hexene plant at Cedar Bayou facility in Baytown, Texas. Also, during the quarter CPChem improved expansion of its Normal Alpha Olefins production capacity at Cedar Bayou by 220 million pounds per year.","At DCP Midstream, work continues on the Zia II plant which is located in the Permian Basin, anticipated startup first half of 2015. And DCP partners\u2019 is constructing in return two plants in the DJ Basin and also expects operations begin in mid-2015.","We\u2019re executing our plans, we\u2019re continuing with our commitments we laid out two years ago. We have a strong balance sheet, $5 billion of cash and a debt to capital ratio with the low end of our targeted range.","We have confidence that we have the resources and the opportunities to deliver on our plans to grow our higher valued businesses, while rewarding the owners of our companies with secure and growing distributions.","So, with that I\u2019m going to hand it over to Greg Maxwell to review the quarterly results.","Greg Maxwell","Thanks Greg, good morning. Starting on slide 4, first quarter earnings were $863 million or $1.51 per share, we had no special items this quarter. Cash from operations excluding working capital for the quarter was $937 million. And for the quarter we paid $281 million in dividends and we purchased 7.5 million shares of common stock for $616 million.","Our debt-to-capital ratio was 22%, and after taking into consideration our end cash balance of $5 billion, our net debt to capital ratio was 5% at the end of the second quarter.","And finally, our annualized adjusted year-to-date return on capital employed for 2014 was 13% as of June 30.","Slide 5, provides a comparison of our second quarter adjusted earnings with that of the first quarter, this is based on a segment basis. Compared to last quarter, second quarter earnings were down $3 million driven by lower results in Midstream, as well as higher corporate segment expenses.","The increased earnings in refining were primarily attributable to higher volumes following the completion of plan turnaround and maintenance activities. I\u2019ll cover each of these segments in more detail as we move forward.","The Midstream segment was negatively impacted in the second quarter by lower gains associated with DCP Midstream partners or DPM unit issuances and weaker NGL prices and demand. The annualized 2014 year-to-date return on capital employed for Midstream was 17% and this is based on an average capital employed of $3.6 billion.","Slide 7, shows Midstream\u2019s second quarter earnings of $108 million, a decrease of $80 million from last quarter. Transportation was in line with last quarter, as improved volume throughput was largely offset by increased planned maintenance activity.","DCP Midstream\u2019s earnings decreased by $50 million compared with the first quarter, the decrease reflects lower gains associated with DPM Unit issuances that were recognized by Phillips 66 along with lower NGL prices specifically propane.","In addition, DCP had turnaround activity as several of its gathering and processing plants resulted in higher operating cost during the second quarter.","And finally, our NGL business line also had lower earnings in the second quarter driven by weaker propane prices and lower demand due to warmer weather.","In Chemicals, the global Olefins and Polyolefins capacity utilization rate for the quarter was 95%. The O&P business benefited from strong margins, while SA&S had impacts due to turnaround activity. The annualized 2014 year-to-date return on capital employed from our Chemicals segment was 29% and this is based on average capital employed of $4.3 billion.","As shown on Slide 9, second quarter earnings for Chemicals were $324 million representing a record earnings quarter for our Chemicals business. In Olefins and Polyolefins, earnings were up mainly due to improved realized O&P chain margins, and this was slightly offset by higher maintenance cost as some of the plant\u2019s first quarter maintenance activities shifted into the second quarter.","The $17 million decrease in Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics was primarily due to lower equity earnings as a result of plant turnaround activity during the second quarter.","Next, I\u2019ll cover refining. We ran our refineries well this quarter, the crude utilization rate was 96% and our claim product yield was 83%. The annualized 2014 year-to-date return on capital employed for Refining was little over 10% with an average capital employed of $13.5 billion.","The Refining segment had earnings of $390 million and this is up from last quarter\u2019s earnings of $306 million. This increase was mainly due to higher utilization rates across all of our regions, slightly offset by weaker realized Refining margins.","Realized Refining margins decreased in all of our regions exception for the Western Pacific region. The decrease was driven by weaker distillate market cracks reduced seasonal blending activity, gasoline activity and also lower secondary product realizations.","In addition, narrowing crude differentials negatively impacted our realized margins. In the Gulf Coast, the LLS Maya differential narrowed by $5.32 per barrel, impacting our Sweeny and our Lake Charles refineries. And on the East Coast the Bakken Brent differential narrowed by $1.43 per barrel impacting our Bayway refinery.","Other refining was down $50 million compared to last quarter, mainly due to less location arbitrage and product blending upgrade opportunities available in the market compared to the first quarter, and also as well as narrowing WTI\/WCS crude differentials.","Next, let\u2019s look at our market capture on slide 12. Our worldwide realized margin in the second quarter was $9.66 per barrel. This resulted in a market capture of 61% and compares with 79% in the first quarter.","On a regional level, the biggest movements were in the Atlantic Basin Europe and Gulf Coast regions. You can find the regional slides in the Appendix of this presentation.","Our Refinery configuration negatively impacted our capture this quarter by $2.73 per barrel, the decrease is a result of our configuration being weighted towards less gasoline and more distillate production than the marker implies.","Secondary products were moreover hurt this quarter than in the past quarter due to NGL prices decreasing along with crude prices increasing. And finally, our feedstock advantage was $1 per barrel lower than last quarter due to narrower crude differentials.","Slide 13 shows the comparison of advantage crude runs at our U.S. refineries by quarter on the left and by year on the right. During the second quarter 93% of the company\u2019s U.S. crude slate was advantaged and this compares with 91% in the first quarter.","This increase was largely due to less turnaround activity in the second quarter. In addition, refining processed a record 305,000 barrels per day of tide oil in the second quarter. And this represents a 48,000-barrel per day improvement over the previous high.","This next slide covers our Marketing and Specialty segment. Both our Marketing and our Specialties businesses had higher volumes this quarter. The annualized 2014 year-to-date return on capital employed for M&S was 25% on an average capital employed of $2.4 billion.","Slide 15, provides some additional detail on our M&S segment. Adjusted earnings for M&S in the second quarter were $162 million representing a $25 million increase from the first quarter. The improvement in marketing earnings primarily reflects higher volumes due to seasonal demand and also increased exports. We exported 181,000 barrels per day this quarter up from last quarter\u2019s exports of 139,000 barrels per day.","Specialties earnings were $43 million for the quarter, and in-line with the first quarter results.","Moving on to Corporate and Other, this segment includes net interest expense, it includes corporate overhead costs and it also includes technology and other costs and accruals that are not allocated to our operating segments. Corporate and Other costs were $121 million after-tax for the second quarter compared with $81 million last quarter. The increase in cost was largely due to change in effective tax rates as well as higher environmental accruals.","And this brings us to the second quarter cash flow. Starting on the left, excluding working capital, cash from operations was $937 million. Cash from operations funded $561 million in capital expenditures and $281 million in dividends. In addition, we repurchased $616 million of our shares through our share repurchase program.","The $150 million for proceeds from asset dispositions is largely related to distributions from WRB which is our 50-50 joint venture with Cenovus Energy. During the first quarter, Cenovus prepaid its partnership contribution payable to the joint venture.","When WRB distributed these funds, our accumulated undistributed equity earnings were reduced to zero. This resulted in any additional distributions in excess of current earnings being accounted for as return of investment. And finally, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5 billion.","This concludes my discussion of the financial and operational results. I\u2019ll next cover a few outlook items. For Chemicals, in early July, there was a localized fire at CPChem\u2019s Port Arthur plant. Our thoughts and our prayers are with the injured employees and their families.","CPChem continues to evaluate the events of Port Arthur, and at this point it is still too early for us to provide some specifics regarding how long the facility will be down or the total financial impact. We do however expect global utilization rates for Olefins and Polyolefins to be in the low 80s during the third quarter.","Also for the third quarter in Refining, we expect worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low-to-mid 90s and pretax turnaround expense to be about $90 million.","Turning to corporate and other, we expect this segment\u2019s after tax cost to run about $110 million per quarter for the remainder of the year, and from a tax perspective, our overall effective income tax rate is expected to be in the mid-30s for the third quarter.","With that, we\u2019ll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks guys, I appreciate you taking my questions.","Greg Garland","Hi Doug.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I\u2019ve got a couple of big picture issues if I may. I mean, you started your prepared remarks Greg, talking about higher utilization rates and lower capture, it seems to be a trend that we\u2019re seeing across a number of your peers.","I\u2019m just curious, is, the higher utilization rate and the higher use of light, light use of crude impacting you to the point where your secondary units are not as efficient as it used to be. I\u2019m just trying to understand the deterioration in the capture rate it seems to be industry issue not necessarily a PSX issue? And I\u2019ve got a follow-up.","Greg Garland","As we, we spent a lot of time trying to buy at the well head for consistency of crude. So, one of our objectives is to avoid the more blended barrel if we can within PSX operations. So I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re constrained in terms of any of our operations given the crude slate that we\u2019re running today.","So, but the market capture question, more broadly around the industry is a good one, I don\u2019t know Tim, you want to?","Tim Taylor","Yes, I think, Doug, you\u2019re looking at secondary coke prices relatively flat and actually declined a bit this quarter. So you\u2019ve got that dynamic of coke and the pure grade competing essentially with coal. And then the LPG prices came down versus the first quarter, so that was a piece of that.","So, but we haven\u2019t really seen that the yield structure other than the value of the light components has really impacted our selection on crude slates.","Greg Maxwell","And I would say the abundance of light fleet crude it didn\u2019t translate into wider crude differentials in the second quarter and that had \u2013 that produced our capture rate as well.","Tim Taylor","Sure.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. My follow-up I guess, every quarter we tend to revisit the West Coast system. The reason I would like to bring it up again if I may fellows is my follow-up is, we thought you announce this Petrochemical project. And our understanding is that there could be more to come which ultimately has the impact of tightening up the gas fleet market, I expect over time in the West Coast.","So, I\u2019m just wondering, first of all, are you thinking along similar lines of, have you given thoughts to any \u2013 how Phillips could perhaps contribute to tightening the gasoline market by perhaps exporting Petrochemical feedstock? Or if the market did tighten up what would it mean for the strategic positioning of your West Coast system, could it improve enough to become by kind of core part to the portfolio and not altogether there? Thanks.","Greg Garland","Yes, so, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re looking at any chemicals investments on the West Coast. As we think about the West Coast, fundamentally we want to run well and optimize and that\u2019s around getting advantage crude to the front of the refineries. We don\u2019t have any big investments in front of us on the West Coast. Obviously, quarter-over-quarter, West Coast was better, second quarter than first quarter.","We think it remains a challenged environment but given the position we have and the cost structure of our refineries and where they sit relative to the peers, I think we\u2019re in a pretty good position on the West Coast.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks for taking the questions guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning guys.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I know you recently raised 2014 CapEx and the buyback authorization simultaneously. And maybe a general question on how you think about forward Midstream CapEx, I mean, given the percentage of Midstream spending, additional attractive organic opportunities. How does you MLP in the potential to monetize your Midstream spending at a much faster rate than the typical long-wide asset affect your view on future Midstream spending? And I have a follow-up please.","Greg Garland","Well, I think at our Analyst Day, we kind of weighed out \u201814, \u201815 and \u201816 and we weighed out $12 billion of growth opportunities essentially seven of it to PSX level. And most of that was directed as Midstream. I think we see many opportunities in Midstream and we will be opportunistic.","I think a recent announcement of the acquisition of the Gulf Coast crude oil and products terminal is an example of that. So, when we see an opportunity we\u2019ll certainly, we\u2019ll move on that. And then specifically around the MLP, we view that is a tool in the toolbox that we could use to execute our Midstream growth program and\/or accelerate the growth at Midstream with that MLP. And certainly I think you\u2019ll see us do that.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Maybe a similar question, I think it\u2019s what you just showed us to put a finer point on it. But as you affect the portfolio shift that we \u2013 I guess, you and I believe would drive a re-rating in your EBITDA. Your CapEx also rises, I mean, do you see your balance sheet liquidity essential MLP liquidity speaking of dropdowns as a method for maintaining or increasing distributions despite a rise in CapEx number?","Greg Maxwell","No, I think that we think about executing the plan, we think about our balance sheet and the capabilities of our balance sheet. We think we have $4 billion to $5 billion of capacity on the balance sheet, we could use. We have $5 billion of cash that we could use. And then certainly we have continued asset sales and\/or going to the MLP. And so I think we have a robust funding mechanism to move this Midstream transformation board with our company.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, and then one last one from me if I could. I mean, the economics are really fantastic for your LPG facility project given the cost at over 6 turn cap rate, a potential sale of MLP to 10 turn cap rate and a recapture of a portion of the EBITDA for the GP and LP units, which will also improve your returns. I mean, any thoughts here, any kind of scope out of earnings potential second stage here or just kind of market depth of expansion and I\u2019ll leave it there? Thanks.","Greg Garland","Yes, I want you to take that.","Tim Taylor","Evan, we\u2019ve continued to see solid demand around the export piece for propane, butane and pentane, that\u2019s all part of that LPG facility. So, we\u2019ve been encouraged in the market, we have said that \u2013 we\u2019re looking at 8 BLGC carriers per month as our initial thinking.","But currently they were able to go to 12, and I think as the market demand continues to grow and the options develop, I think that\u2019s something that we look forward to expanding. So, as we look down the road that\u2019s a key piece of where we\u2019d like to continue to grow.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Good morning everyone. First of all, just a bit of a follow-up as regards to throughputs, you\u2019re at 96% utilization overall. But I think you had quite a few refineries that weren\u2019t running full capacity. That would imply that some of your refineries ran over 100%, utilization? Does that is that a function of the light Sweep throughput? And can we expect you to go even higher in utilization for example in Q3 now, that\u2019s part one? Thanks.","Greg Garland","So, to answer the last one first, I think we just guided to low-90s to mid-90s in utilization on the third quarter call. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a function of running more lights sweet crude necessarily. We did do at alliance turnaround some work that allowed us to run more Eagle Ford at Alliance but it really didn\u2019t necessarily increase overall throughput at alliance. It was just avoiding some of the issues we had when we ran the Eagle Ford.","So, you\u2019re actually right. There were refineries that ran above 100% utilization. And the way we manage that internally, once we demonstrate our higher utilization rate for a period of time, we\u2019re going \u2013 we\u2019ll increase that effective capacity of that refinery in our numbers. But we need to be able to demonstrate that.","But look across the system, the refineries ran well in the quarter. We expected that coming out of the turnarounds in the first quarter and generally you\u2019ll see that performance coming out of turnarounds.","But generally they ran well. And I think you\u2019re always going to have some ups and some downs and in and outs and we did during the quarter. We had some issues, we had small fire at buildings and so we saw some reduced capacity and throughput at our billings facilities. But in generally I\u2019ll tell you across the system, solid operations.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","So, but you\u2019re implying that your capacity will go up, I don\u2019t quite understand if it\u2019s not more light sweet crude was causing that to happen? I mean, if you\u2019re running at over 100%, it implies you\u2019re going to have a higher capacity?","Greg Garland","It\u2019s not the light sweet crude that\u2019s allowing us to run it over 100%, I guess that\u2019s what we\u2019re saying.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay.","Tim Taylor","Yes, I think its two things Paul. Specifically maybe Ponca City as an example, a more consistent crude slate leads to more consistent operations. So we\u2019ve made great strides there. And then we\u2019ve continued to focus on how to improve reliability. And I think that shows up as well. So, it\u2019s really the two-point approach.","So, relatively minor I would say capacity creep that really driven off those two things versus, significant investments in terms of distillation capacity or other types of ways to do that.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Great, thanks. And then just for the MLP outlook you mentioned, you made an acquisition that you\u2019re finding that there is plenty more stuff out there for you to buy, and can you just talk about the framework of what the asset market looks like to keep that growth going? Thanks very much and I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.","Greg Garland","Thanks Paul.","Greg Maxwell","So, just generally Paul, we don\u2019t comment a lot on M&A. Assets are pretty fully valued today. And so I think you have to look into that deeper value question about when you see the opportunity to expand around your system and drive the synergies to make that work. So, we\u2019re always looking and we\u2019ve had a couple of opportunities this last quarter. And we were able to do that. So, I think that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to look at that as we go forward.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes, good morning. Couple of quick ones firstly on cash flow, $937 million before working capital I think was the number. I mean, obviously that\u2019s a bit lower than what you\u2019ve been doing recently, I mean, obviously earnings could be part of that.","But two of the line items in the cash flow statement, one is deferred tax which last year was running sort of at a positive. And in the second \u2013 forget the first quarter because I think there was some one-offs. But in the second quarter a slight negative. Maybe talk a little bit about deferred tax?","And then the other line item is the associates or equity investments seem to be investing a little bit above DD&A and obviously we\u2019re expecting them to in order to drive some of the growth when we think about the Chemicals and Midstream associates. But it felt like that was a little earlier than they had in the plan? I thought that was more going to be 2015, so maybe just if you could help us walk through those particular line items in the cash flow statement? Thank you.","Greg Maxwell","Yes, this is Greg. With regard to the deferred tax, we had some one-off things that hit that. And I don\u2019t have all the details with me right now. And we can call you and give you that additional detail.","With regard to the undistributed equity earnings and the cash flows that are coming out of our JVs, we had a bit of an anomaly as I talked about in the first quarter with regard to WRB pan out the dividend from the prepayment of the loan outstanding to Cenovus. So that was a bit of an anomaly of cash flow coming out from that perspective.","And then, as we\u2019ve talked about with CPChem and marking on their large project, building the cracker and the two polyethylene units down on the Gulf Coast, we expect them to be fully funded from cash from operating activities. But as a result of that spending, we will end up seeing less distributions coming out of CPChem during this period of time of heavy spending really in 2015-2016.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, on the small Bolton acquisitions I mean, any idea of rough range of acquisition multiples?","Greg Garland","Ed, roughly I would say they\u2019re in the comparables and the specialty lubricants area of what you kind of see \u2013 I think as we said, they\u2019re fully valued. And then, I think as we\u2019ve looked just we can turn we just see great opportunities. So that\u2019s a really key acquisition in terms of the pivot points around the Gulf Coast both in refined products and crude oil.","And so, we see a lot of forward opportunity given our logistics infrastructure as well as our refining LPG and their products distribution in the Gulf Coast. So, I think that we feel that these are going to be very positive developments on both fronts from an earnings perspective and a good value.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","So, if I understood correctly, typically the EBITDA multiples say year one but Phillips has ways to add value to the assets that it\u2019s purchased over time?","Greg Garland","Absolutely.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, okay, great. And then, just a question obviously, with the BIS discussing the fact that I was down there last week, met those folks. If you distill oil and if it looks like it\u2019s a product on Schedule B, then that doesn\u2019t appear that they might stand in the way of that type of activity going on which is, makes sense to me.","Now, some of the things that would then fit in that condensate exports, but as you go into deeper API crudes, I mean, obviously you could top API crudes down in the Gulf and then sell the intermediate products. Have you looked at any of that sort of topping type capacity and whether it would meet your hurdle requirements? Or does that fall under Greg\u2019s 40% IRR, require because it\u2019s refining investment?","Greg Garland","We all like those.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Right.","Greg Maxwell","So, I think we\u2019re looking at a range of opportunities there in terms of just general condensate infrastructure Ed. So, I mean, it could be gathering, it could be pipeline, it could be export facility, it could be topping, it could be full range splitting into the more complex product slate.","As you know, at our LPG facility we\u2019re putting 350,000 barrel essentially condensate tanks it that were under construction. So, certainly that\u2019s a piece of the equation that we\u2019re looking at. I think there is some uncertainty around condensates and exports, they may be giving some people some pause around speculative splitters, we\u2019ll see.","But regardless of what happens there, there are four things you need to do and three of them are right down the fairway what we\u2019d like to do in our Midstream business.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Dietert of Simmons. Please go ahead.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Company","Good morning.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Greg Maxwell","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Company","One broad question, a strategic question, and one more detailed question, if I could. You\u2019ve talked about capital allocation being 60% reinvest, and 40% generously back to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. How rigid or flexible is this guideline? I guess it\u2019s dependent on a number of considerations, including level of cash flow, attractiveness of investment opportunities, and level of the stock price relative to your view of intrinsic value. But could you talk about how you see this evolving over time?","Greg Garland","Yes, I think \u2013 Jeff, I think that that was a broad statement in terms of how we think about cash. And cash could be funds from operations, it could be cash from the balance sheet, it could be raised through debt, it could be dropping assets in the MLP.","And I think we\u2019ve consistently said that we would use all of those vehicles for cash generation if we\u2019re lower sources of cash to fund our forward program. So it\u2019s a pretty aggressive program in terms of organic growth, it\u2019s also rewarding our shareholders with secure growing distributions that\u2019s growing the dividends.","We talk about minimal 10% type double-digit dividend increases plus continuing our share repurchases as long as it\u2019s our share price trades below our view of intrinsic value. So that\u2019s kind of what we look at is we\u2019re thinking about that.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Company","Thanks. Secondly, Borger, you had some downtime, major turnaround in March, and then there was a lot in the press about 30-day-plus outage in July. Could you talk about what was down in July, was it planned, unplanned, what activity was going on there?","Greg Garland","Yes, so I would just say that Borger hasn\u2019t run well this year. And so we\u2019re working on improving operational reliability at Borger really to me are expectations. But the July event, by the way Borger is back up and running today. But July then was unplanned outage.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Company","Thank you.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Hi guys, good morning. Greg, I presume, I know the answer, but anyway, just to confirm, Citco, seems like that they were trying to sell their refining asset in the U.S. We should assume that you guys would have absolutely no interest to further expand your U.S. refining capacity?","Greg Garland","I don\u2019t know, I think we\u2019ve consistently said we have better opportunities to invest in our Midstream and our Chemicals business Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Right. On the PSXP, any more internal prediction or forecast how quickly you could reach the high speed for the GP?","Tim Taylor","Yes. So Paul, we\u2019re with this last distribution increase. We\u2019re close we\u2019re \u2013 so I think reasonable growth in EBITDA in that MLP would put us there. I think that we\u2019re very close to that goal. So we\u2019ve doubled the EBITDA in the MLP with this last acquisition. And that\u2019s hard to push us toward that so as the earnings and distributions grow, we\u2019re getting a much more close to being to the maximum high-split on the IDR.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","And maybe that this is more for Greg, just as a request. Going forward, as you\u2019re reaching the high speed, if you can actually somewhere in your press release, just how everyone had \u2013 what is your GP cash flow for the quarter, I think that would be really helpful in terms of highlighting the value of what is that GP may be?","And also in your chemical for CPC, thank you very much for the information that you give out, the DD&A and all that. But I believe that is not including the corresponding share of CPC on some of the chemical joint ventures. In that, you would be able to also put that, so we can get a full picture of what is the full depreciation related to that business that would be great.","Greg Garland","Okay. Well, first of all, on the first suggestion, great suggestion. We\u2019ll do that in terms of the GP cash. On CPC, we\u2019re working that, that\u2019s a little more difficult. But we recognized that is a deficiency in terms of people seeing that through EBITDA that\u2019s embedded down at the joint ventures within the joint venture.","Greg Maxwell","One of the things we\u2019re attempting to do on that Paul, is you\u2019ve probably seen in the supplemental information is look at it from a proportionally consolidated perspective and look past the equity earnings and give you the different components. And I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for right?","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","That\u2019s correct. Yes. And because that\u2019s a little bit complicated since we have joint venture within joint venture. So, if you guys can help us to get a better, full picture that would be great in terms of the valuation. Three other quick questions, first, Greg, do you have the market value of your inventory in excess of the bulk?","Greg Maxwell","Paul that runs in the second quarter, it stood at about right at $8 million.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Secondly, that I think in your slide, you were talking about the secondary product related to the configuration or benchmark, there\u2019s a drop in the Western Pacific region by about, say, $8-something.","And that\u2019s about $2.50 or $2.40 per barrel worse than that discount in the first quarter. Can you give us a little bit better understanding that what may have caused that? Which particular secondary product is causing that substantial deterioration?","Greg Garland","So, I think again, that was almost $3.50 a barrel something like that. And what we saw, we actually saw coke prices go down and we saw LPG prices or NGL prices go down. So it was just a direct result of higher fleet stocks and lower costs for the products or lower values for the products.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Greg, are you talking about the thermal coke or that you guys selling a specialty coke?","Greg Garland","Thermal, yeah.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","It\u2019s thermal coke?","Greg Garland","Yes.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Okay. A final one, maybe this is for Tim. Tim, have you seen any evidence that oil ones, they travel down to South Texas being trapped in Houston and have not been able to very cost effectively move to Louisiana side or that you guys haven\u2019t really seen that?","Tim Taylor","No, I think that\u2019s continuing to be an issue that the infrastructure on the Gulf still is not sufficient to move some of these lighter crudes into Louisiana as much as we\u2019d like to see. I think that\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen little bit with recent LLS move. So that\u2019s still developing that will improve. But yes, I think that we continue to see that disconnect between the Texas and Louisiana side on the light side.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","I see. Thank you.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Yes, good morning.","Greg Maxwell","Hi Roger.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","I guess, maybe a specific question, getting back to a combination of things. Number one, your comments earlier about buying your crude direct as opposed to blended, how that fits in with some of the new pipeline capacity coming from West Texas.","And then also how maybe this recent change in the condensate export rules plays into that in terms of the types of crude you\u2019ve been buying that have been blended. I know that\u2019s wide ranging but I\u2019m trying to get a feel for what you may or may not see in terms of API and then just how much condensate is blended in at this point?","Tim Taylor","Yes, we don\u2019t \u2013 I would say today the large proportion of condensate is in the crude piece. And you\u2019ve certainly seen the blended barrel gravity start to come up. The value that we see is with particularly and you look at the mid-Con in Ponca City border being able \u2013 on top of the producing fields to go direct help.","Similar approach we\u2019re taking in the Eagle Ford expanding that. And so, and buying in the Bakken, where you canvas with segregated distinct batches all help that consistency. And we\u2019ve actually increased that volume and we\u2019ll continue look at ways to do that because we think that adds additional value on the refining side of our business. So, that\u2019s actually a concentrated effort on our commercial side to increase that.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Thanks. And in terms of the change with the rules, I mean, what\u2019s your expectation on how quickly that can actually have an impact? I mean, we know what the first two were, we know that there\u2019s been some sort of a haul placed, at least in the near term. How are you thinking about, in terms of the ability for the industry to get this out of here that it will ultimately flow back into the impact on the type of crudes you are seeing running and in your ability to take advantage of that?","Tim Taylor","Well, first, we do expect condensate production to continue to grow. So I think that has to be dealt with. And then they still need particularly if you\u2019re going to export, you just looked at that to say you got to get the infrastructure where you can segregate you can\u2019t co-mingle.","And so that\u2019s still developing and that is the opportunity that Greg was talking about earlier about these opportunity to bring it from the field into the markets that we\u2019re processing. So, I think it\u2019s still early, still developing. I think that\u2019s going to evolve.","But I think that some type of distillation probably starts to sit up that play that length in condensate will eventually leave the U.S. in some form or another. Because that\u2019s where the demand is going to be and that\u2019s really what you got to serve.","So the key is to figure out which pieces work right now. But if it stays in the crude we\u2019re going to continue to find ways to drive that to the refineries. And there is still probably likely to be a more segregated system that drives it directly.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, and then, just an unrelated follow-up question on the chemicals business. Greg, getting back to your comments on the cash flow side that overall that\u2019s not a segment that\u2019s going to deliver a lot of cash flow to the corporate level.","If the Port Arthur facility is going to be off-line for a significant period of time and I\u2019m not asking you to predict that, I\u2019m just saying if that turns out to be the case, does that have a meaningful impact on the cash flows?","Or, another way of asking the question is there any risk that your CapEx will actually have to increase to make up for any potential shortfalls in the chemicals side next year?","Greg Garland","I would say from what we know now what we see now, we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have to put equity into the CPChem. They\u2019ll continue to fund their programs and distributing cash back to the owners.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Even with the unit down for a long period of time?","Greg Garland","Yes, I don\u2019t know, we don\u2019t know how long the units are going to be down at this point. And I think anything we would do might just be speculative and so we\u2019re probably not going to go there today.","There was a localized buyer and so, I think we can probably give you more guidance in a month or so as we get there. But certainly our view is that that unit, there is no reason that unit would be down for a prolonged period of time, yes.","Tim Taylor","Yes.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Thank you.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Hi guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had two for you. The first, I\u2019ve always viewed one of the real competitive advantages for PSX is your elevated distillate yield in the refining system. And just in reviewing your supplemental data here, I was looking at the yield on a worldwide basis.","It looks like it\u2019s trended a little bit lower here into 2Q at 38%, which had been trending around 39% or 40%. I\u2019m just curious, as you begin to increase, or continue to increase the domestic advantaged runs of light sweet, do you expect that to have an impact on your distillate yield going forward?","Greg Garland","I think I mean, we\u2019re continuing to look for ways that we can increase distillate yield. Certainly in this quarter, that maybe would be wrong way to go directionally since gasoline crack was up $7 and distillate was down $3.75. But as you think about where the world is going and we think distillate continues to grow two to three times the gasoline demand globally, we think distillate \u2013 increasing distillate make sense.","Having said that, we\u2019re not going to spend a lot of money to do that, but we do think we\u2019ve got a 1% to 2% yield capture and distillate that we can affect over the next year or two in terms of operations. And I think we probably wore down in the second quarter on distillate production.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay, great. Thanks, Greg. The second question, really the underlying question is on the pacing of buybacks. But, I guess, first and foremost, with the upward revision on CapEx in \u201814, is it fair to think that there\u2019s an upward bias to the \u201815 numbers that you provided in April?","And, I guess, secondly, obviously that would hurt free cash flow. Is it fair to think that the pacing of buybacks may slow a bit as you digest some of the M&A and some of the elevated spend here until you get a contribution from those assets going forward?","Greg Garland","That\u2019s not what we\u2019re thinking today.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay.","Greg Maxwell","I don\u2019t think when we look at cash flow generation over the next two or three years, it looks like there is sufficient cash to fund the increase in capital that we\u2019ve built into 2014 and continue a fairly significant reduction in share count through repurchase. So, the increase is predicated on just executing the plan that we\u2019ve got in front of us. I don\u2019t think we have any intention of reducing our share repurchase in order to fund additional CapEx.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay. And just to clarify is it fair to think of maybe some upward pressure in \u201815 compared to what you provided in April?","Greg Garland","So, we gave guidance at the Analyst Meeting somewhere around $3.5 billion to $4 billion of capital in 2015 and \u201816. I think those are good numbers to work with right now. We\u2019re just getting, we\u2019re just getting indications from the businesses today as far as what they would like to spend.","We still believe that having constrained capital programs make sense, forces the business is really to select the best projects. But I don\u2019t really see us meaningfully increasing the capital spend in \u201815 or \u201816.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay, thanks Greg.","Greg Garland","Of course we\u2019ll give you updates on that as we get into the fall. We\u2019ll be talking to our board about what they\u2019re comfortable with as well. But there are a lot of things that we\u2019re looking at today. I mean, we\u2019re really building a nice queue of capital programs in the Midstream business that we\u2019re interested in pursuing. And but, we certainly don\u2019t want to pull back from our share repurchase program.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks, good morning, just a few questions on the midstream side. With the Beaumont acquisition, is Chevron the only customer, at least the majority of the revenues for that facility? And how do you envision running that facility for your own refineries and operations?","Tim Taylor","Faisel, I will get the customer but if there are other people in that terminal today and really as we\u2019ve looked at it, we want to really expand that terminal and that base. And so we think about it A, you\u2019ve got shown operations, you\u2019ve got (inaudible) relatively close, you\u2019ve got connections in the Texas.","And then these new crude lines, all come into Beaumont area. And the connections you can make there, you\u2019ve got a marine dock with that. So I think that we\u2019ve thought about it that we just see tremendous third party as well as PSX activity that can be tied to that terminal both the crude side as well as the product side.","So I think as we go forward, we\u2019ll continue to develop that asset connectivity and drive really volumes and across our systems but also importantly opening that up and having a lot of third party opportunity there as well.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. And just to clarify, that facility would definitely be eligible to be dropped into the MLP, is that right?","Greg Garland","That\u2019s correct.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. And then on the accelerated development of the LPG export terminal and the Sweeny fractionators, in your analyst day presentation you talked about Sweeny Fractionator 1 coming on in \u201815 and I think the LPG export terminal coming on in \u201816. Does the accelerated capital spending that you guys got Board approval for, does that push the LPG terminal into \u201815 and maybe Sweeny the beginning of \u201815?","Greg Garland","No, we\u2019re really still on our target startup date we\u2019re still on budget in terms of our total expected cost. This is really reflects a spending curve coming in faster than we expected. But total labor hours, material costs, all those things are just moving forward from where we were on that piece. And but we have not changed the schedule on that. But the good news is on target, on budget.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. So, just earlier spending and then in the later years you\u2019ll have less spending than what you thought, I guess?","Greg Garland","Correct.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. And then just going back to your comments around the splitters, not too long ago you guys had talked about possibly building a splitter around your facilities. It sounds like that\u2019s on hold now, pending what happens with condensate exports. Is that a fair assumption?","Tim Taylor","I think we should that there is an infrastructure opportunity beyond just a splitter. So we\u2019re still very active in looking at both the design on the splitter as an opportunity as well as infrastructure. And I think it\u2019s really for us, it\u2019s kind of the decision is simple as a complex splitter, what you want to but then how does that fit the refining operations that\u2019s still ongoing. But we still see an opportunity there on the condensate side.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, that\u2019s fair. And then you guys talked about in the past a pipeline solution to move crude oil from west to east on the Gulf Coast. Have you guys moved that project forward, or is there any more clarity around what the scope of that project could be?","Tim Taylor","Yes, I think that Beaumont gives us additional access point and opportunity as you think about our system. And so that\u2019s part of our thinking as we go forward as to how do we use that more effectively to really look at connections out that terminal to get into Louisiana. So, we\u2019re actively studying marine as well as pipeline options around that.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. And then last question to me. With Cushing inventories having been depleted more recently, and another drawdown today, does that have any impact on Ponca and Borger? Or do you do all, your inventory inside the refining fence, or do you look at the Cushing market, the Cushing storage tanks, also, to balance that?","Greg Garland","I think actually having the refineries there actually gives us additional flexibility with the storage they have. So it is not impacted the operations. Clearly Cushing needs to replenish, its right at the minimum. But I think have the operations there actually gives us a degree of flexibility of we\u2019re just having a market center source there.","Remember again, we take a lot of that crude in Ponca border comes from locally gathered systems as well, particularly in borders. So that really, it\u2019s a nice tie but it\u2019s not an absolute must that we connect the two together to the operation.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, understood. I appreciate the time. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question is from Bradley Olsen of Tudor Pickering. Please go ahead.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering","Hi, good morning everyone.","Greg Garland","Hi Brad.","Greg Maxwell","Good morning Brad.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering","A couple more questions. I think my questions have been pretty picked over but I did want to follow up on the Beaumont facility. Obviously we are seeing quite a bit of activity around the Gulf Coast on the storage side. And storage rates have been reported by some of your midstream competitors as being pretty attractive and improving.","You guys certainly have a lot of storage, both inside and outside the refinery gate on the Gulf Coast. When you think about the valuations that you have seen in the market, and saw in the Beaumont process, does it really change the way that you think of your already-owned facilities and maybe the values that they could be dropped down into an MLP?","Tim Taylor","No, I mean, obviously we\u2019re encouraged by valuation in the Midstream from our own perspective. And then we\u2019d agree we see the opportunity. So, I think that\u2019s been \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about that, that\u2019s part of our plan to grow. And then, on top of that organic and the acquisitions piece and I think we just put it all together and share great Midstream opportunity. But it does highlight the value of our Midstream assets that were initially embedded so to speak in our transportation reporting system.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering","Okay. Great. And the Beaumont facility, which was a combined terminal and dock facility, with all of the increased maritime activity along the Gulf Coast, are you getting to a point where you see the dock portion of that asset as being maybe somewhat of a scarce resource in the Texas Gulf Coast area?","Greg Garland","Yes, we think the dock is going to be well utilized and that was part of the attracting for us is another option to either from a products or a crude standpoint to take advantage and capture that. But I think, product side, crude side, you just can see a lot of logistics moves and that\u2019s why we like this particular location asset.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering","Okay. Great. And as we think about the still uncertain outcomes of the condensate decision, knowing that there is maybe potential for 700,000 barrels a day of condensate maybe hit the water at a lower cost, or more easily than maybe the market previously thought, does that increase opportunities for your existing Jones Act tankers?","Does it make you more interested to get involved further in that market or change the way that you\u2019re thinking about the usage of those vessels between Texas and Louisiana, or Texas and the East Coast?","Greg Garland","We\u2019ve continued to optimize that movement based on the relative value of refining. And so, condensate it\u2019s a fuzzy definition. But the light crude utilization still makes a lot of sense. The condensate just spend how that goes, you can actually open up international opportunity with that perhaps on some of the product side.","So I think we\u2019ve kind of thought about it that way but I think we still like our utilization on marine vessels in that light even, lighter crude fraction. But just to be how things develop, we have a lot of flexibility around that.","Greg Maxwell","I\u2019ll just add, I think second quarter the MR vessels were fully utilized. The question is it\u2019s just an optimization and how do you want to use them, Eagle Ford to Alliance or Eagle Ford to Bayway. And so I think we\u2019ll always run those numbers and do the things that generate the most value on that.","I think we\u2019ve said previously we would have an interest in acquiring an additional Jones Act capability. So, we\u2019re always looking around that.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering","Okay. And just a follow-up on the chemicals side of things. With the start up of the 1-Hexene facility, it\u2019s always a little bit difficult to pin down the granular project cost at the JV level. But is there a good sequential EBITDA uptick number that we should think about? And will we see full EBITDA contribution reached later this year or early in 2015?","Greg Maxwell","So, this is 550 million pound per year 1-Hexene plant. Still see good demand for that, it uses a kind of a smaller amount of raw material and polyethylene production. And so that\u2019s going to have a ramp-up period. We have talked about the investment being in the order of $200 million or so. And I think that long range return of 15% to 20% on those is kind of the way that I look at that. And it will take a period of time to reach that. But I would say that we\u2019re hitting the market I think at a pretty good time.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering","And that\u2019s used to develop polyethylene at CPC facilities or is that going to be marketed to third-party consumers, as well?","Greg Garland","Almost all polyethylene will use some type of command where they call it and Hexane being the big piece that butane being the smaller piece. So that\u2019s a global market and it deals within CPChem as well as other producers.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering","Perfect. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Clayton Reasor.","Clayton Reasor","Well, thank you very much for participating in the call this morning. We do appreciate your interest in the company.

My name is Ken, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only-mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Clayton Reasor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Affairs. Mr. Reasor, you may begin.","Clayton Reasor - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Affairs","Thank you, Ken. Good morning and welcome to Phillips 66 third quarter conference call. We appreciate your interest in our company.","Before we get started, we wanted to share our concern about those hurt by Hurricane Sandy. Many of our employees, shareholders, customers, and friends were impacted by this devastating storm. And we are supportive of efforts being made to help get lives back to normal. Our thoughts and prayers are with you all.","Joining me this morning are Tim Taylor, EVP, Commercial, Transportation, Business Development, and Marketing as well as Greg Maxwell, Executive Vice President, Finance and our CFO.","We'll give you details about our third quarter financial results provide some guidance about the fourth quarter and communicate our plans for growth and enhancing returns, which allow us to increase future distributions to shareholders. The presentation material we will use this morning can be found on the Investor Relations section of Phillips 66 website along with supplemental, financial, and operating information.","Slide two contains our Safe Harbor statement. It\u2019s a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments and factors that could cause our actual results to differ are included here on the second page, as well as in our filings with the SEC.","So, that said, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Greg Maxwell to take you through our third quarter results. Greg?","Greg Maxwell - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Clayton. Good morning everyone. I'll start on slide three with some highlights for the third quarter. Our reported earnings were $1.6 billion or $2.51 per share. Excluding approximately $300 million in special items largely related to impairments, our adjusted earnings were $1.9 billion or $2.97 a share. Excluding special items, our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed is 21%, which is up from 18% in the second quarter with cash from operations coming in at $1.9 billion. Consistent with our stated intent to return capital to our shareholders, we commenced our share repurchase plan in August, purchasing over $100 million of common stock during the quarter and we also paid $125 million in dividends.","Now, let's turn to slide four for a high-level look at our third quarter adjusted earnings. Compared to the third quarter of 2011 our adjusted earnings increased by $369 million. Starting from the left side of the slide, Refining and Marketing generated $1.7 billion in earnings with the majority of the $400 million improvement driven by much stronger refining margins due largely by improved crack spreads.","Midstream earnings were $56 million, which excludes the $133 million special item related to the impairment of our 25% ownership interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline. On an adjusted basis, Midstream earnings were approximately $60 million lower than last year and this decline in earnings reflects reduction in equity earnings from DCP Midstream driven primarily by lower NGL prices.","Chemicals earnings of $275 million, which excludes $122 million of special items primarily associated with CPChem's early retirement of $400 million of debt along with some asset impairments. Adjusted earnings were approximately $80 million higher than the corresponding quarter of 2011 and this was mainly due to higher margins and lower utility costs. I will cover each of these operating segments in more detail later in the presentation. Excluding $13 million of repositioning costs, corporate and other costs this quarter were $112 million. The negative $65 million variance is largely due to higher interest expense on debt that was not in place last year prior to the spin.","Now let\u2019s take a look at cash flow for the third quarter as shown on slide five. During the quarter we generated $1.9 billion in cash from operations including $200 million of positive impacts from net working capital changes. As noted on the slide we funded $300 million for our capital program primarily Refining and Marketing related and returned more than $200 million to the shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. Our cash balance increased by $1.3 billion resulting in $4.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide six for a look at our capital structure and our returns. We ended the third quarter with $21 billion in equity and $8 billion of debt resulting in a debt to capital ratio of 28%, which is 2% lower than last quarter. Taking into account our $4.4 billion ending cash balance, our net debt to capital ratio was 15%. On an adjusted basis our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed was 21%, this is up from 14% in 2011. This improvement was driven primarily by higher refining \u2013 higher earnings in our Refining and Marketing and Chemicals segments. We ended the quarter with $29 billion in capital employed, up $2 billion compared to the second quarter. 74% of our capital employed was R&M related, down from 76% in the second quarter.","Next we\u2019ll cover each of our operating segments in more detail starting with Refining and Marketing on slide seven. In R&M we ran very well in a strong margin environment. Globally, we ran at a 96% utilization rate despite our Alliance refinery being down for approximately three weeks related to the impact of Hurricane Isaac and our clean product yield was 83%. As part of our ongoing strategy to enhance returns, we are taking steps to process more North American advantaged crudes. During the third quarter 63% of our U.S. crude slate was advantaged and this was up from an average of 61% for the first three quarters of the year. Marketing margins were lower this quarter and we will cover this in more detail later in the webcast. Our refining realized margin was $17.05 per barrel and our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed improved to 22%.","Let\u2019s now turn to slide eight where we will cover adjusted earnings for Refining and Marketing. Earnings for R&M were $1.7 billion this quarter. This is up from $1.3 billion a year ago reflecting significant improvements in our Atlantic Basin in Europe and Central Corridor regions, partially offset by lower earnings from Marketing, Specialties and Other or as we refer to as MSO. In the Atlantic Basin region earnings increased due to improved refining margins and lower controllable costs. Margins improved largely as a result of higher crack spreads, while controllable costs for lower primarily due to the Trainer and Wilhelmshaven refineries no longer being in our portfolio.","Gulf Coast earnings were up slightly due to high refining margins as market cracks were partially offset by lower product differentials and lower secondary product realizations. The Central Corridor improved significantly this quarter due to higher refining margins reflecting our advantaged feedstock position in the region as the WTI, WCS differential widened. And we had increased the amount of our sour crude processed at the Wood River and Ponca City refineries.","The Western Pacific region\u2019s earnings were higher this quarter compared to a year ago primary due to higher refining margins. U.S. Marketing, Specialties and Other was down by $95 million. This is primarily due to lower margins and the negative impact associated with Hurricane Isaac. And internationally MSO was down $60 million mainly as a result of lower margins.","The next few slides highlight our performance in Refining and provide more detail on MSO. So, now turning to slide nine, Refining\u2019s adjusted earnings increased over $500 million compared to a year ago, improved margins were the key driver with higher market cracks and higher feedstock advantages being partially offset by less favorable product differentials and secondary products. Earnings were up $55 million as a result of higher volumes, mainly in the Central Corridor where we were able to take advantage of lower cost crudes. And we also have lower operating costs largely due to no longer having the Trainer and Wilhelmshaven refineries in our portfolio.","Let\u2019s now take a look at our market capture shown on slide 10. Here we look at our global market and realized crack spreads. The market crack was very strong this quarter and we captured nearly 80% of the market crack, up nearly 10% form the second quarter. Our realized margin for the quarter was over $17 per barrel and we capitalized on these favorable margins by operating well with 96% utilization rate.","As I mentioned earlier our actual claim product yield for the quarter was 83%, which results in the $3.42 adjustment shown on the slide. The $5.39 per barrel reduction related to secondary products reflects the fact that the non-clean products we produced attracted a sales price which on average was lower than the cost of our benchmark crudes. The positive $4.82 per barrel for feedstocks stems from crudes and other feedstocks that are priced lower than our benchmark crudes. Our feedstock advantage this quarter was primarily related to the Canadian heavy and foreign sour crudes that we processed as well as increased shale and WTI-based crudes on the Gulf Coast. Finally, the other category primarily reflects the impact of product differentials. You will see in the appendix that we've also included updated market indicator crack spreads for each of our regions.","So, moving on to slide 11, this slide shows that during the year we've increased advantaged crude runs at our refineries while also improving our clean product yield. Many of our refineries have the complexity to run advantaged Canadian crudes and we have access to multiple transportation systems to reliably deliver these crudes to our U.S. refineries resulting in an overall competitive advantage. U.S. advantaged curdes increased from 52% last year to 61% year-to-date in 2012. This was primarily driven on increasing Canadian heavy crudes as well as domestic WTI price linked streams including an increase in the amount of shale crudes that we processed. Please note that the bar graph on the left has been updated from what we shared with you last quarter as we are now providing additional detail on different types if U.S. crude slates that we run.","Now moving on to slide 12, Marketing, Specialties and Other generated earnings of $95 million, that\u2019s $154 million lower than the same quarter last year. As shown on the slide, lower margins were the main driver for the decrease accounting for approximately $130 million of the variance. We saw large swings quarter versus quarter as we had gains last year related to inventory management compared with losses this year. Also impacting margins were product prices rising more sharply this year compared to last year tied mainly to the impact or the impacts from Hurricane Isaac and lower gasoline exports. Volumes decreased over $30 million quarter-over-quarter primarily due to reduced volumes resulting from a weaker power market, planned maintenance internationally and from Hurricane Isaac domestically. Other includes favorable foreign exchange impacts. Year-to-date MSO has generated earnings of over $500 million, which is in line with year-to-date earnings that we showed for 2011.","Slide 13 shows our per barrel metrics. Refining and Marketing\u2019s income per barrel improved this quarter to $6.37 per barrel with cash contributions of $7.21 per barrel. This now completes our review of the Refining and Marketing business segment.","Next, we\u2019ll move to the Midstream segment beginning on slide 14. Our Midstream segment was impacted this quarter by reduced equity earnings from DCP Midstream largely driven by depressed NGL prices as quarter-over-quarter prices were down 42%. Year-to-date, our annualized return on capital employed was 28%, down slightly from the high of 30% in 2011. We ended the quarter with $800 million in capital employed in our Midstream segment. As mentioned earlier, during the quarter, reported earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $133 million associated with the after-tax non-cash impairment of our equity investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline.","As we move to slide 15, Midstream's adjusted earnings of $56 million were comprised of $39 million in earnings associated with our interest in DCP Midstream, and $17 million from our other midstream businesses.","The next slide provides additional variance explanations for both DCP Midstream and other midstream earnings. As shown on the top portion of this slide, earnings associated with our interest in DCP Midstream decreased by $48 million this quarter, mainly due to DCP's exposure to NGL prices. This was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense that is attributable to an overall increase in the remaining useful lives of DCP's assets that was implemented last quarter. Our other midstream businesses were down $14 million driven in part due to inventory impacts.","Shifting now to discussion of our Chemicals segment, please turn to slide 17. Our Chemicals segment consists of our 50% equity interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company or CPChem. CPChem had another great quarter providing equity earnings of $275 million. CPChem achieved a 97% capacity utilization rate in its olefins and polyolefins segment allowing it to capture the cost advantages in the North American and Middle Eastern ethylene and derivatives markets. Year-to-date annualized after-tax return on capital employed for our Chemicals segment increased from 31%, and this is up from 28% last year and we ended the quarter with $3.6 billion in capital employed.","Special items for the quarter included a $122 million for losses associated with CPChem's early debt retirement and impairment of fixed assets, along with an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to the Phillips 66 spin from ConocoPhillips.","The next couple of slides provide more detail on the Chemicals segment earnings. Turning to slide 18, this quarter adjusted earnings increased by $82 million compared to the same period last year. The increase in earnings was primarily in olefins and polyolefins due to stronger chain margins. This was primarily attributed to reduce feedstock cost due to higher industry ethane inventories as well as continued strong demand for derivatives. Additionally, CPChem's operations continued to benefit from lower utility costs stemming from low natural gas prices.","Slide 19 provides additional details on CPChem's operating segments. In the top part of the chart, olefins and polyolefins generated equity earnings of $225 million in the third quarter. As previously mentioned, the $63 million was due primarily from higher olefins, polyolefins chain margins and lower utility costs as a result of reduced natural gas prices. Equity earnings from Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics increased by $4 million compared to the same period last year. This was mainly due to higher equity earnings from Saudi Chevron Phillips driven primarily by higher sales volumes and margins. This concludes our discussion of the financial and operating results for the quarter.","Next, I will provide you with some outlook items for the fourth quarter. As shown on slide 20, I want to start by providing an update on our Northeast operations, where we have the Bayway refinery located in Linden, New Jersey and three storage terminals in the New York, New Jersey area. As you know, Hurricane Sandy made landfall in the Northeast on Monday evening. Prior to the storm, we safely idled the refinery and shutdown the terminals as a precautionary measure. There was some flooding in low-lying areas of the refinery, but floodwaters have since receded, and as of this morning, power has been restored at Bayway. We are currently assessing the condition of the assets and a decision on resuming the operations will be made once this assessment is complete.","So, from an outlook perspective, for the fourth quarter, in Refining and Marketing, assuming Bayway is running, we expect our global utilization rate to be in the low 90s and our pre-tax turnaround expenses to be approximately $100 million. Scheduled maintenance, the scheduled maintenance turnarounds at the Wood River, Borger, and LA refineries are currently underway and are proceeding as planned with return to normal operations expected in November.","In Midstream, as we noted in our earnings release, we expect to acquire an interest in two NGL pipelines currently being constructed by DCP Midstream. And Tim will talk about this more later in his remarks. This investment will increase our total capital investments by an estimated $700 million to $800 million over the 2012 and 2013 time periods. Excluding the pipeline expenditures, total capital expense for the year is estimated at $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion.","In Chemicals distributions resumed in the fourth quarter after the completion of CPChem's debt repayment program. Corporate and other is expected to be a cost of about $40 million per month or approximately $120 million for the quarter and this includes after-tax net interest expense of about $50 million. In October, our Board of Directors declared a $0.25 per share dividend payable in the fourth quarter. This 25% dividend increase along with our $1 billion share repurchase plan is part of our strategy to return capital to our shareholders. We expect to complete the share repurchase program by the end of 2013.","We can now turn to slide 21, and I'll hand the call over to Tim Taylor to take you through an update on how we are advancing our strategic initiatives. Tim?","Tim Taylor - Executive Vice President, Commercial, Transportation, Business Development","Thanks, Greg. We continued to execute our strategy of enhancing returns, delivering growth, and increasing shareholder distributions. In Refining and Marketing, we are improving margins, enhancing returns by increasing runs, advantaged feedstocks and increasing refined product export capability. In order to supply higher quality, lower cost crude to our refineries, we are improving our logistics infrastructure and developing new sources of crude supply. For example, we are delivering 30,000 to 40,000 barrels per day of advantaged crude to our Bayway refinery by rail. We are also ramping up deliveries of locally produced Mississippian line crude into our Ponca City refinery via pipeline and truck.","We expect to receive up to an additional 50,000 barrels per day of this high-quality crude in the Ponca City by the end of 2013. We have also reached agreement with Kinder Morgan to deliver up to 30,000 barrels per day of Eagle Ford crude via a new pipeline connection to our Sweeny refinery in early 2014. All-in-all, by mid 2014, these actions along with others that we are taking are expected to increase our access to advantaged crudes by about 165,000 barrels per day across our domestic refining system. This represents about 9% of our U.S. refining capacity.","We also continued to increase clean product export capability through low-cost capital investments in order to meet growing international demand. As part of our ongoing portfolio optimization efforts, we have been evaluating the potential disposition of the 1.2-gigawatt Immingham Combined Heat and Power Plant in North Lincolnshire, England which is adjacent to our Humber refinery. The marketing period could last several months and we'll continue to operate the asset as usual during this period.","We remain committed to expanding the Midstream business as part of our strategy to deliver long-term profitable and valuable growth. We have reached agreement in principle to acquire a one-third ownership interest in DCP's Sand Hills and Southern Hills NGL pipelines representing a total estimated investment of approximately $700 million to $800 million. This investment will enable DCP to maintain its growth plan throughout the or through the 2015 time period and these pipelines strategically complement our Midstream and Chemicals businesses. The Sand Hills Pipeline is expected to commence deliveries of NGL from the Eagle Ford shale into Mont Belvieu by year end. DCP recently started the South Texas segment of its Sand Hills NGL pipeline, initially delivering 10,000 barrels per day of liquids from the Eagle Ford to the DCP Partners' Wilbreeze pipeline. The second phase was service from the Permian basin is targeted to be in operation by the second quarter of 2013. The Southern Hills Pipeline project which will extend from the mid-continent region to Mont Belvieu, Texas remains on schedule for completion in mid 2013.","In Chemicals, CPChem announced in October that the Saudi Polymers Company world-scale petrochemicals facility in Saudi Arabia began commercial production. CPChem's projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast are progressing as planned, including the proposed ethane cracker and related polyethylene facilities as well as their 1-hexene plant.","Finally, we'd like to remind you that we will be hosting our first Philips 66 Analyst Meeting in New York on December 13. We look forward to seeing you there or having you listen to our webcast. This completes our prepared remarks. We'll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) At this time, we have a question from Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning everyone. And congratulations on the earnings, and I obviously hope everyone at Bayway is safe. I guess a quick question. Firstly, you have got very strong free cash generation, so I guess our thoughts are going to turn to additional opportunities as well as distributions, and I am sure you are going to get lots of these questions at the Analyst Day, but can I ask you a question about returns? What sort of hurdle rates do you think are appropriate for say, volatile chemical cracking or NGL fractionation versus sort of longer term more stable logistics contracts?","Tim Taylor","I think when you \u2013 this is Tim Taylor, Ed. I think when you look at the Midstream and the fee-based kinds of projects we see returns in the low-double digits to mid-teens. As you think about the Chemicals space, we would plan in the 15 or higher kinds of returns for that and similar kinds of thoughts around the NGL expansions.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. And then when I am talking about the \u2013 obviously we can see a lot of logistics great potential in North America, but I guess I\u2019m less familiar with the potential in Chemicals, I mean you\u2019ve talked very clearly about the Gulf Coast ethane cracker. But I\u2019m just wondering could you give us some \u2013 any thoughts about other opportunities outside of that big project that you could potentially go for?","Tim Taylor","I think when you look at the chemicals business it\u2019s a global business and the investment thesis really for CPChem has been the focus on advantaged feedstocks. And so it\u2019s gone for Middle East in the early 2000s to really now strong positioning in North America. And so they continued to look at where they can have a competitive advantage in terms of project development on a global basis. So, I think initially still the Middle East, North America arrives to the top, but there is always an interest in Asia as well because of the growth in the market.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","And any opportunities further downstream or just stay pretty much upstream?","Tim Taylor","For downstream from ethylene\u2026","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah you mean\u2026","Tim Taylor","So, I think really the focus has been on the polyolefins and olefins and ethylene derivatives chain. And there are other options as you began look at other kinds of materials, we have strong presence in the aromatics businesses as well. But right now the biggest opportunities had been really in the olefins part of the chain.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Alright. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","","Congratulations on your result everybody.","Tim Taylor","Thanks, Doug.","Greg Maxwell","Thanks, Doug.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","So, you guys have been very optimistic on use of advantaged feedstock especially on the West Coast, mid-continent and the Gulf Coast too. And on this point I want to see whether or not you consider there to be significant opportunities on the West Coast as well and how you may be thinking about some of those options. And also on the West Coast some of your competitors appear to be reconsidering their desire is out participate in the California market, because of some of the costs maybe associated with the new regulatory plan. So, my question regards your strategic view of the West Coast market and whether you feel that the positions out there are sufficiently advantaged that they weren\u2019t continued participation and so just kind of a strategic update on that the position of West Coast as a whole as well?","Tim Taylor","Okay. Let me take those a little bit in terms of the market opportunity in the West Coast. They clearly \u2013 when we look at the West Coast it\u2019s been one of the more challenged markets from a recovery standpoint post recession. In California, specifically it\u2019s a tough regulatory environment as well, so costs are higher and there is a lot of potential additional cost as new regulations come into effect. That said it\u2019s still a very significant market and we think it\u2019s really important to look at how can we get some of these crudes out of the middle part of the country into the West Coast, particularly California.  So, we\u2019re working hard on that to try and change that Doug.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","Okay.","Tim Taylor","The comment I\u2019d make on Washington is that that\u2019s got a natural access to the Bakken and North Dakota and Canadian crudes.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","Okay.","Tim Taylor","And so I \u2013 we kind of separate I think the Washington piece from the California piece that way. But I think everyone is working hard to look at some crude solutions for the West Coast to improve its competitive position.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons","Good morning.","Greg Maxwell","Hi, Jeff.","Tim Taylor","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons","You mentioned the $250 million of feedstock advantages in the press release and I appreciate the comments also in your lead in on 30,000 to 40,000 barrels a day of Bayway rail. But I was hoping you could put that $250 million in perspective perhaps discuss which regions it\u2019s most impactful and what arbitrages you are capturing?","Tim Taylor","So, when we look at that it\u2019s a significant advantage this quarter. So, we kind of touched on the East Coast which is the Bayway with the ability to bring shale crude into Bayway it\u2019s got a great appetite for it. And the other plays that we are really seeing the change is in the Gulf Coast, where we are seeing the HLS, LLS, and the Brent relationships change and bringing in more domestic light-sweet crudes into that region as well. So, access and supply of domestic light into that region has improved its competitive position.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons","And is that primarily Eagle Ford crude going in to replace LLS, HLS?","Tim Taylor","So, that\u2019s Eagle Ford crude moving in from Texas is doing that as well. There is also going to be increasing amounts of WTI moving into that area as well.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons","Via rail?","Tim Taylor","Via rail today. And then obviously the pipeline logistics infrastructure is changing now with the Cushing to seaway reversal and Cushing connection.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons","Very well. Thanks for you comments.","Tim Taylor","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","First, good morning. I had a number of questions on the Sand Hills and Southern Hills, I guess I\u2019ll just rattle them off here altogether and maybe you could respond. For one, I am trying to understand the nature of the contract, can you remind me are they fee-based or POP? I am trying to understand or just confirm that it is indeed a one-third outright ownership of PSX outside of DCP, and if that is indeed the case, ultimately where do you see that ownership landing? Could it ultimately be moved to DCP? I know you are considering a new MLP potentially could it be moved there or do you see it just remaining in the PSX umbrella?","And then finally, on CapEx, I think I heard a $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, I am trying to understand, I thought that was roughly in the range of where we had previous guidance, obviously, this is an incremental investment. So, I am trying to make sure I understand the moving pieces of how CapEx is going to change as a result of this? Thanks.","Greg Maxwell","Yeah, Blake, good morning. This is Greg Maxwell. With regard to the nature of the contracts, still in process, but they are pushing more DCP Midstream pushing more towards fee-based contracts. The intent for DCP, their stated intent is to drop their one-third interest into a DPM and having fee-based contracts obviously is a very positive thing for an MLP. With regard to your, I may have spoken too fast with regard to the guidance, the guidance for capital expenditures for the year is in the $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion range, excluding the investment that we would make in Sand Hills and Southern Hills are one-third share. And we estimate that to be in the $700 million to $800 million range. With regard to the structure, we are still working on the structure. We currently anticipate that, that would \u2013 we would be acquiring a one-third interest in which it would be a JV-related structure, and so us, Spectra as well as DCP, at this time, would own a one-third interest in the JV structure.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay. And then just one more detailed follow-up if I could, just on the share count, I noticed it actually increased almost about 2.7 million shares or so quarter-to-quarter despite the buybacks. I am just trying to make sure I understand if there was anything we should be aware of going on there?","Greg Maxwell","It's two \u2013 sort of twofold really Blake. We purchased what turns out to be a little bit more ratably over the third quarter. So, from a weighted average perspective, you won't see the full impact of those purchased shares until we get into really the fourth quarter. On the flip side, the share issuance side, you saw that we lost little ground on a weighted average basis, but a lot of that was tied to the exercise of options from non \u2013 primarily from non-PSX or Phillips 66 employees as well as some additional issuances on our long-term stock savings plan. So, that should be more of a one-time event with regard to that. So, a very astute question, we think from an actual end of the quarter perspective, we basically on a basic share perspective stayed roughly even.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay, fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kate Minyard from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kate Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, good morning gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions.","Tim Taylor","Hi, Kate.","Kate Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi. I just wanted to ask a few questions on some of the comments that you have around the export capability and increasing that over time. You talked in the press release about increasing export capability through some low cost capital investments, and I guess my questions are first of all where do you see the opportunity as being the greatest whether geographically or product wise? And then what\u2019s the time horizon of this opportunity? So, in other words, how soon does Phillips 66 want to recover its capital and generate a return in order to justify these investments? And then finally how much more flexible is your current refining configuration, so what could you do without additional CapEx in the interim?","Tim Taylor","Yeah. So, we are actually doing a number of projects at our refineries that are located with access to water. And it makes particularly focused in Gulf Coast and West Coast and so these are typically kinds of pipeline connections, tankage those kind of things that can increase the rates for the availability to load export cargos. From an opportunity standpoint when we look at that it\u2019s really when you look at the Atlantic Basin specifically Latin America and West Africa that today have been the primary opportunities that have developed from standpoint and based on supply-demand balances going forward, we would expect that to continue.","Kate Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay.","Clayton Reasor","Did we answer all your questions? Okay, there was something else I think you would.","Kate Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Yeah. Well, is there a particular time horizon I mean you indicated that you think opportunity would continue, but is there sort of a time horizon, just kind of three year opportunity or do you see it as more extensive or would you like to recover your capital and return a little bit sooner than that?","Tim Taylor","Our target would be to go up to 220,000-230,000 barrels a day of export capability and we\u2019re looking to get that done by the end of next year. So, that\u2019s when we talk about low-cost short-term those are \u2013 these are relatively minor projects that we can execute quickly.","Kate Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Alright, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks. Good morning. I am wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on some of your \u2013 some of the remarks you made in your strategic initiatives section of your press release. You guys talked about how the PSX has recently entered into several transportation agreements and plans to improve targeted logistics infrastructure. Could you elaborate a little bit more what these several transportation agreements are and the duration of these agreements? And I have a follow-up after that. Thanks.","Tim Taylor","Faisel, we did talk about the connection to the Kinder Morgan crude condensate line that runs close to the Sweeny refinery. So, that\u2019s actually a project or a connector of pipeline that\u2019s relatively short that will be built by Kinder Morgan and so that\u2019s a throughput pipeline connection agreement we have specifically for that. Beyond that, we have talked in the last couple of months about our purchase of railcars to have a very flexible method of delivering these crudes in the developing plays into our refining system. So, there it\u2019s not only the investment in railcars, but it\u2019s also an investment in \u2013 around the infrastructure to unload railcars and to load those. And really when we look at our system it\u2019s the ability to unload the railcars when we think about infrastructure logistics that we\u2019re looking at, for instance at Bayway and other refineries as a way to increase the amount of rail that we can take into those various refineries. And so that\u2019s the capital side. And then you we\u2019ve got the commitments in terms from time to time with other third party kinds of logistics providers to make that happen as well.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay.","Greg Maxwell","Faisel, there are probably some other things that we are working on right now that we just \u2013 it will be premature for us to disclose because those contracts haven\u2019t been finalized or the agreements with our counterparties haven\u2019t been flanged up, so there is a lot of work that\u2019s going on in this area. You should expect hearing more as time goes forward. And Tim I don\u2019t know if you want to\u2026","Tim Taylor","No. Yeah, there is a lot of pipeline expansion and opportunities there and we\u2019re just making sure that we\u2019re looking at all those opportunities.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, understood. And can you talk a little bit more about \u2013 I believe you said there is a major maintenance going on or a turnaround is going on at Wood River, I think you said Ponca and Borger but I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on that in terms of what those turnarounds are and what you guys are doing at the \u2013 in your mid-continent portfolio?","Tim Taylor","So, Wood River and Borger are both in turnarounds today. We expect those back in operation here in November. And those are major turnarounds. Borger is a very significant one. We do have some operations continuing at Wood River today. So, those are plant turnarounds that we've had and we got smaller turnarounds going on at LA that have some minor impacts in terms of its throughput.","Greg Maxwell","I think we talked about what $100 million in turnaround expenses.","Tim Taylor","Right.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, great. And last question from me, the 30,000 to 40,000 barrels a day of advantaged crude that you guys consumed at Bayway, is there anyway give us idea of what the cost of getting that crude into the refinery was, what was the advantage of bringing in that crude versus taking a West African barrel, was it a $3 advantage, $5 advantage what was the real crude advantage you guys realized into Bayway from that strategy?","Tim Taylor","I think you\u2019re going to appreciate that prices move around, but on average we would use $2 to $3 a barrel.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Great, thank you very much. I appreciate your time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","","Thanks. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Tim Taylor","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Hi, I have got one strategic I guess and one maybe couple of housekeeping ones. As you look at the Gulf Coast you talked in your remarks about how you started to see Louisiana light I guess see some benefit relative to imported light sweet crude like Brent for example. We\u2019ve obviously been noticing that as well as and curious as to whether you can us your prognosis as to how this is likely to play our how you\u2019ll react to it in terms of your ability to ramp up you light sweet crude barrels and maybe substitute your light-sweet crude barrels. I\u2019ll stop with that one and of course a couple of housekeeping ones please.","Tim Taylor","Yeah, Doug, this is a continuing story and we\u2019ve seen the imports of offshore light sweet diminished particularly in the Gulf Coast. And so I think all of us in that area are looking at that, we\u2019ve very active in this area. So, the increasing supply of these light crudes out of the U.S. ultimately we believe that will displace that waterborne barrel into particularly the Gulf Coast. So, I think our view is that when that happens, that puts additional pressure on the LLS price to be competitive. So, I think that we would continue to expect that there could perhaps be some additional widening on the Brent LLS spread.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Do, you think what we\u2019re seeing right now is indicative this has already started to happen?","Tim Taylor","I believe it has started to happen, yes.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Okay, have you guys taken any sort of base line shipping commitments on the seaway expansion?","Tim Taylor","I don\u2019t, I\u2019m not sure, we have if and we did we probably wouldn\u2019t\u2026","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Right, okay, fair enough. The housekeeping one, just real quick the inventory gain Clayton I think that\u2019s included in the gross margins. Can you break it up by region as to where that gain was realized?","Clayton Reasor","So, you\u2019re talking about $100 million difference?","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Right, year-over-year.","Clayton Reasor","Do we have that Greg or\u2026","Greg Maxwell","As far as the split, most of that was in the Gulf region and into the East Atlantic basin area as I recall.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Got it\u2026","Clayton Reasor","Doug, the single largest variance was in the Atlantic Basin are of the $100 million.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Got it. That\u2019s kind of what I was expecting. And I guess the final one I don\u2019t know if you can give us this or not, but it looks to us following the (indiscernible) results yesterday and yours today, it looks like the European side of the Atlantic Basin was very strong. Is there anyway you could give us some kind of indicative split as to how the earnings split between the U.S. and the international piece of that and I\u2019ll leave with that.","Clayton Reasor","Let\u2019s see we may have something, can you take that Greg?","Greg Maxwell","I think we\u2019ll have to get that for you.","","Clayton Reasor","We\u2019ll have \u2013 we can, I would just say the European refineries when you look at the third quarter that was their best quarter of the year. I think Whitegate, Miro and Humber all had good quarters but Bayway did as well. I\u2019ll say most of change probably comes from an improvement in earnings out of Europe rather than improvement in Bayway.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","It\u2019s really helpful. Alright guys. Thanks your time.","Clayton Reasor","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","","Hey guys.","Clayton Reasor","Good morning.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Hopefully, I just have a number of quick questions. Greg, can you share with us that in general what is your insurance policy in terms of BI and property damage?","Greg Maxwell","Yeah, you\u2019re probably talking with \u2013 specifically with the Bayway incident and the terminal I guess Paul\u2026","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","That\u2019s correct.","Greg Maxwell","From a perspective of that, that falls under name windstorm coverage. And as a result, other than a smaller piece in our participation in (Ohio), we do not have any commercial insurance associated with named windstorm coverage. So, as a result, we are basically self-funded.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Okay. So \u2013 and do you have any BI, business interruption insurance or not really?","Greg Maxwell","Yes. We do carry BI insurance, but as you are probably aware, you have to actually take out named windstorm coverage in order to get that associated with any hurricane activity. So, as a result, given the pricing as well as our view of the overall total impact that a hurricane or a named windstorm could have on our operations, we elected not to take out that coverage.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Okay. So, your second question, Greg, if we assume that the Saudi Arabia chemical plant, the Polymer plant actually was on stream before the third quarter, based on the market condition there, what would the earnings contribution to you guys would be?","Greg Maxwell","You're talking about SPCo startup?","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","That's correct.","Greg Maxwell","I think it actually started up in October.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Right. I was saying that if we assume that it is actually a pro forma there, it actually run in the third quarter, what type of earning contribution you may have, I mean, do you guys have a number you can share?","Tim Taylor","Sure. I think it's clearly in the ramp-up phase of their operations today, but I think in longer term, I might say steady state basis. We'd kind of look at that to be 10% or so of the CPChem contribution.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Okay. And Greg, can I have some quick balance sheet data, what is your working capital market value of inventory in excess of the bulk and of the total debt, how much is of them that you see in the long-term debt?","Greg Maxwell","With regard to the replacement cost in (Technical Difficulty)","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","In the third quarter, probably second to third quarter, do we have that increase or that they have already been running at that rate?","Tim Taylor","They have increased, Paul, I can't remember the exact increase, but we are increasing that. And as you can guess, we are continuing to so to speak test the limits and we can go substantially higher. So, I think the challenge for us is to continue to work logistics and get more and more of that into the Bayway refinery.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Do you have a number that how much is the increase on the WTI link including the Eagle Ford crude runs sequentially from second to third quarter in the Gulf Coast?","Greg Maxwell","Gulf Coast crude run changes. I had to see if I can get back, it did increase, Alliance was down, so the percentages as a percent of total it impacted that somewhat so\u2026","Clayton Reasor","Probably, it did not go up because Alliance was down for two or three weeks.","Greg Maxwell","Right.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","I see. And then in earlier comment, are you saying for Bayway, the up that you realize is about say in the $2 range, do you have a similar number for the Gulf Coast?","Clayton Reasor","Uplift relative to West Africa and North Sea crudes.","Greg Maxwell","I think it really, it's still driven off the LLS, the HLS, (Alliance) and so it's probably in the same order of magnitude right now in that area as well.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","I see. A two final one, one of your competitor is voicing concern about the California market also our long-term future given the regulatory environment, I want to see that what is the view of PSX in terms of California is that still considered as a core market for you guys or that you guys also have your own doubt. Second one, I think maybe is for Greg on dividend you guys have a nice increase 25%, but your payout is still extremely low and that your yield is about 2.1% certainly lower than some of your peers and just want to understand in terms of the criteria and also the timeline on how the board will determine in terms of when or by how much that \u2013 what kind of criteria they need to see in order for them to raising a more significant way on the regular dividend given that I think a lot of your long-only account investor may probably quite appreciate a higher dividend yield.","Greg Maxwell","Paul I\u2019ll address the market question on California. As I said a little bit earlier I think we look at the market and say demand continues to struggle out there as well post-recession and then I think you look more fundamentally at the operating environment and the costs associated with the particularly the environmental regulations and we think that\u2019s going to continue to keep pressure on operations in operating costs out there. So, yeah I\u2019d say that from a California perspective that it is one of the more challenged parts of our portfolio in terms of the basic value equation. So, that\u2019s why we\u2019re still looking at the crude side of it and continuing to stay abreast and then top of what\u2019s going to take to comply the things like AB32 to really maintain your operations out there.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","But Tim, you still view it as a part of your core portfolio or that you may have doubts?","Tim Taylor","In the past California has been a really good in the marketed times, but right now it is our lower performing. So, I think that if our assessment would become that it\u2019s going to be challenged for some period of time, we\u2019d either go to find the way to improve that operation or function of the way to deal with that.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Okay","Tim Taylor","Greg, do you want to?","Greg Maxwell","Sure, on the dividend question Paul it\u2019s something that we always look at. And I think that\u2019s evidenced by our 25% increase. Our objective is to go to have a dividend that is competitive. We wanted to be also affordable and we also wanted to grow over time I thank Greg Garland our Chairman his view is he wants to look 10 years down the road in the rearview mirror and say every single year he has a history of 66 increasing our dividend. Having said that we also recognized that we\u2019re in a highly cyclical business and as such one of the one of the ways we\u2019d try complementing returning value back to the shareholders is through our share repurchase program. That gives us some opportunity to basically create a swing \u2013 a variable swing in the event that we hit the low point of cycle then we\u2019re able to maybe pull back a bit on that if our cash requirements required it. So, I think from a guidance perspective the intent is for us to look at and get in a pattern of an annual view of our dividend increases and probably take an assessment and raise the dividends if appropriate on an annual basis.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Thank you.","Tim Taylor","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, we have a question from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hey, good morning guys. Great results.","Tim Taylor","Hey, Evan. Thank you.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah, I have a quick follow-up and then a different question on utilization levels, but how much LLS are you running today and that's not currently considered advantage crude in your 63% calculation?","Greg Maxwell","So, that's primarily\u2026.","Tim Taylor","Primarily, Alliance. So, the LLS, HLS, or Alliance it's the predominant part of our crude runs at that facility.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Just \u2013 and then a different question, on your aggregate, refining utilizations are high 96% with some downtime at Alliance. I mean, I know that various clean fuel regulations have lowered max utilization from historic highs and runs are dependent upon a feed slate. And is that close to your theoretic maximum or could you kind of walk us through your four regions and tell me where you think they could actually run if they had the right incentive to run?","Greg Maxwell","So, I think that we are seeing in the mid-continent, in the Central Corridor. When I look at that, that we have actually seen sustained runs now creeping up a bit, and I think it does speak to consistency to crude slate in some of the mid-continent operations and continuing improvements in our joint venture refinery at Wood River. So, we have seen that there. Bayway has run very well with processed inputs. So, it's not only just crude runs, but additional input as well on in terms of rolling out the units. So, probably I look at the Central Corridor and say we pretty much ran it about as much as we could. We like to get more, because it's got a great margin today. The California refineries, West Coast were again close to their capacity as well. I would say, that's pretty much it for them. And in the Gulf Cost with Alliance is probably our biggest opportunity after the hurricane and the impacts of that to come on back up to full rates. So, we look around our system, the Atlantic Basin and Europe we are right there, the Central Corridor, so that's the only place, where we didn't run pretty close to capacity would be the Gulf Coast. And then I think that's just a matter of getting Alliance line back out.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","And what would full be for the Gulf? Would it be in the high 90s?","Greg Maxwell","Yeah, yeah. I think we look at that 95% and above as pretty high capacity utilization.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. And just maybe one last question if I could, I know it's been \u2013 look MLPs have been a real defining element of this cycle, inclusion of more and more cyclical assets have grown in popularity as well as IRS permissibility and valuation in the market. I mean, can you discuss maybe how your consideration has changed or how you think about the suitability of that structure for either refining assets or in ethane cracking assets, where I know you have a partner that would have equal say but how do you think about the suitability of the structure for those assets actually?","Tim Taylor","Well, I think we certainly see the value that can be created from an MLP. As Greg talked about earlier with fee-based kinds of assets or our transportation logistics assets, we look at that and we say okay we see the value creation. It's got some other challenges so to speak when you did the MLP structure in terms of dilutive to ROCE, dilutive to earnings. And so that's kind of the contribution. It can be depending on how you view it relatively expensive from a financial structure. So, that's part of our deliberation and really where we are focused is on that transportation logistics piece with PSX. The variable MLP is pretty early. We'll wait and see. It's great time right now to have those with distributions, but clearly, they are variable. And I think it will be interesting to see how that works out with the test of time, and I can say that in the petrochemicals side, we really don't have any plans to look at that from a cracking standpoint.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Understood. Thanks guys.","Tim Taylor","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we have a question from Cory Garcia from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Cory Garcia \u2013 Raymond James","Thanks. Good morning fellows. A great quarter. I was just hoping that kind of in the petrochem theme, would you guys be able to provide a bit more color into the demand trends you guys are seeing in terms of your polyolefin business, clearly the U.S. trends seem a lot stronger than what we are seeing in Europe and elsewhere, but anymore color you guys could have in terms of Asia, Latin America? And then also refresh me on the, I guess the amount of exports you guys actually participate in sort of that market?","Tim Taylor","Okay. So, we kind of break that, when we look around the world, I would say a great place to be today is in the United States. The demand has been relatively stable. It\u2019s still not what I would call robust, but clearly with the operating rates you are seeing, a great place to be at. I think it speaks to the advantaged feedstock that we have here as well as probably a decent demand from the industrial and manufacturing sector. Europe is weak when we look across the globe. Asia has backed off substantially from what you would have thought a year ago, and frankly part of that stems from the weakness in Europe, because they are still heavily dependent upon trade for their manufacturing. So, I don\u2019t think there is anything surprising there, except that perhaps we look at the base U.S. and say it\u2019s a pretty good market. Latin America is still relatively small, but does okay as well.","And then when we think about the export piece that does provide some underpinning if you will for the petrochemical business in the U.S. And so I think as an industry, I still think about it in the 20%, 25% range of petrochemicals being able to be exported or you can do that. So, a lot of optionality there that develops when you got that kind of cost position. The other thing I\u2019d say on CPChem is it\u2019s important to realize that, if you think about their production base in Middle East and their production base in the United States positioned well in the lower \u2013 two lowest cost areas in the world in petrochemicals and I think that shows up in the strength of their earnings.","Cory Garcia \u2013 Raymond James","Absolutely. Yeah I appreciate your time guys.","Tim Taylor","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the time that we have for questions and now I will turn the call back to Clayton Reasor for closing remarks.","Clayton Reasor - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Affairs","","Well, thank you again for the participation interest in the company. You can find a copy of the transcript from the call on our website and we look forward to talking with you all soon. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Rosy Zuklic, General Manager, Investor Relations. Rosy, you may begin.","Rosy Zuklic - Phillips 66 Partners LP","Thank you, Sally. Good morning and welcome to the Phillips 66 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; Tim Taylor, President; and Kevin Mitchell, Executive Vice President and CFO.","The presentation material we will be using during the call can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide two contains our Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our question-and-answer session.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our filings with the SEC.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg Garland for some opening remarks. Greg?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Thanks, Rosy. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.","Total adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $83 million or $0.16 per share. Market conditions continued to be challenging as Refining, Marketing and Chemicals margins were all lower. We also had significant turnarounds during the quarter. These factors contributed to our disappointing earnings. For the full year, 2016 adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion or $2.82 per share. We operated well and continued to execute on our projects and we maintained financial strength and flexibility while continuing to return significant capital to our shareholders.","We believe that operational excellence is fundamental for generating and protecting shareholder value. 2016 was our safest year ever and we ran our refineries at 96% utilization, which was a record for our company. Our Marketing & Specialties business also delivered solid results for the year and achieved record volumes. We managed costs well across our organization, holding controllable costs flat despite our significant growth activities.","We reached several milestones in our Midstream growth program in 2016. At Freeport, we completed our 150,000 barrel per day LPG Export Terminal, commissioning went smoothly and the facility is operating as designed. We shipped our first commercial cargo in mid-December and we expect the facility to be loading to near capacity this month. The Dakota Access ETCOP system is expected to complete in the second quarter. Phillips 66 has a 25% interest in these projects.","In the Gulf Coast, the Beaumont Terminal expansion is ongoing. We commissioned 1.2 million barrels of contracted crude storage in the fourth quarter and 2 million barrels of additional crude and product storage is expected to be available by mid-year. We have plans to ultimately expand this facility to 16 million barrels.","Phillips 66 Partners remains an important part of our Midstream growth strategy. In 2016, the partnership raised more than $2 billion in debt at equity capital markets, which it used to grow its business by acquiring assets and developing organic projects. During the fourth quarter, we completed our largest dropdown to date contributing $1.3 billion of logistics assets to PSXP. The partnership remains on pace to achieve its growth objective of having $1.1 billion in run rate EBITDA by the end of 2018.","At the start of this year, DCP Midstream contributed its assets and existing debt to its MLP, simplifying the organizational structure, increasing its ownership as a publicly traded partnership. This transaction should enable better capital allocation, position DCP for growth and allow for increased cash distribution to its owners.","In Chemicals, CPChem is advancing the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. The polyethylene units are on track to start up in mid-2017 and the ethane cracker in the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect to see increased distributions from CPChem starting this year as capital spending is reduced following the completion of the project.","In Refining, we continue to pursue high return quick payoff projects. At the Billings Refinery, we're increasing Canadian heavy crude processing capability to 100%. This project is expected to be complete in the first half of this year. At the Bayway and Wood River refineries, we're modernizing the FCCs to increase clean product yield. Both projects are expected to be completed in the first half of 2018.","During 2016, we generated approximately $5 billion in cash from operations and dropdown proceeds from PSXP. This enabled us to fund $2.8 billion of capital expenditures and return $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We remain committed to our strategy, executing our growth plans, enhancing returns and rewarding our shareholders. The projects we have coming online are well-positioned to increase cash flow. In 2017, we expect to increase our dividend again and to spend $1 billion to $2 billion on share repurchases. We believe our portfolio remains a differentiating factor that provides upside in a rising U.S. production environment.","With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin to go through the quarter results.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone.","Starting on slide four, fourth quarter earnings were $163 million. We had several special items that netted to a benefit of $80 million. Included in these special items were several tax adjustments across our businesses that benefited earnings. These were partially offset by railcar lease termination costs in Refining and a charge related to the DCP restructuring in Midstream. After removing these items, adjusted earnings were $83 million or $0.16 per share.","Cash from operations for the quarter was $667 million and included a $31 million working capital benefit. In addition, PSXP raised approximately $1.1 billion from the issuance of long-term notes during the fourth quarter.","Capital spending for the quarter was $813 million, with $452 million spent on growth, mostly in Midstream. Distributions to shareholders in the fourth quarter totaled $558 million, including $328 million in dividends and $230 million in share repurchases.","Our adjusted effective income tax rate was negative 11%, due in large part to the mix of losses in our U.S. operations and gains in our European businesses.","Slide five compares fourth quarter and third quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were down by $473 million, driven by decreases across all of the segments. There were several factors impacting the fourth quarter's results compared with the third quarter beyond normal market sensitivities. DCP had higher integrity and maintenance spending. In addition, higher NGL prices were partially offset by DCP's hedging activities to reduce its exposure to market price volatility. Together, these items lowered fourth quarter Midstream adjusted earnings by approximately $20 million relative to sensitivities.","In Refining, the impact of pricing of products shipped on certain Gulf Coast pipelines reduced adjusted earnings by about $50 million compared with monthly average prices assumed in the 3:2:1 market crack. Additionally, the West Coast was significantly impacted by major turnaround activity at the Los Angeles refinery. And Refining and Marketing & Specialties were both affected by lower margins from our commercial activities, which moved results away from market indicators, as well as impacts from hedges on discretionary inventory. Together, these items lowered Refining and Marketing & Specialties adjusted earnings by approximately $75 million in aggregate relative to sensitivities.","I'll now cover each of the segments individually. I'll start with Midstream on slide six. After removing non-controlling interest of $36 million, Midstream's fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $33 million, $42 million lower than the third quarter. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter were $44 million, down $19 million from the prior quarter, driven by an increase in non-controlling interest related to the October dropdown of assets to PSXP and lower equity earnings from Rockies Express Pipeline due to the third quarter receipt of a $10 million settlement net to us.","In NGL, we had an adjusted loss of $5 million for the quarter. This represented an $8 million decrease from the prior quarter, and was largely driven by higher expenses associated with placing the Freeport LPG terminal into service. Our adjusted loss associated with DCP Midstream was $6 million in the fourth quarter, a $15 million decrease compared to the previous quarter. This was primarily due to higher reliability and maintenance spending and lower equity earnings.","Turning to Chemicals on slide seven, fourth quarter adjusted earnings for the segment were $124 million, $66 million lower than the third quarter. In Olefins and Polyolefins, adjusted earnings decreased by $60 million from the prior quarter, driven largely by lower margins and turnaround activities at Cedar Bayou and one of CPChem's joint ventures. Global O&P utilization was 86%, 7% lower than the prior quarter and in line with guidance. Adjusted earnings for SA&S decreased by $7 million on lower aromatics margins as well as lower equity earnings.","In Refining, crude utilization was 93% for the quarter, in line with guidance. Clean product yield was 86%, our highest ever. The higher clean product yield was partially due to the sale of the Whitegate refinery and increased butane blending during the quarter. Pre-tax turnaround costs were $205 million. Realized margin was $6.47 per barrel, $0.76 lower than in the third quarter.","The chart on slide eight provides a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. In total, the Refining segment had an adjusted loss of $95 million, down $229 million from last quarter. Regionally, the Atlantic Basin had capacity utilization of 102% and saw higher earnings in the fourth quarter, reflecting improved market cracks. The other regions were all impacted by lower margins.","The Gulf Coast clean product realizations were negatively impacted by the rise in prices relative to the timing of shipments during the quarter. Margins were down in the Central Corridor, where the market crack fell $3.62 per barrel. In the West Coast region, the Los Angeles refinery ran significantly below capacity during October and November. This contributed to our 71% regional crude capacity utilization and higher costs versus the third quarter. West Coast capture was also hurt by product differentials between the benchmark Los Angeles market and other West Coast markets.","Next we will cover market capture on slide nine. The 3:2:1 market crack for the quarter was $12.10 per barrel, down from $12.96 in the third quarter. Our realized margin for the fourth quarter was $6.47 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 53%, down slightly from 56% in the prior quarter.","Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries and our production relative to the market crack calculation. With 86% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. Losses from Secondary Products of $2.69 per barrel were $0.25 per barrel improved this quarter despite rising crude costs, as NGL prices increased more than crude.","Feedstock advantage was $0.45 per barrel higher than the third quarter. The Other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials, and inventory impacts. This category was $1.36 per barrel worse than the third quarter, due in part to lower product differentials.","Let's move to Marketing & Specialties on slide 10. Adjusted earnings for M&S in the fourth quarter were $140 million, down $127 million from the third quarter. In Marketing and Other, the $114 million decrease in adjusted earnings was largely due to lower domestic and international realized marketing margins, reflecting the impact of seasonality and rising product prices. Specialties adjusted earnings decreased by $13 million, primarily as a result of seasonally lower lubricants volumes and costs associated with a brand refresh.","On slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted after-tax net costs of $119 million this quarter compared to $110 million in the third quarter. The increase in net costs reflects higher interest expense due to the October bond offering by Phillips 66 Partners and lower capitalized interest from placing the Freeport LPG Export Terminal into service, as well as higher environmental costs.","On slide 12 we summarize our financial results for the year. 2016 adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion or $2.82 per share. At the end of the fourth quarter, our debt to capital ratio was 30% and our net debt to capital ratio was 24%. The adjusted return on capital employed for 2016 was 5%.","Slide 13 shows full-year cash flow. We began 2016 with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations for the year was $2.5 billion. Working capital increased cash flow by $500 million. Phillips 66 Partners raised approximately $1 billion in public equity offerings and $1.3 billion in debt. We funded $2.8 billion of capital expenditures and investments, including third-party acquisitions like PSXP that totaled approximately $260 million.","We distributed $2.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the fourth quarter with 519 million shares outstanding. On the cash flow chart, included in the Other category, are advances to equity affiliates and distributions to PSXP LP unit holders. At the end of December, our cash balance stood at $2.7 billion.","This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next I'll cover a few outlook items. In the first quarter, in Chemicals we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the high 80s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low 80s and before tax turnaround expenses to be between $300 million and $350 million as this is expected to be a heavy turnaround quarter for us.","We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $125 million and $140 million after-tax. For 2017, we expect full year turnaround expenses to be between $625 million and $675 million pre-tax. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $490 million and $510 million. We expect full year D&A of about $1.3 billion, and company-wide we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s.","With that, we'll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning, everybody. Thank you.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Hi, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Could you update us \u2013 hi, guys. Could you update us on the contribution that the Freeport LPG Export Terminal made in Q4? I assume it was nothing, if not negative. And what the anticipated contribution EBITDA-wise is for this coming year or this current year of 2017? And can you do the same for the crude storage that you added? And finally, could you just update us on the very latest on how the petrochemical, major Petrochemical Project is going on the Gulf Coast? Thanks.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Okay. So I think look, on the LPG export facility, we premised eight cargoes a month. I think we did about $5.5 million.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Correct.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","In December.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yeah.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","So we essentially had a full quarter worth of cost, which is somewhere around $12 million-ish I guess. So we probably did not offset the cost with the cargoes during the fourth quarter. As you look into the first quarter, January we did eight cargoes. I think we have the same laid in for February and March. And so I think that as you think about that project, we've never really broken down what the export facility is going to be. We've said the total Sweeny Hub, which is the frac, LPG export, caverns, et cetera is $400 million to $500 million of EBITDA. And we've said there's about $200 million or so of arb in there. So that leaves you, kind of, $300 million-ish.","The frac's up and running. And that's somewhere $65 million to $70 million of EBITDA. That leaves you the balance with what it will be in LPG export facility. I will say we premised $0.12 in the economics for the fee across the dock, Paul. And we have some contracts above that and some below that. And then we're doing at least two to three cargos a month of spot. And the spot is about 70% of what we premised. So I think that kind of covers. Tim's acting like he wants to come in.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","I'd just say that on the volume side, it's been strong demand. We're seeing good pull out of Asia. Good demand out of Europe as well as some demand out of Latin America. And so heating season in the northern hemisphere has been a pull. And then petrochemical demand has been good as well. So I think the good news is on the volume side. And we'll see where the arbs go. But I think we started up very smoothly. Got it loaded. Now we've got to work on optimization of that value.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you. And the very latest on the Gulf Coast?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","On the petrochemical side, the two projects, really. At Sweeny we've got the derivative units in polyethylene. And those are coming up midyear. So it's on target just as we expected, so we're in the commissioning phases and those kinds of things now.","The ethane cracker is fourth quarter is how we look at the completion, so behind in terms of where they are, but still feeling with the contract interventions we've made, additional l resources that that project is holding well for the end of the year. And so you get a partial value uplift with the polyethylene startup in the summer. And then you really move into where the full value uplift though, will really come in 2018 as the cracker really comes online at that point.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Understood. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, Rosy.","Rosy Zuklic - Phillips 66 Partners LP","Thanks. Bye.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Dietert with Simmons. Your line is open.","Jeff A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Good morning.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Hey, Jeff.","Jeff A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Phillips 66's leverage to NGLs through the Sweeny Hub and NGL pipeline enters fractionators and the LPG export facility. NGL production has really held up better than oil or natural gas production, which fell with the reduced activity last year. Would you discuss your outlook for NGLs with the relatively strong performance on the production side? And what opportunities you might see for additional infrastructure?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I'll start high level then Tim can come in. I think that we're quite pleased by the way the NGL volumes held up in 2016. Our view is rig count is going up, bottomed in somewhere just over 300, up over 500 rigs to increasing activity, particularly coming out of the Permian, I think that bodes well for NGLs. As you know we have an expansion announced at our Sand Hills line, from 285 to at least 350, maybe a little more than that. But high interest, I would say, from producers in moving their liquids to market. So we're","interested in that.","In our capital budget this year, towards the end of the year, we have laid in plans to FID Frac Two. We're in, I would say, very serious discussions on the volumes for that frac. And I think we're feeling pretty good about that at this point in time. So I think we see an increasing need for infrastructure around the NGL side of it. Our plan was always to not stop with Frac One in Sweeny, but do Frac Two and Frac Three at Sweeny. So I think we start laying in those plans as we see increased opportunities for infrastructure development around what we view is going be an increasing NGL environment.","I think I'd just say, and Tim can probably talk to this too a little bit more, crude prices are certainly recovered. NGL prices have been on a rip here in the last quarter I would say, certainly towards the first part of this year also.","But we think that the arbs tend to open back up. We think with increased production, we're not going to have enough demand in the U.S. to clear either the heating markets or petrochemical markets and you're going have to export. So we do think that arbs do open up in, certainly in 2017, but particularly the back half of 2017.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Just a couple comments, Jeff, on that. First of all, as the cracker start-up, the ethane comes out of rejection back down the pipe, so you've got a natural load on both fractionators as well as the pipe. So I think that's a direct upside to both the DCP and PSXP and PSX.","And then as Greg mentioned, the industry is running very light right now in ethane because they're strongly favored in the petrochemical crack. So the propane is really pulled with both the heating demand here and then some good demand out of those export markets. And as we look out, the balance is \u2013 we still feel very confident butane, propane and now ethane even needs to balance to the export markets in the future. So we think that continues to be a structurally a very good play.","Jeff A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International","With the real strength, almost spiking prices in propane and butane, it obviously helps frac margins, but with butane, it's typically a winter grade gasoline component, and how is that influencing gasoline production and gasoline margins?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","We saw it in the fourth quarter in our system, we're up actually about two points on clean product yield, and a lot of that is due directly to butane blending in our system. That's going to wind down, but that certainly underpinned the butane price in the short-term was that that play into the gasoline pool. Our expectation is that it's seasonal and that begins to come off as we get into the summer season. You make summer grade gasoline, you can't blend as much butane in it.","Jeff A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Thanks for your comments.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Thanks, Jeff.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I'm on mute, sorry. Good morning.","Rosy Zuklic - Phillips 66 Partners LP","Good morning.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Hi, Ed.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That was a great question I just asked. I've forgotten it now.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Well, we gave a great answer, too, Ed, so.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. So just on Chemicals, as you, obviously, start up the downstream plant and then the cracker, you're going to get OpEx costs, some you can capitalize. Maybe just walk through a little bit about how we should think about how this is going to hit earnings, and then, obviously, distributions in, perhaps, a little bit more detail as we go through the quarters here and into 2018.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","As you start up, you've obviously got now to the extent that you've got loading up in the operations side when your start up, that will actually begin to hit, and so you need the production to offset that. So you've got a couple of months where you'll see that and before you get the contribution on the margin. So as you go, you should \u2013 on the Chemicals side, you would expect in the summer the increase in the OpEx at the \u2013 running rate. The units then will contribute to the earnings, and so you see that.","We think that's a relatively smaller piece of the total project because the margins on the polyethylene, with purchased ethylene or the ethylene upgrade is relatively small. As you get to the fourth quarter, you'll see those start-up expenses and stuff on the cracker, those are larger. And then as you get into the first quarter of 2018 on that, if the start-up occurs in the fourth quarter, you begin to see the earnings. So I think you've got exposure, higher expenses without full coverage on the earnings side during that startup period. But normally that's a relatively short period of time, a month or two.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then on the distribution side because the CapEx will be coming down as the project comes closer to closing out.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","I really think that the CapEx is the big driver. And so you're on the part now where compared to last year, it's down significantly. And so I think we need to complete the project. The owners will look at that, but we're still thinking that the operating rate and the margin environment in Chemicals will be pretty constructive this year. So we're thinking that there's a good chance that we should be able to begin to see the CapEx, so to speak, that's not there available for distribution, say that's $1 billion or so roughly.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yeah.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","And then in 2018, you then get the earnings contribution which would then add additional distribution. And so we take 50% of that, Ed. But the CapEx is certainly going to be there this year. I just think it's a good time to make sure that we cover that expenditure from the project side as owners.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then on the DCP, the simplification or the change in structure, maybe just walk through a little bit about how that's going to affect cash distributions back to PSX. And some people still think that the debt burden is still too high, so maybe some comments on your opinion there given that there is an exciting growth opportunity in that asset for the upstream producers in the Permian.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yeah, Ed, this is Kevin. So as you think about the new structure, at the entity up-top, which is where us and Spectra have the 50%-50% ownership, all you have there now are the LP and GP interests, which attract the LP distributions and the IDRs that come with that. There's some debt. There's about $400 million of debt there. So the debt service expense and then those distributions coming up. So what that means is we should see a path to distributions back out to the owners much sooner than we would have previously. So we would expect to see cash coming out in 2017.","As you know, through that restructuring, we've put in place some conditional IDR givebacks if needed at the MLP level but with the way the markets have gone and NGL prices, that doesn't look so likely that would be needed in the current environment. So we do expect we'll start seeing cash coming back to the owners this year.","From a standpoint of growth, with the simplification, clearly any growth activities will take place at the MLP. And so they need to look at their overall capital structure, cost of capital from a standpoint of the ability to issue debt and equity. Clearly with the leverage that's there at this point in time, that you wouldn't expect to see debt being issued without some equity as well because they're kind of at the high end of the range from a leverage standpoint. But the encouraging news is they're seeing opportunities as well. So the growth opportunities are starting to surface again and they announced a little bit of that at the time of the restructuring.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, everybody. Good morning.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Guys, there was obviously an awful lot of moving parts in the quarter especially with the start-up costs. So I wonder if I could ask one of the other questions slightly differently. To the extent you can, is it possible to quantify what the, I guess, the combination of opportunity costs and sort of one-offs start-up events, if that hadn't been there, what would have \u2013 what was the sort of EBITDA loss to those issues that on a normalized quarter would not normally have been there? I don't know if that's something you'd be able to quantify.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Doug, this is Kevin. The items that I ran through that were the kind of outside of the normal market sensitivities. So on DCP that was about $20 million. And these are net income effect, right. So not EBITDA. You'd have to gross up for an EBITDA equivalent. So $20 million on DCP between the integrity maintenance spending and the impact of the hedges. And the refining, the effect of the realized \u2013 the product differentials about $50 million. And then the commercial activities, including some of the hedges on discretionary inventory, about $75 million. So if you add those up, you're at $145 million of kind of out of the ordinary items that are pretty difficult to model without having all the detail in front of you.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess, I was thinking more about startup costs and the opportunity costs of having downtime in West Coast, those kind of issues as opposed to what you called out, Kevin. Is it \u2013 can you put some numbers around that or not?","Rosy Zuklic - Phillips 66 Partners LP","Hey, Doug. This is Rosy. What I was going to say for the West Coast, you could probably just think about the L.A. refinery, which was the one where we had the significant downtime. And that was the vast majority of our turnaround expense. So we had about $205 million of turnaround, so call it $100 million. The other thing that was happening there is L.A. was down in month of October completely and in half of the month of November, and all in for the quarter, it ran at roughly 45% utilization rate.","So the way I look at it is the margin capture really wasn't there for L.A. The San Francisco market is very different and so is the Ferndale \u2013 where Ferndale is, up in Seattle is very different. So we can't really quantify that piece of it, but there's roughly $100 million from the turnaround costs and then above that you've got the margin that's missing.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, we can take the rest offline. Thanks for that, Rosy. My follow-up I'm afraid is a policy question. You guys are one of the biggest importers, obviously, of Canadian crude. We've heard from some of your peers that they are seeing real allocations from OPEC suppliers. I'm just wondering if you could walk us through what can reduce the flexibility options you would have in the event that there is a border tax. So how you guys are thinking about that and whether you can confirm you're also seeing OPEC allocations? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Maybe let me address the broader border tax. First of all, you're correct. I think we've probably imported 1 million barrels last quarter...","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","That's right.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","...of crude. And we are probably the largest importer of Canadian crude within that 1 million barrels. So we support tax reform. We think it's important. We think it ought to be fair to all industries. You shouldn't pick winners and losers with your tax policy. Our view is that there's a lot of ground left to cover and that getting this tax change through is going to take more time than what people think. It looks like the Senate is going have their own plan against the Republican plan. But if just border tax goes through in the form as we understand it, we would pay more taxes on the Refining business at 20% than we pay at 35% today, so that's a negative.","We think crude prices go up 25%. We think gasoline prices go up $0.30 \u2013 $0.40 a gallon in that scenario. We're worried about demand destruction in that case and what happens. So we're concerned about second, third order, fourth order impacts beyond just that. But you think about increased domestic production that gets incented with higher prices, probably more Midstream infrastructure, so directionally it's probably good for our Midstream business. And you think across the Chemicals platform, and historically we've exported between 15% and 25% of ethylene produced in the U.S. and derivative equivalents. And I think that that's probably similar to what people are thinking going forward. So from an export perspective, the border tax adjustment would be good for the Chemicals business. So we have to think about it across all three of our platforms and how it impacts those platforms.","Now specifically to the Canadian crude question and how we might substitute that, I'm going to let Tim dive into that one.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yeah, Doug. So I think about our system and you think about our imports there, if you just took light, say U.S. crude is largely light, you probably got 400,000-barrels a day that we can put into additional light. Most of that could be U.S. in terms of rather than importing a light crude. You get the heavy crudes, the availability is not really there, so I think our view would be is that you'll still have to do that and that import is the marginal barrel. And that's why we see pricing would probably be parity in terms of a U.S. barrel versus an import barrel ultimately. And so I just think we'd continue to optimize, but it's unlikely that you could cover the entire U.S. refining need without imported barrels, even the border tax. I think as we look at it, just everything re-equilibrates and the impacts vary across our business lines.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Short term I'm not sure where the Canadian crude goes.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yeah.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I think it's got to drain south. Longer term, options can be developed for that. So I don't think we're worried about the Canadian crude going away. But it will have to price.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","That's right.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Such that the refiners run it.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","To be clear, Greg, so your comment about gasoline prices, my read of that is that you're suggesting you would be able to pass that cost through. Is that a fair read or not?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes, at $70, it's $14 a barrel. Our mid-cycle net income is about $2.25, so it just doesn't work.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","It's going to get passed \u2013 or mostly passed through.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I'm sorry. On the OPEC issue, just could you confirm whether you're seeing allocations there?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","I'd say that we've seen minimal impact in our business from our perspective. But certainly we see that when you just look at the macro data that cuts are there. I think it just takes time for that to work its way into the system. And if you go through the first quarter heavy turnarounds, particularly for heavier grades here in the U.S., it may take a while until that shows up. But generally if the cuts are really centered around heavy production, you would expect the light-heavy dip to narrow a bit. But I think that's an effect that you would see now over the next several quarters. And it's really going to show up in terms of will the inventories on global crude fall and where do you pull that? But I think it's early with that and we've not seen impacts with that yet.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate your answers, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon.","Rosy Zuklic - Phillips 66 Partners LP","Hi, Phil.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Hi, Phil.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Greg, last we talked to you, you were pretty conservative on your views for the Refining outlook and we've had a tough start to the year. I thought maybe you could just talk about your views maybe for the first half on Refining and then for the other parts of the business, Chemicals, how you're thinking about that for 2017 as well.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Okay, I'll start with we've got a lot of inventory with crude and products. And so for us, first half of 2017 feels about like 2016 to us at this point in time. I think as you start moving into the back half of 2017, we see some opportunity, certainly for margins to improve, but I think we need to pull down some inventories. And that also assumes that the demand is going be fairly good. And it's been fairly robust in 2016. We expect, I would say, good demand growth in 2017 in Refining.","So the other thing I would say, a heavy turnaround quarter it looks like in the first quarter globally across the Refining space. And so we'll see how that actually plays out, but there is a lot of turnaround activity across the globe. And that may back up some crude, but I think it will give us a chance to pull down some of the product inventory. So as we start moving into the second quarter \u2013 back half of the second quarter, we think things start to get better.","On Chemicals, we're still pretty bullish about demand growth. We think that we're still growing at 1.5 times GDP in the Chemicals business, and I think we see good opportunities in 2017. I think you're going to see the crackers that come up. So we're already signaling that we're towards the end of the year in 2017. So all these crackers won't come up in 2017. They'll be up in 2017 and 2018. So I think the market impact of those crackers coming is muted. And so I don't think we're going to see the depression in margins in 2017 that a lot of people had anticipated. Although we've always been probably more bullish on margins in 2017 than everyone else for the Chems. So I think Chems is set up for a pretty good year in 2017.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","I would say also, constructive on Chemicals, is if crude oil continues to rise relative to ethane, say, in the U.S., then that creates additional upside. So there will be some adjustments as the crackers come up, but generally operating rates look pretty strong and we're still seeing really good demand around the world.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it, thanks. And then my next question is just if I look at your CFO number for 2016, strip out the working capital tailwind of $500 million, it was sub-$2.5 billion, and I know the long-term target, Greg, you've talked about often is $4 billion to $5 billion. So I was trying to think about 2017 in the context of those two numbers in light of what your view is on the macro environment, the projects, et cetera. I mean it feels to me like it might be difficult to get above $3.5 billion this year, but I don't know if you've got any thoughts on that that you can share?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","We typically don't forecast cash flows for the year. I do think that you're going to see more cash generated in 2017 than in 2016 with these projects coming on, reduce capital expenditures. We've started $3.9 billion last year, came down at $2.28 billion end of 2016. We have kind of $2.7 billion target this year. I will say that as we look across the capital portfolio that we have, we're finishing up the big projects. And so a lot of what we have is a lot of smaller projects and we think they're good return projects, but we have a lot of discretionary room that we can move the capital budget. We probably have $500 million to $750 million of discretion in our capital budget this year that we could move, if we needed to.","And so I think that on balances that we'll be able to manage that. We are committed to increasing the dividend this year. We are committed to $1 billion to $2 billion of share repurchases, but you look at the growth profile we have at PSXP, we'll probably do somewhere around $2 billion-ish of, let's say, debt and some form of equity in 2017, just like 2016 to hit kind of our 2018 run rate number. I don't know, Kevin or Tim, do you want to step in?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yeah. Just one additional point and Tim touched on it earlier. You think about the equity affiliates. So in 2017, we should see some cash coming back from DCP. We should see more distributions from CPChem. And then, of course, that builds up, becomes even more significant when you get into 2018 and you got full year of operations on the cracker.","So there is a line of sight to increasing that operating cash flow, although of course, it's also heavily dependent on the margin environment as well.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Kevin, if I could just ask one more to you. The deferred tax piece big tailwind in 2015 and 2016. Could you elaborate on what the source of that deferred tax benefit has done and if it's something that's sustainable?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","So that derives from the \u2013 it's really part of the benefit of the heavy investment we've been going through. As these assets go into operation, we get to take bonus depreciation and so that effectively cuts your cash tax, Phil, and that's reflected through that deferred tax on the cash flow statement. So we had benefit in 2015, we had benefit in 2016 and we'd expect to see some benefit in 2017 again as well.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil. Your line is open.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Hey, folks. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about the guidance for utilization in 1Q. It looks to be pretty well below what you had been trending, and I was curious if you could help us out with understanding maybe regionally where some of those reductions are coming? And also if you could kind of confirm, I guess one of your peers had alluded to potential for economic run cuts. I didn't know if maybe any of that included economic cuts or if it was purely planned maintenance.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","It's all planned maintenance. We typically don't go into where, because we feel like it disadvantages our commercial folks when we do that, but it's going to be a heavy year for us in 2017. We try to do five-year turnaround cycles and what's happening, they're just lining up and then of course, you have regulatory targets you have to hit in terms of bringing assets out of service for inspection, et cetera. So I think we're going to \u2013 2016 was about where we were in 2015. So we're going be a little bit higher in 2017 in terms of total turnaround costs and the first quarter, it's a big lift for us. And you can see that in the forecasts we've given you in terms of op rates.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, fair enough.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Just a real quick comment on that. That's on the Refining side, there's probably around four of those major turnarounds going on around our system. Chemicals, as well, has a heavy turnaround schedule, one in the U.S. and one in the Middle East joint venture. That's why that operating rate's guided lower in Chemicals as well. It's not demand driven. It's really the turnaround that drives the Chemicals outlook.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Got it. Got it. Okay. The second question was on Beaumont. If I am not mistaken, I believe that was kind of providing a step change in your export capacity. And I was just hoping you could help me. It looks like expansion is kind of coming on in phases. So I didn't know if the export capability is kind of tied to when that comes on, or just any color there.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","So there's good demand for storage right now, as you might guess. And so we've done those projects. We're also in the process of really going through an engineering project to get our dock rate utilization up to go from 300,000 to 600,000. That's particularly important for crude. And so that's a project that would come on here in the next 12 to 18 months to be able to do that. And then as we step back, I think that that's going to don't be a benefit as producers look for options beyond just domestic consumption, but also to tie in to those export markets.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. But...","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","And that is a \u2013 yep. Go ahead.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","It sounds like that's more of an end of quarter \u2013 end of 1Q. In other words...","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yeah.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","...that capacity is not open right now.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","That capacity, we're limited on that today. We're going to debottleneck that piece as part of our debottleneck plan at Beaumont and the master plan that we have.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, thank you very much.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","On the export.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Thanks, Blake.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.

Garland - Phillips 66","Hey, Brad.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Good morning.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","As a follow on to last question about exports, I was just wondering if you could go through sort of what you're seeing in the export markets for products right now, how the demand is looking?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Demand was really good. We ramped up in the fourth quarter. You've seen that really around industry data. So I think it's still there. I think Latin American refining system on the clean products side is continued to have issues, and that's created an opportunity. So that continues. So we still feel bullish in terms of the export side on the clean products.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks for that. And then, Greg, I think during this call you've said a couple of times you're committed to a dividend increase in 2017. I think in the past the guidance had always been for double-digit. Am I to assume that because you're not saying double-digit that it's just an increase in the dividend at this point and not necessarily that?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","We really haven't given guidance on exactly how much, but you should expect that it'll be in line with our desire to have a strong secure growing and competitive dividend. So we'll look at all those things when we make the decision around the dividend later this year.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, guys. How are you?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Good. Thank you.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, a question on slides 19 to 22 where you do the Refining margin walk. And the market capture was softer than what we would have expected across a number of the different regions. Can you talk about how you're thinking about that capture rate on a go forward basis? And there're two bars in particular; secondary products and other. If you could help us understand what's driving some of the movements in both of those bars, that'd be great. Thank you.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Neil, this is Kevin. The secondary products line is simply a function of the delta between your crude costs and the products \u2013 the non-clean products. So the sort of 15% or so of non-clean production which typically doesn't track with crude to the same extent. So as a rule of thumb as crude prices increase, then the losses on secondary products on a per barrel basis will increase and that will hurt capture. You see the opposite apply when crude prices decline. That drag on capture tends to be reduced. In the other, you have a whole series of items that can actually go in either direction relative to overall capture. So you've got the RINs expense is recorded there. The freight costs for outbound product is in there. Any of these product differentials, so when we talk about the actual realized product price versus the marker, then that will manifest itself in that part of the calculation.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Appreciate that, Kevin. And then follow-up is earlier this week one of your peers was commenting that they were seeing same store sales through their gas station network down 3% to 4% in January on a year-to-date basis. As you look at your marketing business recognizing you don't have the gas station business but your marketing business, are you seeing negative gasoline demand trends here in the U.S. to start 2017?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I think seasonally, Neil, you see that this is a weaker driving time. So if you're looking sequentially over, say, the third quarter, you do see an impact. If you look at year ago, we continue to see on the same store growth in that. And so, I think that our anticipation is as you get back now into the spring and the driving season that you should begin to see that, but still gasoline to us we had good growth as an industry. We saw it in our chains and then I think this year we would expect some gasoline growth as well, but probably not as strong as we start to kind of the impact of pricing and vehicles miles driven et cetera begin to saturate. So, I think we're still thinking it's there. What's interesting, maybe, as an aside is that we're seeing a pickup in distillate on the transportation side which is I think very important to help bring some strength back into that market too.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Good morning, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, maybe as a follow-up to, I think it was Phil's questions, on cash flow. If we think about the projects you're talking about in the future here in terms of frac two and three, how should we think about maybe a beyond 2017 CapEx kind of run rate? And obviously we don't go back maybe to the 2015 levels of spending, but is what we've seen last year and kind of expectations for this year the right way to think about it?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yeah. I think that kind of a $3 billion run rate is something we're comfortable with. And that's $1 billion-ish of sustaining capital and $2 billion of growth capital. And we think we can get done what we needed to get done within those boundaries.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then in a situation like that I would expect, and let's assume, a normal price environment, whatever that really is. You'd be cash flow positive. What would be the kind of plan after that, that it would be to reduce debt, to up share repurchases? Is it","that you'd favor dividend? I'm just sort of curious which direction we should think about things going?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I think that as we think about the hierarchy of how we allocate cash, the first thing is the sustaining capital. That's $1.1 billion or so. And the next goes to our dividend, and that's $1.3 billion, and we'll grow that every year going forward. Then we think about our investable opportunities and the returns that we can generate from those investable opportunities versus what we think the returns we can generate by buying our shares back in. And so we've got a natural tension there, but there's a competition there for that. And at this point in time, I don't think we see anything different from the guidance we've given in terms of the 60:40 allocation of reinvesting in the business versus distributions back to our shareholders.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Corey Goldman with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. How's it going?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Great. Thanks. How you doing this morning?","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Not bad. I just wanted to get some more color on slide 17, the new sensitivity table you guys outlined, and specifically that for DCP. So DCP sensitivity in NGLs, it looks as though it's about 80% lower than what it was in 2016. Assuming some of those were just self-help initiatives or re-contracting, can you comment on what drove the rest of that reduction? Are there hedges in place there? And if so, are they direct products?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","This is Kevin. You're exactly right. The delta there is driven by the hedges that are in place at DCP, which means from an earnings standpoint, you're not going to see the same \u2013 as much upside or downside to changes in commodity prices. And so there's hedges on NGLs and crude, if I've got those details right in my mind. Of course, the accounting drives it to be not always quite intuitive because the hedges are in place through the end of 2017. So at the end of each quarter, you're marking those future volumes through the end of the year. So there may or may not be an offset relative to the gain on the physical versus the paper that you're hedging out through the end of the year. Obviously as you progress through the year, that effect is muted somewhat.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I think if you think about the total equity link that we have at the new DCP enterprise, we probably hedged a third of that or so.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","That's right, 30%.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yeah. The other thing is that LLC used to be a 100% or 50:50 owned. Now it's down. The ownership percentage is effectively 38%. So there's some of that commodity exposure now that's moved into that piece of that along with the hedge effects.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Interesting. All right. And then maybe as a follow-up, given just how large DCP is in the overall NGL market in terms of overall production, did you see an impact on the price itself while you were out making the purchases for the hedges?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","No, I'm not aware of any. No. No, I'm not aware of anything there.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Okay, and maybe just one last one, if I could. I think you had somewhat answered it in your previous answer. There are no hedges in 2018. Are we correct in stating that?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","I believe that's correct.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Okay, that's it for us. I just wanted to make sure. Thanks, guys.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Take care.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Good morning.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Maybe this is for Tim. Tim, for the NGL fractionator two or three if you do decide to go ahead, should we assume it's nearly a carbon copy of the fractionator number one, so it is going to cost about $1 billion? And if that's the case, is that going to be housed by PSX, or it is going to be in the MLP for Phillips 66 Partners given that it should be getting big enough that they can maybe be able to do it? And...","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yeah...","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And what sort of timeline on FID you may be thinking about at this point?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Okay. So the capital, I think the beauty of a second frac is you can leverage some of the infrastructure you put in place. So I think our view is the next increment of capital will be lower because you've got all the utilities and some of the caverns, et cetera, pipes in place, and we planned for that. So that's a beneficial incremental project.","And then in terms of when we could do that, as Greg mentioned earlier, we're seeing a lot of NGL looking at our de-ramp or the ramp-up on Sand Hills out of the Permian. And so producers are beginning to ask that. So I think we're looking to develop that. But ultimately, you look at the Permian, the Eagle Ford and the recovery that we're seeing in the Mid-Continent as well and you believe there's going be need for the fractionation. So the timing, we'd like to have, you would say maybe later this year, but it's one we're always going keep on the front burner as we develop that, but we don't want to do that until we're contracted around that.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And is it going be housed by PSX, or is it going be by the Partners?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","The current frac is owned by the Partners. And so I think they are getting much bigger. They're doing a CapEx spend today that's over $400 million. And so it's getting into a point where they could do that. It may be a bit early on that, Paul, depending on the timing. But ultimately we'd like to move as much of the Midstream spend into PSXP that it makes sense to do and that they can manage. So I think getting bigger they've already taken on significant amount of our consolidated capital budget already.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Tim, if you guys are going to do the second, you think cracker, I think Greg had mentioned previously, I think at one point he was talking about 2018 and then talking about 2019. Are we still talking about 2019 tie up the next FID, or that also had been changed?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Second cracker.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","I think it's post-2018. I think the soonest you see FID based on in-sharing and where we are working at the CPChem level, that would likely become now 2019 \u2013 2020 decision on FID.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And when I'm looking at the turnaround or that the utilization rate you guys mentioned in the Refining low 80% in the crude, should we assume that your total throughput is also going be in the low-80% to the total throughput capacity or that the turnaround is really more in the crude and your conversion (1:01:07) and so as a result, your total throughput is not going be down that much?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","No. Fundamentally as you look at these, these are major turnarounds, Paul, and so it's roughly going approximate that utilization that we've guided to.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And finally, I just want to confirm. Tim, you mentioned earlier that you guys still seeing gasoline demand growth in January in your system? Because if we're looking at the DOE number there, they talk about a 5% to 6% drop. Marathon Petroleum was talking about in their network dropping about 3% to 4%. So just want to confirm whether I understand you correctly saying in your wholesale system that in January you're still seeing year-over-year gain?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","I said sequentially you see a decline, but year-on-year same period, you've seen the growth. So no.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","We've seen decline sequentially in January as you would expect from a seasonal input.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, but I'm talking about year-over-year. Say, January of this year comparing to January of last year.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","No. We still \u2013 from our system, our view is that we still see a small increase in the gasoline through our same stores year-on-year.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Well, interesting","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Just over 1%.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yeah, 1%. Yeah.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Pretty small, but still there.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That looks like a rock star comparing to the DOE number.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yeah.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Greg C.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Clayton Reasor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Affairs. Mr. Reasor, you may begin.","C. Clayton Reasor","Thanks, John. Good morning, welcome to the Phillips 66 fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me this morning are Greg Garland, our Chairman and CEO; our CFO, Greg Maxwell; and EVP, Tim Taylor.","The presentation material we\u2019ll be using this morning can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental, financial, and operating information.","Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It\u2019s a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from today\u2019s comments. Factors that could cause these results to differ are included here on the second page, as well as in our filings with the SEC. This slide also contains a reminder that any comments we make regarding the formation of an MPL are not in offer of securities.","So that said, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg Garland for some opening comments. Greg?","Greg C. Garland","Thanks, Clayton. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. We are off to a good start, strong performance in 2012, we have solid financial and operating results and we continue to deliver on the commitments that we set out to achieve when Phillips 66 was created.","We believe that our differentiated portfolio has allowed us to capture a number of market opportunities across the value chain resulting in significant cash generation and shareholder value creation. I\u2019m really pleased what our employees have been able to accomplish; they\u2019ve executed the spin flawlessly, they stood the company up, they\u2019ve operated well, and they\u2019ve managed to keep safety as the top priority.","We\u2019ve had a strong track record of operating excellence and when we talk about that operating excellence is personal safety, it\u2019s process safety, it\u2019s environmental excellence, it\u2019s reliability, it\u2019s cost management. This year was no exception. We turn it one of the best years ever and Phillips 66 remains a leader in operations excellence. That said, there is always room for improvement, the goal is zero instance, and our facilities continue to reduce costs, improve our reliability in our environmental footprint.","Late last year, we announced our intent to form a Master Limited Partnership, which we expect will help highlight the value of our transportation logistics in midstream businesses. We also serve as an efficient vehicle for funding growth investments in these areas. We also expect to start taking delivery of the first group of our 2000 newly constructed railcars in early February.","In January, we\u2019ve entered into a five-year transportation logistics contract with global partners to move about 90 million barrels of Bakken crude to our Bayway Refinery. This agreement provides a reliable, long-term alternative to more expensive Brent-priced crudes. On the marine side we\u2019ve taken delivery of one of two Jones Act vessels that we chartered.","So all these steps support our plan to put advantage crudes to the front-end of our refineries, we\u2019ve got ways to continue to accelerate advantage crude capture. We completely backed out imports of U.S. light sweet crude in the Gulf Coast. But we are also taking additional steps to enhance our returns. We\u2019re going to remain very disciplined, and our approach to capital spending, we\u2019ll continue to reduce cost, we\u2019ll push yields and we\u2019ll continue to increase our export ability.","Product exports played a larger role in our result this year than last year as market opportunities opened up to us internationally. December was a record month for us in terms of exports. We had over 180,000 barrels of day of exports in the month of December. Regarding distributions, we said that we intend to return capital to our shareholders. We\u2019ve raised the divided 56% to $1.25 and we\u2019ve announced $2 billion to share repurchases.","In 2012, we bought over 7 million shares for about $350 million. Late last year, we paid down $1 billion of debt, this further strengthens our financial flexibility, it reduces risk and our debt to cap is now 25% at year end.","So now I\u2019m going to hand the conversation over to Greg Maxwell, who will take you through the quarterly results. Greg?","Greg G. Maxwell","Thank you, Greg. Good morning everyone. During the quarter, we ran well, we benefited from strong refining and chemical margins, and we processed more advanced crudes in our domestic refineries and this enabled us to increase our realized refining crack spreads moving our market capture to 95% in the fourth quarter and this is up from 72% last year.","On the earnings front, our reported earnings were $708 million or a $1.11 per share. Excluding approximately $600 million in special items, adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion or $2.06 a share. On an adjusted basis, earnings for the quarter were up almost 250% compared to last year. If we exclude changes in working capital, cash flow from operations for the quarter was $1.7 billion. Our cash flow generation enabled us to fund our capital program, pay over a $150 million in dividends, and repurchase $245 million of common stock during the quarter.","And as Greg mentioned, we reduced our debt by $1 billion from $8 billion to $7 billion and as you will see on a later slide we ended the year with a cash balance of $3.5 billion. On an adjusted basis, our full year 2012 return on capital employed was 22%. That\u2019s up from 14% in 2011, and this improvement was mainly due to higher earnings in our Refining and Marketing and Chemical segments.","Before we leave this slide, I would like to touch on a few key items this quarter. First, the special items of approximately $600 million included $564 million for the impairment of our equity investment in the Morocco refinery. This impairment was based on significantly lower estimated future refining margins in the region, driven primarily by expected increases in future crude oil pricing over the long-term. As such, we determine that the fair value of our investment in Morocco was lower than our carrying value and that this loss in value was other than temporary.","Second, excluding special items, our adjusted effective tax rate was 29% this quarter compared to 33% last quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate is mainly due to income mix and different statutory tax rates across the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. In other words, compared to last quarter, a higher proportion of our earnings this quarter were from foreign jurisdictions with relatively lower tax rates.","The next slide provides a high level look at our fourth quarter adjusted earnings. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, our adjusted earnings increased by over $900 million to $1.3 billion. As shown, Refining and Marketing generated $1.1 billion in adjusted earnings, and this excludes the impact of the Morocco refinery impairment, as well as Hurricane Sandy related costs, which primarily impacted our Bayway refinery along with some nearby terminals.","The majority of the $900 million improvement in R&M segment came from much stronger refining margins due largely to improve market crack spreads and strong feedstock advantages.","Moving next to Midstream, Midstream adjusted earnings were $62 million, about $50 million lower than last year. This decline in earnings primarily reflects the impact of lower NGL prices quarter-over-quarter. Chemicals earnings were $246 million, which were approximately $100 million higher than the corresponding quarter of 2011, and this is mainly due to higher margins especially in the Olefins & Polyolefins chain.","Excluding repositioning costs in a corporate property impairment, corporate and other costs this quarter were $92 million. The cost bearings of $41 million is largely due to interest expense on debt associated with the repositioning that didn\u2019t exist in the same quarter last year. I\u2019ll cover each of these operating segments in more detail later in the presentation.","Our fourth quarter cash flow is shown on slide 6. During the quarter, we generated $1.7 billion in cash from operations, excluding working capital. Changes in working capital negatively impacted cash flow by $400 million with a net change primarily due to tax payments.","As shown on the chart, we paid down $1 billion of debt. We also funded $900 million of capital expenditures and investments that includes approximately $500 million for our investments in the Sand Hills and Southern Hills pipelines that are being constructed by DCP Midstream. And during the quarter, we\u2019ve returned $400 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","In summary, during the quarter, we generated sufficient cash to fund our capital program along with our dividend and share repurchase programs. and with the $1 billion debt repayment, we took our cash balance down to $3.5 billion at year-end.","As for our capital structure on Slide 11, our equity has increased almost $2 billion since the second quarter and debt is decreased by $1 billion. This has enabled us to reduce our debt to capital ratio to the middle of our targeted range of 20% to 30%, and taking into account our $3.5 billion ending cash balance, our net debt to capital ratio is 14%.","Next we will cover each of our operating segments in more details, starting with refining and marketing on Slide 8. In refining and marketing, our refining realized margin was $13.67 per barrel with a global crude utilization rate of 91% and a clean product yield of 83%. Our utilization rate was negatively impacted by turnarounds at the Wood River, Borger, and Los Angeles refineries, as well as Hurricane Sandy related unplanned downtime at our Bayway refinery.","During the quarter, we continued our efforts to run more advantaged crudes, the 67% of our U.S. crude slightly in advantage, and this compares to 57% in the fourth quarter of last year. Our return on capital employed for the R&M segment, which includes over $3 billion in goodwill improved to 22% this year and this is up from the 12% return that we had in 2011.","Slide 9 provides more detail on Refining and Marketing\u2019s earnings. Adjusted earnings for R&M was $1.1 billion this quarter, and this is up $927 million from a year ago, reflecting improvements in all of our regions, especially in the Gulf Coast and Central Corridor region. Marketing, Specialties and Others were also up driven largely by our international operations.","The earnings of all four of our refining regions increased primarily due to improved refining margins. The improvements in refining margins, reflects not only higher market crack spreads, but also an improved feedstock advantage especially in the Gulf Coast, in the Central Corridor regions. The improvements in feedstock advantage increased earnings in the Gulf Coast by over $200 million and by over $100 million in the Central Corridor. Finally, other refining was up this quarter compared to last year, primarily due to movements of Canadian crude supply to several of our refineries.","As we move on to marketing specialties and other, the U.S. was down by $2 million, primarily due to higher taxes and costs and this was partially offset by higher U.S. marketing margins. Internationally, MSO was up $40 million, mainly as a result of higher margins. The next few slides highlight our performance in refining and provides more detail on marketing specialties and other.","On slide 10, you can see refining\u2019s adjusted earnings increased almost $900 million compared to a year ago. Improved margins were the key driver with higher market cracks and greater feedstock advantages, being partially offset by inventory impacts. The inventory impacts were largely driven by gains recognized in 2011 that were tied to asset sales and shutdowns. Lower volumes negatively impacted earnings by $42 million, mainly in the Atlantic basin and the Central Corridor regions, reflecting unplanned downtime due to Hurricane Sandy and plant turnarounds.","Operating costs were up slightly reflecting higher utilities and maintenance cost. The other category includes positive earnings impacts from lower effective tax rates, primarily due to income mix and federal tax adjustments. Now let\u2019s take a look at our market capture shown on slide 11.","On this slide, we compare the global market crack with our realized crack spreads. Our realized margin for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $13.67 per barrel, and this resulted in a market capture of 95%. This is quite a bit higher than the 74% that we\u2019ve achieved over the last four years. At a high level, market capture in the fourth quarter was exceptional as feedstock advantages, product differentials, and volume gains largely offset the negative impacts associated with the lower valued secondary products.","Let\u2019s walk through the details on the slide. The $0.58 configuration adjustment reflects the fact that our claim product yield of 83% is less than the 100% assumed in the market crack. The negative configuration impact was improved this quarter largely due to our strong distillate production, coupled with healthy distillate prices. The $5.64 per barrel reduction related to the secondary products reflects the fact that these products attracted the sales price that on average were lower than the cost of our benchmark crudes.","The positive $3.69 per barrel adjustment per feedstocks stems from running certain crudes and other feedstocks that are priced lower than our benchmark crudes. For example, our feedstock advantage this quarter was primarily related to running for an heavy-sour crudes at our Gulf Coast refineries and Canadian crudes in our refineries in the Central Corridor. In addition, our crude slate is increased to include more shale crudes, primarily Bakken and Eagle. Finally, the other category primarily reflects the impacts of volume gain and product differentials.","Slide 12 shows the percentage of advantaged crude runs at our refineries, as well as clean product yields for 2011 and 2012. Many of our refineries have the complexity to run price advantage, Canadian, Bakken and Eagle Ford crudes. Shale crudes are being run in all four of our refinery regions and in addition, we have access to multiple transportation systems to reliably deliver these crudes to our U.S. refineries providing an overall competitive advantage. For the year, our U.S. advantage crude slate increased from 52% in 2011 to 62% this year, and for the month of December, this average was up to 70%.","We will discuss Marketing, Specialties and Other or MSO on the next slide. MSO generated adjusted earnings of $180 million, which is $38 million higher than the same quarter last year. As shown on the slide, higher margins were the main driver for the increase, making up almost $90 million in variance. Margins improved primarily due to better market conditions and favorable inventory impacts this quarter.","Volumes decreased $26 million quarter-over-quarter primarily due to reduced production at our Immingham power plant in the UK as well as lower U.S. marketing volumes, primarily due to lower demand. Volumes were also lower due to downtime at the border refining. Operating cost increased $20 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher environmental and legal costs.","Slide 14 shows our per barrel metrics. Refining and marketing income per barrel increase this quarter to $4.12 per barrel versus $0.59 a barrel a year ago, with cash contributions of $5 per barrel, up $3.57 compared to the fourth quarter of last year. For the year, R&M\u2019s income per barrel was $4.28 and this is up $1.95 compared to 2011. This completes our review of the Refining and Marketing business segment. Next, we\u2019ll move to the Midstream segment.","Our Midstream segment had lower equity earnings from DCP Midstream, largely driven by depressed NGL prices. NGL prices were down 36% compared to last year. Although down compared to 2011, return on capital employed for the year was still strong at 22%.","We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in capital employed in our Midstream segment. And as I said earlier, during the fourth quarter we closed our investments in the Sand Hills and the Southern Hills pipelines that are being constructed by DCP Midstream, and these pipes are scheduled for startup this year.","Slide 16 shows a Midstream\u2019s adjusted earnings of $62 million, includes $38 million in earnings associated with our interest in DCP Midstream and $24 million for our other Midstream businesses.","The next slide provides additional earnings detail for both DCP Midstream and our other Midstream earnings. As shown on the top portion of this slide, earnings associated with our interest in DCP decreased by $21 million this quarter due primarily to lower NGL prices. This was partially offset by a reduction in the depreciation expense that is tied to an overall increase in the remaining useful lives of DCP\u2019s assets that was implemented in the second quarter of this year. Our other Midstream business was down $30 million primarily driven by positive inventory impacts in 2011 along with higher taxes.","On the next slide we\u2019ll move on to the discussion of our Chemical segment. Our Chemical segment had another solid quarter providing earnings of $246 million. Overall, CPChem achieved a 90% capacity utilization rate and its O&P segment in the fourth quarter. This was down somewhat from the third quarter due to unplanned downtime at the Saudi Polymers petrochemical facility. If we exclude this downtime in SPCo, CPChem\u2019s utilization rate was near capacity for the quarter. 2012 return on capital employed from our Chemicals segment increased to 31%. This is up form 28% last year and we ended the quarter with $3.6 billion in capital employed.","As shown on slide 19, fourth quarter earnings increased by $98 million compared to the same period last year. This increase in earning was primarily in Olefins and Polyolefins due to stronger chain margins. The drivers for this increase was primarily from reduced feedstock cost due to higher industry ethane and propane inventories, as well as continued strong demand for ethylene derivatives.","Looking at CPChem\u2019s operating segments on the next slide, Olefins and Polyolefins generated earnings of $216 million in the fourth quarter. This $97 million increase was due primarily from higher olefins, polyolefins chain margins, partially offset by higher operating costs.","In addition quarter-over-quarter marketed sales volumes in O&P were up 8%. Specialties, Aromatics & Styrenics earnings increased by 73% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher benzene earnings.","This concludes our discussion of the financial and operating results for the fourth quarter. Next, I\u2019d like to provide a few outlook items for the first quarter.","In Refining and Marketing, for the first quarter we expect our global utilization rate to be in the low 90s, and our pretax turnaround expense to be approximately $100 million.","In Midstream, we expect our additional direct investments in the Sand Hills and the Southern Hills pipelines to be approximately $120 million in the first quarter.","In Chemicals, although there were some initial unplanned downtime with Saudi Polymers, petrochemical complex, it is now up and running. Under normal operations, we expect SPCo to return roughly a $175 million to $225 million per year to CPChem with our share being 50%.","Corporate and other costs are expected to be about $40 billion a month on an aftertax basis or approximately $120 million for the quarter. And this includes aftertax net interest expense of about $40 million. As for the Company\u2019s effective tax rate, we expect the rate to be in the low 30s for the quarter.","Regarding share repurchases, we plan to complete the initial $1 billion of repurchases in 2013, and initiate the second billion dollar tranche prior to the end of the year. We\u2019ll continue to keep you advised on the status of our repurchase program on quarterly earnings calls. With regard to our recently announced MLP, we are still on track with our plans to file the S1 with the SEC by early in the second quarter.","Finally, starting with the first quarter earnings call, we\u2019ll provide you with updates on our Optimize 66 initiative, recall that this initiative includes capturing $200 million in pretax cost savings compared to what the costs would have been without implementation of this initiative.","This concludes our guidance for the first quarter. With that, we\u2019ll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hey, good morning and congratulations on a strong quarter. I guess, there is a lot of focus on all the crude that\u2019s coming down into the gulf and obviously you\u2019ve got three refineries down there. Sweeny looks like well positioned, but can you comment on maybe two aspects; one, what is \u2013 as you look at the market that sort of incremental costs or any constraints on moving crude from say the bottom of seaway to Lake Charles and then along to Alliance. And then the second question is, as we look at tanker rates that are rising rapidly for Jones Act ships. Can you comment a little bit on how it\u2019s so secure low cost shipping access to from the Gulf to Bayway? Thank you.","Greg C. Garland","Well, thanks Ed. Good morning. So let me add a couple of generic comments and I\u2019ll let Tim go in some of the details around that. So we\u2019ve backed out all likes we proved important into the Gulf Coast. One of the reasons we took the Jones Act vessels is we thought that was an opportunity. We want to move quickly, there is very few of those vessels that are available. And with the idea really taking Eagle Ford volumes from corporate around to Haynes and coming in through loop system and then going on around the Bayway. So I mean, that was the basic premises we acquired those vessels for. Right, there is very few of those out there. They are difficult to attain. We think there is probably 32 or so vessels that are in service today, that are available to do this, most of them are taken or chart. So Tim, I know you will fill-in a little more color on that.","Timothy G. Taylor","Ed, as far as the crude movements along the Gulf Coast, still primarily for us, it\u2019s marine particularly at this point. The pipeline capacity going east is going to improve [Ho-Ho] and you\u2019ve got the real facilities at St. James, but for us the primary mode that we\u2019ve used to increase the shale runs has been through marine movements, primarily out of South Texas to the three Gulf Coast refineries.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","That\u2019s very helpful. And then just my second question on the ethane crackers, you\u2019ve got some negative chat that\u2019s just coming out of the Gulf on execution issues, are there any updates in terms of the cost study that you have done for that cracker and potential timing?","Greg C. Garland","I would say that we are on track for the cracker, Ed. We will take FID this year yet on that facility. We are continuing to prosecute the engineering long lead items on that. We are moving the permitting process forward and we will take FID on that. So the cost, we will see as we finish up kind of our pre-engineering if you will on that, where they come in, but we are still thinking it\u2019s around the $5 billion range.","We have talked a lot about we think if there is four to five grassroots crackers build, we are concerned about execution capability for the contracting community, are there enough welders, pipe fitters, electrician\u2019s etcetera to execute all of these projects. So one of the reasons we want to be first in the queue is get the jump on that and make sure that we get our pick of the very best people in the industry to execute the project for us.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks very much and well done again.","Greg C. Garland","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kate Minyard from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kate Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick question on the crude slate that you are running, can you talk about whether there were any practical or logistical limitations within the refining system to how much sweet versus how much heavy crude you can run? I mean, what your flexibility parameters are there?","Greg C. Garland","Okay. We can certainly do that. Kate, good morning, thanks. So we can run about 350 a day in the Gulf Coast of light sweet crude, and we can push the limits of that, it\u2019s Sweeny primarily a heavier refinery we can run I guess on our 60th day of light sweet there. We\u2019ve looked at running off sweet at that facility, and we would have to derate the facility by about 20% or so.","We know what the investment is to correct that is by less than $50 million, it\u2019s Sweeny for us, so we\u2019ll look at that and watch that. But as you think about the opportunities that, you can\u2019t take that as a generic across the entire refining system, because refineries are different, they can figure differently, and so that\u2019s just one specific example for Sweeny. But without question, I think we\u2019re up about a 130 a day of shale pipe crudes that we\u2019ve run, it\u2019s primarily Eagle Ford or with some Bakken coming in.","And currently as we start taking delivery the 2000 railcars with the global deal, we\u2019re going to move more Bakken, East and West primarily Bayway and our Ferndale refineries, as we try to accelerate the advantage crude capture. We think we have quite a bit of room left to run in terms of accelerating advantage crude capture around our refineries.","Kate Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then just another question on exports. When you look at the export opportunity and the growth in export, are your exported volumes actually enabling you to capture higher prices than you\u2019d get in the domestic market, or is it simply the fact that you are able to \u2013 is it a volume uplift, and that\u2019s where the benefit from export is coming from, or is it a mix of both?","Greg C. Garland","Well, it\u2019s both. It\u2019s really the volumes going to or allow us to run higher operating rates, but we\u2019ve made 47% more net income exporting this year than we did last year those prices were better in the international market. So it is a combination of both.","Kate Minyard \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, all right. Thanks very much.","Greg C. Garland","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group, Inc.","Good morning and congratulations on great executions and spin-off everybody.","Greg C. Garland","Thanks, Doug.","Greg G. Maxwell","Thanks, Doug.","Doug Terreson - ISI Group, Inc.","My first question involved the comments that Greg Maxwell made a few minutes ago about the impairment at Malacca and specifically the report about the higher oil prices being envisioned in the region meaning. Were there some type of crude oil procurement arrangement that lapsed over the \u2013 within context of a margin outlook or did I miss here. So could you just elaborate on or clarify about what you talked about there Greg?","Timothy G. Taylor","Doug, this is Tim. I may comment on that.","Doug Terreson - ISI Group, Inc.","Okay.","Timothy G. Taylor","I look at it as really the fact that a) demand in Asia is growing.","Doug Terreson - ISI Group, Inc.","Right.","Timothy G. Taylor","So you are putting pressure on both the light and medium grades, which fit that refinery in Malacca. And then you\u2019ve had some effects posted only in Japan. So our fundamental view is that the demand picture in Asia has lowered those differentials, narrowed those differentials, and has brought that base crude price up. So it\u2019s primarily a margin issue.","Doug Terreson - ISI Group, Inc.","I see. And Tim, I may have \u2013 the next question maybe for you too. So product demand in North America and Europe was pretty poor last year. And it looks like there might have been a modest uptick during November and December. So of course, you guys have facilities in both areas, I want to see if you would provide your insight in the current product demand in the U.S. and in Europe, and whether or not you are seeing any improvement?","Timothy G. Taylor","Yeah, I would say that basically demand still lackluster, but it\u2019s certainly, not completely gone. Clearly, I think we still see flat to declining demand on gasoline distillate we expect to improve with the economy in North America. Europe, still relatively weak but based on our refining positions and the nature of our retail market in Central Europe and our Humber Refinery with its focus on specialty, we\u2019ve really not seen that to be an issue for us.","Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Mohit Bhardwaj \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Hi, this is actually Mohit Bhardwaj for Faisel Khan. I\u2019ve got a question on the Gulf Coast crude runs, if you guys could just give us a color on as far as the light crudes were concerned, how much are below LLS benchmark those were priced, the crudes that run on the Gulf Coast and same for the heavy versus lighter? Thanks.","Timothy G. Taylor","This is Tim, again. So basically on the light crude coming out of South Texas, I think we would plan on say $5 to $8 a barrel advantage. we have seen LLS begin to move a bit as that supplies increased. So we think that that will continue to improve that crudes position or slate as well. And the light heavy differential, that was favorable in this quarter and we still think that that provide substantial uplift versus the light given our refining configuration.","Mohit Bhardwaj \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","And do you have an estimate on like in some of the other barrels that are just floating around at least in the fourth quarter versus mild, what the differential was on the heavy side?","Timothy G. Taylor","Now I really haven\u2019t gotten too specifics of that. We buy a variety of those crudes and so we\u2019re able to capture some of that differential that we\u2019ve seen.","Greg C. Garland","There is limitations as to what we can disclose given the confidentiality club\u2026","Mohit Bhardwaj \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Sure. Yeah, I understand it. Thank you.","Greg C. Garland","","Okay.","Operator","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Hi, everyone. I was just wondering further to your split and then the first analyst meeting that you had as a new company. Greg, what do you feel that the market understood well about the company from the analyst meeting or what do you think that was kind of misunderstood from the message you were trying to convey? Thanks.","Greg C. Garland","Thanks, Paul. Well, so that we were pleased with the analyst meeting. In general I think we were consistent with what we\u2019ve been communicating to the market in terms of our strategy around improving our returns, growing our higher return in faster growing businesses and mainstream and chemicals and really lying out of plan and strategy improve the base of returns on refining business through advantage crude capture reducing costs, driving yields and ultimately 400 basis point improvement in refining.","So I think if there was a disappointment that they may have been around the MLP announcement and the fact that we couldn\u2019t talk about, it is as much as we would have like to or probably as much as you would have like for us to do. But we just reiterate, we think that that\u2019s the value creating proposition for Phillips 66 shareholders and we\u2019ll continue to prosecute that\u2019s a share and we finally get it done this year.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And when I think that the number was kind of $700 million of EBITDA that would be associated with that business whether or not that was at the high-end of the range, low end of the range or a reasonable number.","Greg C. Garland","Yeah, I think we\u2019ve said that we really can\u2019t say a whole lot about the EBITDA that we would consider putting in MLP until we get the S-1 filed. So just have to be patient on that one.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, I certainly understand. You got some stuff on NGLs around NGL pricing being so weak. Can you talk about \u2013 I know you have great sensitivities and stuff. But can you just remind us again, firstly, the sensitivities now and how they impact you positively or negatively? And secondly of how you expect that change over time.","","Greg C. Garland","So first of all, since of the $0.01 a gallon and NGL price is about $4 million of net income back to us. So as you think across the midstream space, the chemical space, we are a net buyer of NGLs, so we are capturing that value in the chemical space. Long-term, we think that fundamentally, the midstream business is a good place to invest. We have got aggressive growth plans in there. I do think that we are going to be in for a period of Baltimore pricing in NGLs for the next four or five years, until the petrochemical facilities come up until the export facilities get build for the propane, butane, and heavier essentially.","And so I think you have got this period of time that the demand side needs to kind of catch up, with the supply side in the midstream space, but I think the other thing you got to think about too is, what you are starting to see is because of the investment, because of the need to clear these new basins, a lot of the new investment is really evolving and moving to more fee based type contracts around this infrastructure. So what you are going to see is a reduced sensitivity longer term in the midstream space as there is more fee based assets put in service.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, that was kind of what I was driving at, so is there anyway you can quantify how that might shift your sensitivity, and in more specific timeframe, because obviously if you are talking about only 45 years of over supply, it\u2019s kind of the worrying outlook.","Greg G. Maxwell","Yeah. You would expect the sensitivity to fall overtime in midstream.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Greg G. Maxwell","But in the chemical side, it actually goes the other away as we increase the amount of ethane that we run.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I was just trying to be more specific and I was wondering if there was some sort of idea of how much was fee based and everything else and how shift overtime, the time in which we got down?","Greg C. Garland","I think we have talked about DCP having 70% of its contracts on a POP basis historically, and we\u2019re shifting that to 40%.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","40%, yeah.","Timothy G. Taylor","","So if you look at the new pipes we\u2019re building whether it\u2019s Sand Hills or Southern Hills, or some of the other projects we\u2019re considering. As Greg said, those are free bays, so we won\u2019t have the exposure there. And traditionally I guess the gathering and processing business will be a PLP type, but that will be a smaller percentage of the total business. So whether or not that sensitivity is 50% of what it is today, five years from now or\u2026.","Greg C. Garland","It\u2019s a good question. But ultimately NGL prices are going to recover is our view and so, I think you\u2019re going to have a still kind of good mix of what I would call risk to commodity exposure in your national gas and your NGL prices and then the fee.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Greg C. Garland","But I think where it\u2019s exactly going off.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good guidance around that.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Cooperative. Please go ahead.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Good morning.","Greg C. Garland","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","You talked about product exports in your press release and having current capacity of 285,000 barrels a day going up to 370,000 by the end of the year. Could you talk about your fourth quarter product exports, what you\u2019re actually exporting in the fourth quarter and maybe how that compares to fourth quarter of the previous year?","Greg C. Garland","So in the fourth quarter, we were impacted a little bit with some of the hurricane effects, but overall exports were up to 108,000 in December and on average for the year, we were up slightly. So I see that as probably a growing area for us. I think December reflects what we\u2019ll see as the trend and I think the pricing incentives are there and certainly the run-rate incentive is there.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","","You\u2019ve talked about, I guess such a incremental increase in export capacity of about 85,000 barrels a day, and you\u2019ve talked about 20,000 of that being at Ferndale, the other 65,000 barrels a day, where do you see the opportunity for incremental exports.","Greg C. Garland","So really we still look at the Gulf Coast as really the region where we would see the logical place for export given proximity to markets, and the access. So the West Coast is going to be more incremental for us, but the primary bulk of that change will come in our three Gulf Coast refineries.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Switching the topic to Sweeny, I guess your historical relationship with Seaway, I assume there is good access there, should we think about Sweeny feedstock making a step function improvement with this incremental phase, as Seaway come in online in the first quarter of \u201813.","Greg C. Garland","Today Sweeny on our light unit, we are running shale crudes today, and this is just about a question of which particular grades make the most sense from refinery. So I actually think Sweeny is in really good shape, and it really depends upon the economic substitution that we have for the heavier piece of the units. So you\u2019re right, Sweeny is in a great location, only from Seaway, but when you think about it very good access to South Texas crudes particularly the Eagle Ford crudes, and that\u2019s where the emphasis has been to this point.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Thank you.","Greg C. Garland","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys.","Greg C. Garland","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","You noted that you\u2019re backing out light sweet crude in the fourth quarter in the Gulf Coast and it\u2019s only a matter of time for the Gulf Coast industry in making various midstream investments around that, I mean are you considering any consign splitter or hardware investment versus midstream taking advantage of that growing and impending a lot of light crude, and then somewhat related, I mean do you see your ship assets competing with rail, they are going to providing you just more option out of East Coast or do you see a high utilization or kind of purposeful or kind of both, what I would say, kind of more leased out assets?","Greg C. Garland","So, yeah \u2013 I\u2019d take in reverse order, we like the flexibility of rail and ship to move clearly, we think there is a cost advantage, and moving marine versus rail, but the opportunity to acquire, to transact vessels is limited, so that\u2019s one of the reasons we move quickly on these two ships that we took, and yes we would consider an investment, I think that we\u2019d want to see, where the spreads really go where LOS really ends up. We\u2019re still kind of quoting $2 to $3 a barrel differential on LOS, it\u2019s not a big investment for us, but frankly we still have higher returning projects. We think we can invest in, but we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to make that investment if the economics wanted it, but we\u2019ve got a lot of \u2013 I would say small quick type investments we can do in refining that are 30% and 40% return project, that you\u2019ll see it too, that help push yields, drive cost down, and improve access.","So you\u2019ll see us do those things, but we\u2019re not in a bit hurry to make an investment and condensate for them.","Greg G. Maxwell","We still have additional capacity to penetrate without that so that\u2019s our first priority and then, as we get beyond that point that\u2019s where I thing you\u2019ll be able to think about it that we need to do something else in the process side. Yeah?","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, let me shift gears to some of those other projects on the chemical side, a few question, now you could help me with the potential EBITDA uplift based on assumed margin levels from Sweeny fractionation expansion this year? And secondly, help me understand better maybe this normal also Olefins\u2019s expansion project exceed volume kind of value add gentle impact there?","Greg C. Garland","Yeah, go ahead.","Timothy G. Taylor","This is Tim. It\u2019s couple of comments on the Sweeny fraction, it\u2019s a debottleneck and the real value comes from increased volume throughput at the fractionation that feeds the cracking complex there. But probably more importantly, it allows more ethane into the mix, and she capture value that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a relatively modest project in terms of capital of $100 million, and I would expect returns well above 20% on that.","So incrementally it\u2019s a very attractive project, it\u2019s just not the same scale as you expect with the cracker.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sure.","Timothy G. Taylor","So makes a lot of sense. On the NAO the project there you think about, we\u2019ve got the (inaudible) announced that separate from an announcement, that\u2019s a 250,000 ton increment. And what they are looking at with NAO is a debottleneck and expansion of the existing NAO unit there at [Shigar Valley] as well. So again not a major new derivatives complex, but really debottlenecking what\u2019s there on the NAO side, so similar, I would expect that to be similar to what we talk about with the frack.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Similar side investment you mean?","Timothy G. Taylor","Yeah, and I doubt, that\u2019s all very preliminary. So I think it\u2019s very early in that stage, but again it\u2019s a relatively modest increase versus a major new plan.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Maybe last if I could speak one more on just on rails to kind of get back to the piggyback refining. I mean I know you have 2000 railcars layering in number one, what\u2019s the kind of how we should we think about the delivery of that rail fleet, is it all general purpose on unique oil, and how do you think about in this kind of rail gold rush really, how do you consider translating investments around your systems drive optionality or is this a primarily at this juncture a Bakken, the East Coast to Bakken transit?","Greg C. Garland","It\u2019s a great question. So these are general purpose cars, although we will say that we are looking at coil steel cars to move Canadian heavy down to the West Coast in addition to this. So as you think about this, it was originally envisioned as a Bakken play to go east and west without question, where we are investing in the infrastructure is our refineries for unloading if you will and we are using third party access in the Bakken itself. I don\u2019t think we see the need to invest in terms of loading facilities in the Bakken at this point in time. And frankly, when I think about the railcars is, they can move over time as the opportunity moves, but our view is that the next five year window Bakken crudes will probably move a lot of it by rail on east and west.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I agree. What do you think that permitting track is for California rail, that\u2019s going to take a long time, do you have any\u2026?","Greg C. Garland","Yeah, which, I knew the answer to that one. I think we are pushing in. I think there is some resistance giving the heavy nature of the crudes in the carbon footprint of crudes and AB32, a carbon cap-and-trade etcetera in California, but I think it\u2019s an opportunity to certainly its worth of exploring.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Thanks fellows. Good morning. Follow-up I guess on a couple of questions been asked, particularly on the West Coast of the Western Pacific to be more exact. If you look at your earnings now the full year is in, late last year you\u2019ve had $84 million adjusted versus $3.5 billion for the whole system, this year it looks about $300 million on $5.2 billion for the whole system. I\u2019m just kind of curious as to strategically how you\u2019re thinking about that part of your business on a go-forward basis, given that it seems to be somewhat challenge if everything else is going on the portfolio, that\u2019s my first question and I have a follow-up please.","Greg C. Garland","","Okay. Hi, Doug. So the West Coast well, we talked about Melaka, so I think we kind of answer the Melaka piece of it from a specific standpoint. It\u2019s not strategic for us non-core asset. California is a challenge place to operate, its high-cost environment, there is a lot of things coming at us in California. It\u2019s net income positive, its cash positive, and its single-digit returns. And so it doesn\u2019t fit the return profile that we see long-term in the business.","So what are we doing? We\u2019re doing everything we can to improve it. So it\u2019s looking at our costs, it\u2019s looking at our configuration, it\u2019s looking how do we get advantage crudes into these refineries to improve and at same time, I would say we\u2019re studying all options for California in terms of where do we go long-term with the California asset. I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a distress that, I don\u2019t think we have to move tomorrow on it, but also think that we want to take our time and be thoughtful and make sure that whatever we do in California creates value to our Phillips 66 shareholders.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Thanks for that. My follow-up is actually a related question, not to try and predict what happens next, but could you help us understand what kind of inventory you have tied up across the first two parts of the portfolio I guess Melaka and the West Coast? And maybe there has been a little bit of talk there about at some point in next few years, we might see some accounting changes as it relates to the accounting for \u2013 LIFO accounting for inventory. What kind of cash tax liability might you have, or what kind of cash could be released from inventory if you decided to put them on the monetization, I will leave it there? Thanks.","Greg C. Garland","Okay, Greg?","Greg G. Maxwell","Yeah, Doug, this is Greg Maxwell. We watch this from an inventory perspective and look at the different pieces of legislation that are coming out. From a replacement cost perspective over and above what we have recorded on our books on the inventory level basis, it\u2019s about \u2013 runs about $7.5 billion to $8 billion.","And so one other things that we saw in the legislation that would be paid over a 10-year period is the latest we have seen on it. So basically you could look at the gain on that divided by 10 times, 35% sort of give you a rough estimate of what the cash taxes would be on an annual basis.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","And if you choose to monetize your inventory not just on, can you quantify what that would be?","Greg C. Garland","Are you talking about just California?","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Yeah\u2026","Greg C. Garland","I\u2019m sorry Doug. I\u2019m talking about the entire system. I don\u2019t think\u2026","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Sure, sure. I\u2019m trying to think more like, what kind of value would be released, for example, you decided to go down to monetization on those assets?","Greg C. Garland","I guess if you\u2019re looking for kind of a broad number, we say 20% of it.","Greg G. Maxwell","Yeah.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Terrific. That sounds great, guys. Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil Incorporated","Yes, good morning. Congratulations on the results. I had a question for you on debt. Obviously, it was reduced by about $1 billion this quarter. As I understood the large portion of the debt balance actually contained a fairly low interest rate and that was one of the things I think at the initial analyst we had up in New York, you were grappling with Greg as far as, do you pay that down, or how did you manage the balance sheet going forward? I\u2019m just curious from here. Is your buyers do kind of leave the dead levels where they are, and just distribute the remaining amount to shareholders, or may be just build additional cash or any thoughts there appreciated.","Greg G. Maxwell","","Right, thanks for the question. So we said at the Analyst Day that we\u2019re going to pay down $2 billion of the debt, so we\u2019re going to go from a $8 billion to $6 billion that takes us to about a 20%, which is a lower end of the range. That\u2019s still, the plan is to pay down another $1 billion of the debt, there\u2019s no question its very attractive financing.","But as we work, we always like to remind people what it is, always will be a volatile business. And that\u2019s life in the commodity business and we accept that, we think that we are comfortable operating that space. But I think you want to have a balance sheet that supports that. So it reduces risk for the company, in our view it creates capacity. We\u2019re not going to hesitate to lever back, that if we have to, to continue our plans, or pay dividends, or do the things that we need to do.","And, but no question our view is that, the next couple of years midcycle margins are going to be evolved, historical midcycle margins I think, we\u2019re going to have cash optionality. So I think, you\u2019ll see us one pay a dividend, continue to increase that dividend, you\u2019ll see us then use excess cash to take in shares and we aren\u2019t going to take specials off the table.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil Incorporated","Great, thanks. And then second one was really more I guess big picture capital allocation oriented, but as I look at the return on the capital employed in your slides, it looks like the R&M numbers moved up to 22%, which is equivalent to what you are getting in the midstream. I guess as you make decisions on allocating capital going forward, as I understood R&M was really going to be one of the smaller pieces of the portfolio going forward. I\u2019m just curious this is blowout and returns in the downstream kind of change that theory going forward?","Greg C. Garland","So my view is that, refining historically has been kind of a 10% to 12% business let\u2019s say. We think we have plans in place to advantage crude capture, yields, cost reduction, that we can move it 400 basis points. So it\u2019s a 15% business going forward for us versus a 30% return business in Chemicals. And probably Midstream business 15% to 17% returns is kind of what we\u2019re looking in fact.","So, to the extent that we have 30% and 40% return projects in refining, we\u2019re going to do those. I think, I mean we do get challenged by people all the time or we under investing in refining. At this point, we don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any opportunities out there, we feel that we\u2019ve missed in terms of an investment opportunity in the refining space.","Our focus is going to be very disciplined. We\u2019re going to restrict capital in this space. We\u2019re going to improve returns in this space. And so we don\u2019t see a change required in our strategy at this point in time.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil Incorporated","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks?","Greg C. Garland","Great, thanks. Well, we appreciate the interest in the company and the questions. And if there are follow-up questions, obviously Rosy and I are available to handle those. And you can find this information and a transcript of the call on our website in the near future. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is Julie, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.","Jeff Dietert - Phillips 66","Welcome to the Phillips 66 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Participants on today's call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; Tim Taylor, President; Kevin Mitchell, Executive Vice President and CFO.","The presentation material we will be using during the call can be found on our Investor Relations section of our Phillips 66 website along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide two contains our Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our Q&A session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg Garland for opening remarks.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Okay. Jeff. Thank you. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During the quarter, the Gulf Coast region was impacted by Hurricane Harvey. We're very proud of how our employees responded to the challenges caused by this storm. They did extraordinary things to help their families, friends, and neighbors, and they worked to safeguard our assets and communities. Through these efforts we were able to ensure critical energy products were supplied to first responders, businesses and consumers.","For the third quarter, adjusted earnings were $858 million, or $1.66 per share. Our Refining utilization rate was 98% for the quarter. We operated well across our Refining system. Utilization for Atlantic Basin and West Coast regions exceeded 100%. Our Gulf Coast region ran at 93%, reflecting hurricane impacts at Sweeny. Our Chemicals businesses, on the other hand, was challenged due to extended downtime related to the storm.","In advance of the hurricane, operations were shut-in at several of our Gulf Coast facilities where we have Refining, Chemical and Midstream assets. In early September, we started up many of these assets, including facilities at Sweeny, which were back to full operations by mid-September. Our Lake Charles and Alliance refineries ran through the storm with minimal operational issues. Our employees worked through the logistical challenges to get crude in our refineries and ensured products were getting out to market. Additionally, in Midstream we took operations down at the Pasadena, Beaumont and Freeport terminals. These facilities all resumed operations in early September.","Our most significant impact was in Chemicals at the CPChem Cedar Bayou facility in Baytown, Texas. Cedar Bayou received 60 inches of rain it poured 8 feet (3:19) of water in various locations within the facility. A phase start-up of operations is underway with most units expected to be online by the end of November. We remain focused on executing our strategy. We're committed to operating safely, reliably and in an environmentally responsible manner. We demonstrated this commitment during the storm and the aftermath.","We have also made progress this quarter advancing key growth and return projects. In Midstream, we continue to invest in the Beaumont Terminal to increase our storage and export capabilities. We're building additional 3.5 million barrels of crude storage, which is expected to be in service by the end of 2018. We're also expanding the terminal's export facilities from 400,000 barrels a day to 600,000 barrels a day. This is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2018.","Earlier this month, we contributed in Merey Sweeny and our 25% interest in the Bakken pipeline to Phillips 66 partners in a $2.4 billion transaction. This is the largest acquisition to-date for PSXP. PSXP is well positioned to achieve its goal of $1.1 billion run rate adjusted EBITDA by the end 2018.","DCP Midstream is increasing the Sand Hills NGL pipeline capacity from 280,000 barrels a day to 365,000 barrels a day and is expected to be in service by the end of the year. DCP plans to further expand the capacity to 450,000 barrels a day in the second half of 2018. Sand Hills is owned two-thirds by DCP and one-third by Phillips 66 partners.","Also, DCP continues to focus on expansions in high-growth basins. The Mewbourn 3 gas processing plant is being constructed in the DJ basin, is expected to start up in the fourth quarter 2018. Also in the DJ, the O'Conner 2 gas processing plant is scheduled to be complete in 2019. In the Permian Basin, DCP plans to jointly develop the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline to link natural gas production to markets along the Texas Gulf Coast.","In Chemicals, CPChem started up two new 1.1 billion pound per year polyethylene units. Through the impacts of Hurricane Harvey, we now expect commissioning of the new Cedar Bayou ethane cracker to begin in the first quarter of 2018. Together these assets will increase CPChem's global ethylene and polyethylene capacity by approximately one-third.","In Refining, we're progressing return projects to include proved clean product yields. A diesel recovery project in the Ponca City Refinery is on track to start up in the fourth quarter. We're modernizing FCC units at both the Bayway and Wood River Refineries. We expect these projects to be completed in the first half of 2018.","Financial discipline, with an emphasis on returns, and prudent capital allocation is fundamental to our strategy. We're further lowering our 2017 capital expenditures guidance to about $2 billion. During the quarter, we returned over $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Earlier in October, our board approved a new $3 billion share repurchase program. The new program increases the company's total share repurchase authorizations to $12 billion since 2012.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financials.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Thank you, Greg. Let's start with an overview on slide four. Third quarter earnings were $823 million. We had special items that netted to a loss of $35 million. The largest of which was $44 million of after tax hurricane-related costs. After excluding these items, adjusted earnings were $858 million or $1.66 per share.","Excluding a negative working capital impact of $195 million, cash from operations was $596 million. This also reflected the impact of a $390 million discretionary contribution to the pension plan in the quarter. Capital spending for the quarter was $367 million with $209 million spent on growth projects. Distributions to shareholders in the third quarter consisted of $356 million in dividends and $461 million in share repurchases. We finished the quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 27%. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 33%. Annualized adjusted year-to-date return on capital employed was 8%.","Slide five compares third quarter and second quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings increased by $289 million, driven by improvements in Refining, partially offset by lower Chemicals results.","Slide six shows our Midstream results. Transportation-adjusted net income for the quarter was $98 million, up $24 million from the prior quarter. The increase was due to a full quarter of commercial operations on the Bakken pipeline. In addition, we had higher crude oil throughput volumes due to high utilization at refineries integrated with our Midstream assets.","In NGL, the $14 million decrease from the prior quarter was largely due to hurricane impacts on fractionation and export volumes. DCP Midstream had adjusted net income of $1 million in the third quarter. The $12 million decrease from the second quarter was due to the impact of rising NGL prices on forward hedges, as well as $6 million of asset impairments. After removing non-controlling interests of $32 million, Midstream's third quarter adjusted earnings were $67 million, $3 million higher than the second quarter.","Turning to Chemicals on slide seven, third quarter adjusted earnings for the segment were $153 million, $43 million lower than the second quarter. In Olefins and Polyolefins, adjusted earnings decreased by $42 million, primarily due to lower margins and volumes from hurricane-related downtime, which resulted in 83% utilization. The earnings impact from low utilization was somewhat mitigated by inventory drawdown during the quarter. Adjusted earnings for SA&S increased by $1 million, as higher equity earnings resulting from less unplanned downtime, was mostly offset by lower margins.","In Refining, crude utilization was 98% for the quarter, consistent with the second quarter. Pre-tax turnaround costs were $43 million, $111 million lower than the second quarter. Clean product yield was 85%, consistent with the prior quarter. Realized margin was $10.49 per barrel, up from $8.44 per barrel last quarter.","The chart on slide eight provides a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings. In total, the Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $548 million, a $315 million improvement from last quarter. This increase was driven by improved margins in all regions and lower turnaround costs.","Adjusted earnings in the Atlantic Basin were $172 million, up $63 million from the second quarter. The increase was primarily driven by a 25% improvement in the market crack during the third quarter.","The Gulf Coast adjusted earnings improved $21 million during the quarter, due to the higher market crack. Partially offset by lower clean product utilizations and lower volumes. The lower utilizations resulted from the rise in prices relative to the timing of pipeline shipments and Sweeny refinery downtime during the highest margin period of the quarter.","Adjusted earnings in the central corridor were $198 million, up $169 million from the previous quarter. The increase was driven by a 42% improvement in the market crack as well as lower turnaround costs and higher volumes as the Billings refinery completed a turnaround in the second quarter.","In the West Coast, adjusted earnings improved $62 million over the previous quarter. The increase was primarily due to the higher distillate crack.","Slide nine covers market capture. The 321 market crack for the quarter was $18.19 per barrel compared to $14.06 per barrel in the first quarter. Our realized margin for the third quarter was $10.49 per barrel resulting in an overall market capture of 58%, down slightly from 60% in the prior quarter. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries. During the third quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack.","Losses from secondary products of $2.10 per barrel were lower than the previous quarter due to improved NGL and fuel oil prices relative to crude. Feedstock advantage improved realized margins by $0.62 per barrel, which was consistent with the prior quarter. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. This category reduced realized margins by $3.20 per barrel compared with $1.30 per barrel in the prior quarter, mainly due to Gulf Coast clean product realizations and higher RINs costs.","Let's move to Marketing and Specialties on slide 10. Adjusted third quarter earnings were $211 million, $7 million lower than the second quarter. In Marketing and Other, the $22 million decrease in adjusted earnings was largely due to lower realized margins. We continue to see volume uplift from our reimaging program with a 3% year-over-year improvement in gasoline sales at our reimage sites.","Specialties' adjusted earnings were $48 million, an increase of $15 million over the prior quarter, mainly due to higher equity earnings from the Excel Paralubes joint venture, driven by higher utilization.","On slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted tax-tax net costs of $121 million this quarter compared to $142 million in the prior quarter. The $21 million decrease in net costs was primarily due to tax adjustments.","Slide 12 shows the changing cash during the year. We entered the year with $2.7 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations for the first three quarters was about $2.6 billion. Working capital changes decreased cash flow by about $900 million, primarily due to inventory bills.","Year-to-date, we funded approximately $1.3 billion of capital expenditures and investments and distributed $2.2 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 507 million shares outstanding and our cash balance was $1.5 billion.","This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next I'll cover a few outlook items. In the fourth quarter in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the high 70%s due to continued downtime at CPChem Cedar Bayou facility. We expect most of the units to be online by the end of November.","In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and pre-tax turnaround expenses to be between $100 million and $130 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $125 million and $145 million after tax. In December, we will provide further details on our 2018 capital program.","With that, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning, team.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Good morning.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Good morning.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Greg or Kevin. I want to start on the $2 billion to $3 billion capital spending range for 2018. Very wide range kind of in line with our expectations. But given the fact that you've lowered 2017 capital spend, is it fair to assume that we should think that you're going to be erring on the lower end of that range? And recognizing that you're going to provide more color here in a couple weeks?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes, I mean, Neil, thanks for the question. So someone said that's wide enough you could drive a truck through it. But it's been very consistent with the last couple of years we've been saying $1 billion sustaining capital and $1 billion to $2 billion of growth capital, and $1 billion to $2 billion of share repurchase. So we go to the board in early December on our capital budget, and I certainly don't want to front run that. But what I would tell you in terms of capital, we still expect we're going to be on the high end of that range. In terms of share repurchase, we don't expect we're going to be on the low end of that range.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Understood. Understood. On Chemicals, can you talk about Cedar Bayou, just in terms of project and service? I think you said by the end of November and what's left to be done mechanically there, and then again can you reiterate the targets for the end of the first quarter for the new chemical capacity to come online for next year?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Hi, Neil. It's Tim Taylor. In terms of the operating units at Cedar Bayou, we've gotten our first unit back up in operation in mid-October. It's the 1-hexene unit, which is a very critical component for polyethylene manufacturing globally. And we've done that. We're getting utilities back up as we speak. And we would anticipate that the cracker should be up by mid-November. And then there's a couple of polyethylene units that will come up maybe in early December. So essentially by mid-November, we expect to have most of that complex back up. And it's really around making sure the instrumentation that was wet is functional, replacing that, motors, those kinds of things. So it tend to be a lot more electrical work in terms of the repair on the facility. And as you might guess, bringing back electrical power substations and switchgear for that.","A similar story around the cracker. There's two things going on the new cracker at Cedar Bayou. One, there was a need to repair some of the instruments and the motors that are associated with the new cracker. That's ongoing as well. But in conjunction with that, we've continued to work on completing the mechanical part of that. And that's gone well as well. So we've been able to pull the progress forward like we had hoped on both of those, and so the mechanical completion in the first quarter on the start-up looks in terms of feed in, we're still confident that we can hit that date and that really puts us I think in the full commercial operation on new cracker in the second quarter.","So, more to come as we go through that, but we have been pleased with the progress that everyone on the team out there has made in terms of their commitment, the organization and getting it done, and getting that unit back in operation.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, Greg. More positive dynamics in many ways in Refining. Are you cheering up about it at all? I know you've been pretty resolutely determined not to increase any spending. Firstly, I was wondering is there any potential maybe on the strength for you to think harder about leaving California, which you might have talked about in the past. And then secondly, can you see a structurally better argument for the industry right now? Thanks.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes, so Paul, I would tell you, we're more constructive on refining for 2018. Certainly if you think back to 2016, coming into 2017, we were pretty negative. But we've seen the inventory clear out with the hurricanes, fundamentally demand is pretty good. We're in the turnaround season now and in the first quarter. So I think we're \u2013 our view is we're starting to be at mid-cycle or better in terms of cracks in 2018, and so we're pretty positive around that environment.","The other thing I would just say is across the portfolio, we're pretty happy with the portfolio. You get frustrated from time to time with California and what goes on there, but still reasonably good assets, well positioned, generating good cash for us. And so I don't think you'll see us doing things with the California assets in the near term.","And then fundamentally, I think about 2018 for us, we're coming off of kind of peak capital spending, we've got the new assets coming on, so we really are hitting the pivot point in terms of free cash flow generation for us with new cash coming from the \u2013 assets coming on and reduced capital expenditures. So I think I'm pretty constructive about 2018.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","And I guess, are you guys still relatively long distillate? I think that's always been the historic case. I wondered if others have kind of caught up with you.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","So I think that's true. I think that when you look at our portfolio, how we're configured, we do like distillate because we make a lot of it.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes, and then could I just follow up did you just \u2013 forgive me if I missed this \u2013 did you just address \u2013 actually, I'll tell you what. I'll ask it a different way. One of the things that's happening with CapEx is that it's coming down on costs and we've heard actually ConocoPhillips say that one of the issues was that people have kind of tapped the brakes in the U.S. E&P and I can understand how that would temper costs. But it's not clear to me with relatively tight labor markets and ongoing expansions in chemicals, how the costs have come down so successfully given the scale of labor. Labor is part of the overall budgets there. Could you just talk a little bit about where the benefits and the cost benefits have come for you guys? Thanks.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Well, I think in terms of costs and construction costs, I'm not sure we've seen a big decrease yet. I think as the E&P's tap the brakes that will free up some capacity. But there's still a ton of petrochemical going on, on the U.S. Gulf Coast. And so that obviously plays into that. But I don't think we've seen it.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","My understanding was that your CapEx could come down again. And I guess it's got a very wide range because of that cost uncertainty. Is that fair because of the lower cost certainty.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes, Paul. So I would say, so the CapEx coming down is a function of a couple things. One is we're kind of through that big push in terms of the big projects we've been doing. And then led by you and others, I think there's an important conversation going on, on growth and returns in the upstream business. And as we look at what's going on out there, we see a lot of return challenge projects. And part of our reduction in capital this year has been around the delay of the frac decision. But it's also around some projects that we've just chosen not to proceed with that we had laid in the plan because they didn't meet our return hurdle requirements. So I think you had that dynamic going on too.","And then everyone's looking at the Permian. And in a $40, $60 world it seems to make sense. But everyone sees the opportunity, and so there's a lot of people chasing the volumes coming out of the Permian. And you just look at those returns, and those are tough returns, particularly in the Midstream space.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Thanks, Greg. Have a good weekend.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","You too. Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Hey, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Greg, I wonder if you can give us an update on the thoughts on CPChem going to cracker 2. Obviously we're seeing some swings in the dividend distribution, it looks like. And I'm just curious if the appetite on both partners is the same to move forward and when you might expect to hear about it.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","So I would tell you that, I mean we are advancing the next project. We're doing engineering work on it. We haven't agreed on a date for the FID for that project. But I'm guessing it's sometime late 2019, 2020 would be the appropriate time on that, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So just to be clear. That would be funded at the CPChem level. In other words, that would obviously impact distributions.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Correct.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Doug, it depends a bit on the capital structure. They have the ability, clearly, great credit rating. And they have the ability to help finance those projects. And so I think that's the other variable to distribution policy. But I think both owners want to see distributions continue, yet we have to do that in the most capital-efficient way. The only other comment I'd add on that too is that CPChem continues to look outside the U.S. for opportunities as well. And so I think there's a number of things that they're looking at beyond just a U.S. Gulf Coast cracker for the second project.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I appreciate that, Tim. Thank you. My follow up, Greg, is kind of a bit of a convoluted question, I guess. Before we had the export ban lifted on crude oil, the whole industry seemed to pivot to take advantage of what seemed to be something of a structural crude spread. I realize it's there now, but I don't think, I guess there was a debate over how wide that remains.","But my point is, or my question is rather, that as you see pricing exports really ramp up in the U.S. from the Gulf Coast, pricing in Gulf Coast crude, light sweet crude seems to be linking more to Brent than to WTI, let's say. So I'm just curious. Does that change the dynamics of your crude slate? Do you see more challenged pricing coming from that shift towards lighter sweet crude? Or do you think it just kind of washes out? I'm just curious on your perception. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I'll let Tim take it.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Doug, as we think about it, you're right. The Gulf Coast much more linked to Brent because you've got the opportunity for imports as well as exports. What's interesting right now is the pull on WTI and more the inland crudes to make it there to the export market. And so we've actually seen some infrastructure bottlenecks that probably get alleviated, but probably speak to a wider WTI Brent, a little wider than we would have expected probably over the last year. In terms of crude slate, I think from our perspective, it certainly in the mid-con WTI's advantage versus Brent, that's a positive for that. I think on the coastal regions it just increases your optionality if you're looking at light crudes to import or to use U.S. crude.","So I think the world is just kind of rebalancing about what's the optimum crude on the light side. We haven't seen much of an economic incentive to really change between light and heavy. And so it will take a lot more differential to drive that. So I think it's really been more about crude choices and I think the world is sorting out where is the best destination for the different crude types that become available. But the coastal regions are just much more competitive on that, from that basis.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tim, can you offer a perspective on what's keeping TI Brent so wide as it stands today?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","I think to us, A, the hurricane costs and disruptions in terms of export capability, we've seen really strong exports out of the U.S. And with that disconnect, there's a need to try and move that WTI, particularly from Cushing and other areas down into the export market. And that space has just really become more valuable. So I think the response has been that the transportation cost to get it there has gone up, and that's led to a wider differential, that probably comes in over time as that gets debottlenecked, but it looks structurally \u2013 as we think about the demand export pull, we think that leads to a bit wider WTI Brent, but probably not in the range that we're seeing today. It should be tighter.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","So TI has been weaker but Brent's been stronger.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yeah.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I think that's part of the formula, too. And I think when we think about the fourth quarter turnarounds, et cetera, we're probably $4 to $6 on that spread. But I don't think that's sustainable long-term. I think as you get into 2018 and some of the infrastructure, you get normalization in the markets. We're still thinking long-term that that spread is something under $4.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yeah.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, fellows. I look forward to seeing you in December. Thanks.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Okay. Take care.","Operator","Phil Gresh from JPMorgan, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Hi. First question is, as you kind of have this more muted capital spending outlook on a go-forward basis, do you think that there's opportunities out there from an M&A perspective, from a capital allocation standpoint, or as you look at the returns of M&A, is it equally as challenging as what you're talking about with some of the organic opportunities?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Valuations still look high to us. So I do think that \u2013 particularly if you look at the Midstream space, you have a lot of folks that are highly levered, high yield, high cost of capital, trying to compete out there. So I do think there's going to be some consolidation coming in the Midstream space. So we'll see how that plays out. But when you look at some of the assets have changed hands at 20 times, it's just hard to see how you create value doing that for your shareholders.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure. Okay. Second question for Kevin, just on the cash flow statement, there's some moving pieces this quarter, lower deferred taxes, some headwinds from equity affiliates. If you could just maybe elaborate on those and talk about your outlook, especially on deferred tax, since it was such a high number in the first half of the year.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yeah Phil, so on deferred taxes, a lot of that benefit that we had been recognizing reflected the assets going into service this year and the impact of bonus depreciation which for this year is 50% year one depreciation. With the start-up of the cracker being pushed into the first quarter of 2018, we have backed off of that recognizing that benefit in 2017. And so what you saw in the third quarter was a reversal of what we had recognized year-to-date for depreciation on the cracker. And so I think when you get to the fourth quarter, you'll still \u2013 you'll see some deferred tax tailwind again.","In the third quarter, it was essentially zero as the reversal offset the other positive impacts there. And then on a go-forward basis, you would normally expect given the couple of billion dollars of capital expenditures and the profile of the tax depreciation, you'd normally expect some degree of benefit from a deferred tax standpoint. And just as a reminder, bonus depreciation, 2018 assets placed in service, that first year depreciation is 40%. It drops from 50% to 40%. In 2019, it drops to 30%. And then you have the normal makers depreciation on top of that. So expect to see some, a resumption to a more normal level of deferred tax benefit in future periods.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Very helpful. And then just on working capital, you've had a pretty big usage year-to-date. Is that something you expect some reversal \u2013 normalization from the storms or anything like that in the fourth quarter?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yes, you will. And the big piece of the drag year-to-date on working capital has been associated with inventory build. And so you can expect to see some of that come back in the fourth quarter as is usually the case. Typically don't see the full cash benefit of that in the fourth quarter because some of it carries over into the first quarter. But I would expect to see some of that come back in the fourth quarter.","The other item, I'm just thinking back to your original question, was around distributions, and so lower distributions from equity affiliates in the third quarter. The big impact there was CPChem. So we had good distributions in the second quarter, nothing in the third quarter, and we're not expecting anything in the fourth quarter given that their focus is on bringing the Cedar Bayou back up, and the new cracker. And so anticipating slightly less distributions than we would have for the year. But as you look forward into 2018, you would think with CPChem, with the CapEx coming down, the incremental cash flow from the new project.","So I'd expect CPChem distributions to be $600 million to $800 million for the year, somewhere in that range to us. And then you've got DCP distributions coming at a \u2013 they're not as significant, but a reasonable rate, probably $100 million to $150 million, little bit out of WRB. So I think that undistributed equity earnings on the cash statement will come down a little bit in 2018 relative to where it's been in this year and prior years.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. It's very helpful. And did you mention something about Colonial Pipeline timing in your opening remarks on the Gulf Coast for refining?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yeah, I did. And that was in the context of price realization, actual price realizations relative to the marker benchmark price in terms of the way that pricing mechanism works relative to timing of when volumes go into the pipeline. So that's a phenomenon we often see in the Gulf Coast. It's all the timing effects.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Paul Cheng from Barclays, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Good morning, Paul.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Hey, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon. Several questions, on the hurricane, once that the \u2013 well, first of all then, can you quantify for us how big is the total cost and opportunity cost in the third quarter? And what that may look like in the fourth quarter? Is there any estimate that you can provide?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yes, Paul. This is Kevin. I mean, we broke out the actual costs associated with the hurricane. We haven't given a specific margin impact. I mean, you can kind of get there from the utilization and the volume variances that we've given. As you look forward into the fourth quarter in Chemicals, the way we see this, so you've got close to two months of downtime and repair activity in the fourth quarter compared to a month in the third quarter. So the cost element of that is going to be higher. So pre-tax, our share of the CPChem costs was $53 million in the third quarter. It's going to be north of that. It could be double that in the fourth quarter. But consistent with the third quarter, we'll special item treat that. So from an underlying basis, that won't impact the noise.","And then the other element is going to be on volumes in Chemicals. So we guided to high 70% utilization. And one way to kind of think about that and rationalize it, Cedar Bayou is about a third of domestic O&P production for CPChem. So you've got a third of that production offline for two-thirds of the quarter, and you get to that kind of 20% impact on utilization.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And, Tim, once the \u2013 do you think cracker is start-up. How long you take before you ramp to the full production? What kind of expectation there should we use?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yes, I think if you \u2013 let's say, ethane at the end of the first quarter, you're still on the commissioning piece of that. Normally barring any equipment things, 30 to 60 days really would be kind of the expectation to shake down and make sure that all the instrumentation and the controls are tuned. So you should see a ramp-up over the quarter. But by mid-year, if we do that, you would expect it to run at design capacity.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","So, Paul, I would just point out with the new polyethylene capacity, Sweeny is already running.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yeah.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","So just think about the total balance in the system. As we get the polyethylene back up at Cedar, I think that we plan to get up pretty quick, and we plan to be running at capacity for the new project.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Tim, is there any turnaround activities because of Harvey being pushed into 2018?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","No, we've, Ponca City is in a turnaround right now. We really haven't pushed turnarounds. We're sticking with our schedule. So we gave some guidance on that. But nothing unusual as a response to Harvey.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And two final questions. One is on the NGL, the business. I mean, even after we adjust for the special items and all that, it's still pretty disappointing from a financial performance standpoint other than, say, the commodity market becoming better, is there anything internally that the company can do in turn in order to get much better, or that is really waiting for the commodity market to turn? And then the final question is I'm curious that with the IMO 2020, is there any large or reasonably large refining capital project that you guys have in mind?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Okay. So I'll take the LPG, Paul. So you're right, there's the market, and it's a tight market. Propane is very dear in the U.S. and that's the market fundamental. I think that's just something that we're working through. In terms of what we have done is we've actually got the frac rate now up to the 100,000 design rate. We're loading the capability now to do 10 cargos a month. And so I think you work on the volume side that's clearly not sufficient.","And then we continue to work on how to improve the cost, right. The logistics costs for all the products that we do, and so we're making progress on that. So I think we look at that and say let's work the commercial terms, let's work the cost side, and let's just make sure that we run efficiently. And then we'll keep pulling away at the market piece. But that's really the focus both particularly on the commercial side in terms of the contracting side and how we go about that.","So I think that's what we do in this case, and we look out and we look at our NGL pipes are doing quite well. We're going to expand those. So we see that extra NGL supply coming. And I think those exports are going to continue to grow, and that's the market change that you're waiting to see. But in the interim, you have to continue to work on trying to improve those results through the things that you can control.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Tim, how big is the opportunity you see or that you guys are hoping to get in terms of improving the margins or improving the costs?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Well, maybe one way to think about that is $0.05 a gallon for us on that is probably on the terminal is about $100 million, and I think realistically you're looking for something in that range of $0.05, maybe slightly less, to try and drive that improvement on a short-term basis.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And in terms of the IMO 2020, any kind of capital investment that you guys have in mind on the refining side related to that?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes, Paul, so we kind of looked at that. And I know there's a lot of exuberance in the industry around the spec change, and I think it's probably constructive in terms of diesel cracks, but I don't think it's going to be enough that it would incent us to make an investment. So, right now, we have no plans to really invest anything around our assets in terms of that, and we look at the spec change and how it might impact our facilities. It's a little bit of an impact at Ferndale, Wood River, and Bayway and through adjusting the crude slate and just destroying it in the cokers, we can manage that. And then on the upside on \u2013 so it's 3.5 million barrels a day in a 35 million barrel market, it should be constructive. But I think ship owners are going to have options. How they impact that. And so I don't think we're just describing a lot of upside value yet to the IMO spec change in terms of the cracks.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","You bet.","Operator","Blake Fernandez from Scotia Howard Weil, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. Folks, good morning. Kevin, I wanted to go back to the cash flow statement if I could. I just wanted to clarify for one that the discretionary pension contribution, is that embedded in the other line item up in cash provided from operating activities?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yes, Blake, it is. It's in that other \u2013 on the cash flow statement, that's right.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Because when I looked last year, it looks like you had a similar hit in 3Q. I'm not sure if that was the driver. But I guess my question is, is this something that kind of typically occurs on an annual basis or does this kind of contribution defer that kind of payment for some period of time?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","I think you can view what we've done this year as meeting our needs for a period of time in terms of any sort of sizable contributions into the pension plan. We did do a payment in the third quarter of last year, but it was not as big as this one, I think. It was not big enough; I don't think we even called it out in our discussion on cash flow. I think it was something in the order of half of the magnitude. But with this one, we should be good for a little while. I mean, there's still other elements of contribution, including the non-discretionary, but this will take care of most of that for a little while.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it. Okay. And the second question, I'm going to show my ignorance here in the Chemicals business, but I was curious to see the chain margins kind of come down in 3Q. It looks like it's actually lower than where we were in the first half of the year. I guess I thought, or was anticipating, a similar impact to what you see in Refining when you have a hurricane hit and margins expand due to industry downtime. Is there just kind of a lag impact? Or can you give us any sense of where margins are shaking out currently in 4Q?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Just a real quick comment on the margin. The margins in the market still fairly consistent. I think what you're seeing is the impact of the extra cost and the downtime in terms of the CPChem cash cost. And so the indicative margin for the markets are actually \u2013 have slightly improved over the quarter, but fairly consistent in that. If you look at IHS data, roughly in that $0.30 per pound range on the cracking side. So we haven't seen \u2013 we've seen strength in the polyethylene, but we just haven't seen a huge spike with that. But it has been constructive from a market standpoint.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","And, Tim, just to clarify, I would assume that that cost component would obviously normalize lower as the facility comes online, right?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Absolutely.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","All right. Okay. Thank you.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","You bet.","Operator","Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you. Good morning.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Hi, Roger","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess just to follow up really on the Midstream side. I know you're going to be a little hesitant with the CapEx for 2018 still ahead here in the near term, but you mentioned valuations you wouldn't really want to buy anything right here, CapEx maybe if it stays modest, you don't really want to build, but you see the NGL market continuing to grow in terms of volumes. Maybe without going \u2013 getting too specific on frac too, just how are you looking at the best growth opportunities down the line here as we think about 2018 and 2019 in the Midstream area?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Well, certainly exports on the crude, so we're continuing to debottleneck on Beaumont for instance at our terminal storage around that, looking at our refining system on clean products. As we think around the system, we look at ways to increase options on both the products and the crude side. Those are typically smaller projects. On the bigger project side, I'd say there's a lot of activity and a lot of interest.","But what we're seeing is that our customers are kind of deferred their decisions about commitments on pipes as well as this thing as they look at all the opportunities out there. And I think that was \u2013 that's a piece of the lower CapEx. But clearly the midstream opportunity is going to follow the upstream, and so we still see that. But I think we're in a period of a couple of years still that that still shakes out from the upstream side as well. And so I think we're matching the rhythm in terms of the upstream resource. And then we're shifting more to what do we do around our system, and continue to do those projects and those things that support that integrated network.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So that would sound like an environment where margins should get better if the infrastructure starts to get tighter. Is that kind of a reasonable take away there?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Well, that would be \u2013 yeah, I think two things. As Greg pointed out, a lot of competition for infrastructure right now particularly out of the Permian. But, yes, I think you're seeing that today out of the mid-con and you're seeing responses as well. So all those things come together to create the opportunity. But in the end, you need commitments from producers to make those things happen. I think that's the segment where it's most dynamic around the opportunities. So I think we'll continue to look at that from a return standpoint and opportunity standpoint, still see the opportunity, the question is, are the returns there right now that make sense.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then changing gears slightly to CPChem. If you ran inventories down this quarter, presumably either \u2013 I'm sorry, not in this quarter \u2013 in the third quarter. We would expect probably an inventory build in the first half of next year to make up for that. And then specific to the cost that will be borne in the fourth quarter here, is that going to be treated as they were in the third quarter as kind of a called out special item not part of the recurring? I mean, it's a little bit nitty-gritty, but I'm just curious how that's going to roll through.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yes, Roger. It's Kevin. So I think the answer is yes to both. So in terms of inventory, you will see as everything comes back online some rebuild of inventory. So although the utilization will be up, the sales volumes won't quite match because of the inventory build. And then, yes, on the repair costs, those will be special items treated again as we did in the third quarter.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, everyone. Greg, I guess a question on repurchases. There's been a lot of talk on the call about how equity income should improve as the new cracker comes online and so forth. Does that make you feel any differently about the sort of $1 billion to $2 billion range of annual repurchases that you've talked about historically?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Well, I think without question, we're going to generate more free cash flow. Long-term, we're still comfortable with our 60-40 allocation methodology, and so although this year we're closer to 50-50 probably when you look at it. And we'll flex as we need to around that. But long-term I still think the 60-40 is good guidance and appropriate of how we'd like to allocate capital.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Got it. And then switching to PSXP, I think in the past you've talked about how you don't see any need to do anything with the IDRs in the near future. But obviously some of your peers, or more of your peers, have now made that switch. So any updated thoughts there?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Well, I think that we did a very successful financing and you'll hear it close in October. So I think it showed that we still had access to capital market. But I think, long-term, you've got to have the right optimal capital structure. So I think there's a time and a place to address that. But we haven't seen that as a significant issue for us yet. But I think it's certainly a very topical discussion and something that we think about in terms of how you deliver the optimum value for both the general partner and the LP. And so I think you've always got to keep that in mind as you think about IDRs and your capital structure at the MLP.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Thank you.","Operator","Spiro Dounis from UBS Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up on two prior comments. First one, Greg, you mentioned that 20 times valuation multiple which is actually something one of your peers mentioned yesterday as well. So I guess I'm trying to figure out it seems like, when you look at the Midstream MLP public equities, they're a bit challenged right now and yet we hear about deals being done at these elevated levels and just wondering what you think is driving that dislocation between public equity and maybe just these one-off asset deals?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I think the Permian feels a little frothy to me right now, and we'll see where does it shake out. There's a lot of folks chasing those volumes, and so I think they're just out there. We're not going to do a 20 times deal. It's pretty simple. I mean we looked at those deals, and we passed on those deals. It's just hard to create value when you're going to pay 20 times and trade it down to 12 to 15. So we're just not going to do that.","I do think that what this is telling you, though, is returns have to come up in the Midstream space, and so I think we're just on that cusp of \u2013 I think you're going to see people start partnering in Midstream to do projects. And that's kind of the first step. And you'll see people thinking about acquisitions or mergers in that space. And so I think that's kind of the logical order of what we're going to see play out over the next, call it, 15 to 18 months in that Midstream space.","We still think that there's good opportunities in the Permian. We think the volumes are going to flow. I'd tell you \u2013 we haven't said it, but we're still constructive on an additional frac capacity at Sweeny. And whether we get that done late this year or early next year, I think we still feel pretty good about the ability to get that done. You think about kind of DCP through the 66 type of assets and the offerings that we can offer producers there. I still have good confidence in that. But, yes, it's going to be \u2013 we're in a state of flux right now in MLP land, if you want to think about it that way. And a lot of people are going to be challenged. Tim?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yes, I'd just say that at 20 times multiple, you've got to have significant volume growth. So I think people are really thinking that there's going to be large volume growth or they've got some deeper synergies with their existing partner systems. But that's the only way that we could see that you could do that. And from our perspective, there is risk when we look at that.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. No, that makes sense. Appreciate those comments. Second one, staying with the Midstream theme here, just on PSXP hitting that $1.1 billion run rate. Trying to figure out which sort of camp you guys fit in going forward to achieve that target. And I guess one way, Greg, as you mentioned you're sort of within striking distance of it now, but one way to look at it is you're going to blow right past it, and crush it. Or maybe the other way to look at it is you don't want to create an equity issuance overhang on PSXP equity again. So maybe just sort of a nice glidepath to that runway. Which way is maybe closer to how you're looking at it?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I think we've been pretty consistent. We're going to be at $1.1 billion run rate EBITDA at the end of 2018. And certainly I think we have assets in the portfolio, we could blow past through that if we wanted to. But I don't think you'll see us do that. We'll be consistent with the guidance. And as you think about post 2018, I think the market is going to tell us how fast to grow, what top quartile really looks like in that. But the thing we want to emphasize is that we have the portfolio of assets that we can grow at that necessary rate to build value for the unitholders and for the shareholders of PSX.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Makes sense. Appreciate the color. Thanks, everyone.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","You bet.","Operator","Faisel Khan from Citigroup, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. I was just reading about the Phillips 66ers basketball team as I was waiting in the queue, and I thought I saw Tim and Greg on here.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Well, yes, maybe. We're not tall enough.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Fair enough. Neither am I. I just want to go back to one of the \u2013 a couple of comments you made on the LPG side, the $0.05 to $100 million sort of number you threw out there. Was that just on the LPG loading of sort of the uncontracted capacity? Or how were you sort of talking about that number?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Well, what we think about it is: A, is there a thing going shipping rates, are there things on the loading contract. And then there's acquisition costs. We bought on the outside, the propane, so logistics costs around that. Thinking about our product logistics, so we've made success in reducing those costs. So it's a combination of all of the above that you work on and then of course there's always the operating cost of the unit. But I think we're really focused on is how do we work on the product realizations and the purchase realization, and then also the commercial contract side as a way to drive that. But that's what you have to keep working on and trying to increase your spreads in this market.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. So that was like a blended number on the entire integrated complex as a whole?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes. I'm just saying when you take \u2013 when you look at the LPG terminal and you look at the volume and you \u2013 $0.05 a gallon is about $100 million, and that's a target we'd like to put out there. But it's going to take \u2013 it takes a lot of work and, but that's where we'd like to see that go.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Got you. And then just on the bottlenecks you sort of described around Brent TI. Are you seeing right now existing pipeline bottlenecks? I understand all the stuff is left over from the hurricane and from tropical storm, Nate. But was there some sort of existing bottleneck that you're seeing or pointing towards that's telling you that the diffs wide for a reason?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I think if you tried to pick up space on one of the pipes today out of Cushing to the Gulf, you would find that the spot rates are higher. And I think that speaks to that there's just a lot of demand for that movement. And so it's kind of created a market dislocation as a result of that. When you get new pipes, using the Sealy, I mean the Sealy connection sets with Enterprise, some of those will begin to alleviate that. The new pipe order in Memphis will probably start to pull on WTI as well. But I still think, given the export pricing that we're seeing with the strong Brent, you're going to want to move that south. So it's going to be interesting to watch over time just how valuable that pipeline space continues to be.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Gotcha. And then just on the last \u2013 this last financing and dropped the PSXP, I mean, this looks like it solves your runway to growth to $1.1 billion or pretty close to it by the end of next year. So do you actually need to do another deal at all between now and the end of next year and to PSXP?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","So, we do have both organic projects that are maturing to help add to that EBITDA to the $1.1 billion total, and then we have the capability to supplement that with dropdowns. And so we anticipate from an equity standpoint that anything we need we can access through the ATM. But I think this is a market where you try to minimize your access to that to create the most value. So it's a pretty small gap compared to what we had, and so we think it's very achievable at a good accretive return back to the LP.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. And then just last question for me, the year-to-date, the 8% sort of return on capital employed, can you just remind us again what your guys' targets are over the long run and where you want to see that number get to especially with all the projects that are sort of coming to an end here?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Faisel, this is Kevin. Well, at a minimum, we want to see our return on capital above our cost of capital. But as you look \u2013 if you look back historically, we've been across the entire portfolio 11%, 12% kind of level. And that's where we would really expect to see the overall portfolio of assets generating a blended return that gets you back to that range. Obviously we'll always take higher, and you see the different segments are generating different returns across there. But I think you're targeting getting back north of 10% as being a reasonable level to be at.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","You bet.","Operator","Justin Jenkins from Raymond James, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks. I think we covered most of what I had, but maybe a quick follow up on the Midstream side. Greg, you mentioned some frothy devaluation in the Permian, but any update out of that area on that on the organic side with the Rodeo project?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","On the Rodeo project \u2013 this is Tim. I'll just respond. On that one, still working. I think it goes back to my comment that we're seeing the customers and producers just kind of deferring decisions until, I think, they sort through options in the energy markets. So I think it's one we just continue to develop a lot of interest out there on both the NGL as well as the crude side and of course DCP just did something on the gas side. So I think you just have to be thoughtful about where does it fit and can you drive maximum value to make that accretive. But the organic piece if you can put it together is certainly more accretive I think than an inorganic acquisition.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect. Appreciate that, Tim. And then maybe real quick on the heavier crude differential side, apologize if we've covered this already, but seems like a lot of anecdotes on quality issues from Venezuela, and I think you've shifted away from those barrels. But any issues with sourcing overall and maybe your views towards heavier diffs in 2018?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","No, we've agreed on the quality issues out of Venezuela. Clearly, the OPEC cuts have impacted pretty heavily the heavy grade. So you've seen that light, medium light, heavy differential come in. But the Canadian crude has filled a lot of that gap. And so I think there's still \u2013 we've not seen any impact in our system about which crudes and the availability to buy. But where we buy has shifted significantly around as we look through options for supply. So haven't really seen a limitation on that. But we would expect that will continue as long as OPEC cuts continue to keep that narrower than what you've seen in the past couple years on the light heavy spread.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect. Appreciate it. Have a good weekend, guys.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","You too. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.","Jeff Dietert","Good morning and welcome to Phillips 66 fourth quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today\u2019s call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO and Kevin Mitchell, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today\u2019s presentation materials can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information.","Slide 2 includes our Safe Harbor statement. We are going to be banking forward-looking statements today. Actual results are going to be different. Factors that could cause results to differ are included here, as well as in our SEC filings. In order to allow everyone the opportunity to ask a question, we ask you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.","With that, I will turn the call over to Greg Garland, for opening remarks.","Greg Garland","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Total adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $689 million or $1.54 per share. We generated $1.7 billion of operating cash flow. For the year, adjusted earnings were $3.7 billion or $8.05 per share.","During the fourth quarter, we continue to progress our major growth projects. We achieved a major milestone with the initial start-up, the Gray Oak Pipeline. Midstream performed well, delivering another record quarter in the transportation business. Refining and Chemicals ran at 97% utilization. Our turnaround activity and weak product and petrochemical margins impacted our financial results. During 2019, we made significant progress on executing our growth strategy in Midstream and Chemicals. Operating excellence remains a top priority for us, and we maintain our industry-leading performance. We can always do better. We believe that zero incidents, zero accidents workplace is achievable, and it\u2019s a goal we work hard for daily. Midstream completed a number of growth projects and delivered strong operating performance, contributing to another year of record adjusted earnings for that segment.","For the year, Refining ran at 94% utilization, while CPChem operated 97% O&P utilization. In 2019, we delivered a 34% total shareholder return for Phillips 66 shareholders. Phillips 66 Partners is integral to our midstream strategy. PSXP delivered strong operating performance, eliminated incentive distribution rights, achieved a 56% total unitholder return in 2019. Phillips 66 Partners continues to be a leading master limited partnership with a strong financial position, attractive growth opportunities, and disciplined capital allocation. We announced our AdvantEdge66 business transformation program in late 2019. AdvantEdge66 is leveraging technology to transform the way we run our operations, execute projects, and make decisions. Due to this program, we expect to deliver $1.2 billion of enhancements, by the end of 2021.","We are committed to strong shareholder distributions. During the year, we returned $3.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases. In 2019, we increased the quarterly dividend 12.5% and announced a $3 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Since 2012, we\u2019ve returned $26 billion to shareholders, and reduced our initial shares outstanding by 33%. We made significant progress on our key projects. These projects will contribute to future cash generation and create shareholder value. Phillips 66 Partners commenced initial operations on the Gray Oak Pipeline in November, and we anticipate full service in the second quarter of 2020. The 900,000 barrel per day pipeline will transport crude oil from the Permian and the Eagle Ford to the Texas Gulf Coast, including our Sweeny Refinery.","Phillips 66 Partners owns a 42.25% interest in the pipeline. Gray Oak will connect to multiple refineries and export facilities in the Corpus Christi area, including the South Texas Gateway Terminal in which PSXP has 25% ownership. The terminal will have two deepwater marine docks, 8.5 million barrels of storage capacity, and up 800,000 barrels per day of throughput capacity. The terminal is expected to start-up in the third quarter of 2020. The Liberty Pipeline will provide transportation with the growing Rockies and Bakken production areas to Cushing, Oklahoma. We own a 50% interest, and will construct and operate Liberty. The Red Oak Pipeline system will connect Cushing and the Permian Basin to multiple locations along the Gulf Coast, including Corpus Christi, Ingleside, Houston and Beaumont. We own a 50% interest and will operate Red Oak. The Liberty and Red Oak pipelines are backed by long-term commitments, and we are targeting initial service in the first half of 2021.","We are adding three 150,000 barrel per day fractionators at the Sweeny Hub. Fracs 2 and 3 are on track to start up in the fourth quarter of 2020. Frac 4 is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021. The fracs are backed by long-term customer commitments. Upon completion of Frac 4, Sweeny Hub will have 550,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity. We are adding 22.2 million barrels of crude oil storage at our Beaumont Terminal to meet the increased need for Gulf Coast export infrastructure. Upon completion in the first quarter of 2020, the terminal will have 16.8 million barrels of crude and product storage capacity. In addition, we are constructing a new 200,000 barrel per day dock. This project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a total dock capacity of 800,000 barrels per day at our Beaumont Terminal.","In Chemicals, CPChem is expanding its strategic partnership with Qatar Petroleum to develop petrochemical assets in the US Gulf Coast and in Qatar. Pending final investment decisions, these world-scale projects will add ethylene and high-density polyethylene capacity and advantaged feedstock locations. This further enhances CPChem\u2019s leading polyethylene position, despite the world\u2019s growing demand for polymers.","In Refining, we are upgrading one of the FCC\u2019s at the Sweeny Refinery to increase production of higher value petrochemical products and higher octane gasoline. The project is on track to be completed in the second quarter of 2020. The Ponca City Refinery, we\u2019re upgrading FCC to increase yields of higher-value products, and to process more advantaged feedstocks. This project, expect to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. We recently canceled the renewable diesel project at our Ferndale Refinery. Permitting uncertainties were leading to project delays and increased costs, impacting the viability of this project. Our renewable diesel strategy has not changed. We continue to pursue renewable diesel opportunities that leverage our existing infrastructure, supply network and capabilities.","In Marketing, during the fourth quarter, we entered into a retail marketing joint venture with operations, primarily on the US West Coast. The joint venture currently operates 580 retail sites. In addition, the joint venture is expected to close on an acquisition of approximately 100 additional sites in the first half of this year. The joint venture enables increased long-term placement of our refinery production and increases our exposure to retail margins. Our strategy and commitment to capital discipline remains steadfast. We\u2019re focused on operating excellence, project execution, maintaining financial strength, while providing strong returns to our shareholders.","So with that, I will turn the call over to Kevin to review the financials.","Kevin Mitchell","Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our financial results for the year. 2019 adjusted earnings were $3.7 billion or $8.05 per share. We generated $5.6 billion of operating cash flow, excluding working capital. Distributions from equity affiliates, totaled $2.1 billion, including $831 million from CPChem. At the end of the fourth quarter, the net debt to capital ratio was 27%. Our adjusted after-tax return on capital employed for the year was 11%.","Slide 5 shows the change in cash during the year. We started the year with $3 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Cash from operations was $5.6 billion, excluding working capital. There was a working capital use of $830 million, mainly related to an increase in receivables, associated with the timing of crude oil sales at year end. Consolidated debt increased by $500 million, due to issuances at PSXP. During the year, we funded $3.5 billion of adjusted capital spending and returned $3.2 billion to shareholders, including $1.7 billion of share repurchases. Our ending cash balance was $1.6 billion.","Slide 6 summarizes our fourth quarter results. Adjusted earnings were $689 million or $1.54 per share. Operating cash flow was $1.7 billion, including a working capital benefit of approximately $500 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $1.3 billion. We invested $880 million in growth projects, including $260 million of capital associated with the retail marketing joint venture. We returned $810 million to shareholders through $398 million of dividends and $412 million of share repurchases. We ended the year with 441 million shares outstanding.","Moving to Slide 7, this slide highlights change in pre-tax income by segment from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $713 million, driven by lower results in all segments. The fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 24% driven by adjustments to our tax liabilities to reflect a full year adjusted effective tax rate of 21%.","Slide 8 shows our Midstream results. Fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $405 million, a decrease of $35 million from the previous quarter. Transportation delivered another record quarter with adjusted pre-tax income of $250 million, up $2 million from the previous quarter. The increase was due to higher pipeline and terminal volumes that were mostly offset by increased planned maintenance costs. NGL and Other adjusted pre-tax income decreased $49 million, driven by lower propane and butane trading results, following a strong third quarter, as well as inventory impacts. At the Sweeny Hub, the export facility averaged a record 13 cargoes per month and the fractionator ran at 107% utilization. DCP Midstream adjusted pre-tax income of $35 million was up $12 million from the previous quarter. The increase reflects the effect of lower depreciation and amortization, following the third quarter impairments, as well as our increased ownership of LP units, following the elimination of IDRs.","Turning to Chemicals on Slide 9, fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $173 million, down $96 million from the third quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pre-tax income was $154 million. The $97 million decrease from the previous quarter is due to lower polyethylene margins, and seasonally lower volumes, as well as higher turnaround and maintenance costs. Global O&P utilization was 97%. Adjusted pre-tax income for SA&S decreased $1 million. During the fourth quarter, we received $143 million in cash distributions from CPChem.","Next on Slide 10, we will cover Refining. The fourth quarter crude utilization rate was 97%. Clean product yield was 80%. Both are consistent with the prior quarter. This was a heavy turnaround quarter with $232 million of costs, up from $120 million in the third quarter. In addition, our share of WRB turnaround expenses amounted to $41 million this quarter. Refining fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $345 million, down $494 million from last quarter. The chart provides a regional view of the change from the prior period. The Atlantic Basin adjusted pre-tax income decreased $218 million, due to lower gasoline cracks as well as premium coke inventory and margin impacts. In the Gulf Coast, the $108 million decrease was driven by lower product margins, and the Lake Charles Refinery turnaround. This was partially offset by widening Gulf Coast crude differentials. In the Central Corridor, the decrease was due to a decline in the gasoline market crack that was partially offset by widening WCS crude differentials. In the West Coast, the decrease was driven by turnaround activity at the San Francisco Refinery.","Slide 11 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the fourth quarter was $12.45 per barrel, compared to $14.60 per barrel in the third quarter. Our realized margin was $9.50 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 76%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 77%. Market capture was impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We make less gasoline and more distillate than premise in the 3:2:1 market crack. During the quarter the distillate crack increased approximately $1 per barrel, and the gasoline crack declined by almost $4 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $2.35 per barrel increased $1.28 per barrel from the previous quarter, due to premium coke impacts, partially offset by increased butane blending into gasoline. Our feedstock advantage of $1.02 per barrel was improved by $0.99 per barrel from the prior quarter as we benefited from widening WCS and Gulf Coast crude differentials. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials, and inventory impacts. The other category reduced realized margins by $0.54 per barrel.","Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 12, adjusted fourth quarter pre-tax income was $287 million $211 million lower than the third quarter. Marketing and other decreased $203 million from lower margins, driven by less favorable market conditions and seasonality, as well as higher costs associated with a one-time true-up to a branded marketing agreement. The marketing results included a $62 million benefit from 2019 bio-diesel blender tax credits. Specialties decreased $8 million due to lower finished lubricant margins. We re-imaged 532 domestic branded sites during the fourth quarter, bringing the total to approximately 4,200 since the start of the program. In our international marketing business, we re-imaged 82 European sites since the start of the program in early 2019. Refined product exports in the fourth quarter were 157,000 barrels per day, compared with 220,000 barrels per day in the third quarter.","On Slide 13, the Corporate and other segment had adjusted pre-tax costs of $211 million, an increase of $33 million from the prior quarter. The increase is primarily due to higher environmental net interest and employee-related expenses. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results.","Next, I will cover a few outlook items for the first quarter and the full year. In Chemicals, we expect the first quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the first quarter, worldwide crude utilization rate to be about 90%, and pre-tax turnaround expenses to be between $280 and $330 million. We anticipate first quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $200 million and $220 million pre-tax. For 2020, we plan full year turnaround expenses to be between $630 and $680 million pre-tax. We expect corporate and other costs to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million pre-tax for the year. We anticipate full year D&A of about $1.4 billion. And finally, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the low-20% range.","With that, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Phil Gresh, JPMorgan.","Phil Gresh","Yes, good morning.","Greg Garland","Hi, Phil.","Phil Gresh","Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?","Greg Garland","Yes.","Phil Gresh","Okay. So first question, just looking at the quarter here, I mean I think several of your peers, particularly in Refining put up stronger results relative to expectations, and this is obviously a tougher quarter for you guys. So I was hoping it might be possible you could disaggregate that for us or help us understand what you think the differences there were? Obviously, the turnarounds were called out as a factor, but I am also looking at secondary products here, as a pretty big headwind in the Atlantic Basin. So I am wondering if needle coke was the factor there as well. So just if you could help us think through some of the moving pieces? Thanks.","Jeff Dietert","Yes. So I think as you look at the quarter, the turnaround activity was heavily focused in October. And October was actually one of the better margin environments that we had last year. And so our turnarounds were focused in that period. Margin softened substantially kind of in the back half in November and in December. The turnaround expense $232 million was more than our guidance, and up substantially from the $120 million in the third quarter. I think as you look at our premium coke products, there are two primary markets there, the steel industry and EV sales for batteries. Both were weak with weaker GDP and manufacturing activity impacting steel, as well as lower sales volume or disappointing sales volumes in EVs. Both China and India had declining sales in 2019 relative to 2018. As you know, we have extended our coke product line to serve the battery market, which has a substantially faster growth profile and the car manufacturers are investing significantly to increase manufacturing capability. So we expect that growth to return and balance that market.","Phil Gresh","Okay, thanks. The second question would just be on the chemical side of things. Obviously, it seems like everybody has been getting a lot of questions here on the fundamental picture. So, Greg, would love to get your latest thoughts about how you\u2019re viewing this cycle and the pace of potential recovery? And as you look ahead at the investment opportunities that you outlined in your prepared remarks, does the cycle situation right now concern you at all with respect to those possible investments moving forward? Thank you.","Greg Garland","So, hey, Phil, I think first of all, we\u2019re constructive Chemicals in medium and long-term. There is no question in that. Margins today are cyclical trough at least they feel like it any way at this point in time. Yes, I think there is a couple of tailwinds. We saw some economic slowdown globally, as we came in, in the back half of \u201819. Certainly, the tariffs have had some depressing effect on global margins, whether it\u2019s $0.05 or $0.10 or somewhere in between. But certainly it has had an impact. It\u2019s quite a bit of capacity coming on in \u201819 and also in \u201820 and \u201821, so I suspect that there is going to be some headwinds on margins as we move into \u201820 and \u201821 just from the new capacity coming on globally. I think about how CPChem has positioned. I like their hand and how they\u2019re going to play their hand. First of all assets in the Middle East and in the US Gulf Coast are going to be an advantage from a feedstock location. And today an LPG cracker on the Gulf Coast is probably $400 to $500 a ton advantage over a naphtha cracker in Asia or in Europe. So I think that\u2019s good. And then as we look and kind of dissect the product portfolio, CPChem\u2019s exposure is really on the high-density polyethylene side. And so that\u2019s not going to be quite as impacted as some of the other ethylene derivatives as we look out in 2021. Now in terms of the FIDs for the new projects, these are five-year projects to build. We can\u2019t call the cycle that that closely. We probably don\u2019t hit an FID until late 2020 or early \u201821 on the first project. So we\u2019ve got some time certainly to look at it. But I would say, today, that we would be on track to improve those projects and move forward with those projects, just given what we see around the supply and demand balances for high-density polyethylene, where CPChem sits in kind of that ranking of assets.","Kevin Mitchell","Phil, I would say when we look at the IHS full chain margin, it averaged $0.165 in the fourth quarter. December was down slightly below $0.15 per pound and we have seen that rally back year-to-date about $0.165 flat with the fourth quarter average.","Operator","Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Doug Terreson","Good morning, everybody.","Jeff Dietert","Hi, Doug.","Doug Terreson","So, Greg, over the past several years, Phillips 66 has consistently posted better results than peers and especially better than the super majors, and especially in the downstream and it seems like AdvantEdge66 is going to sustain that performance over the medium term. So my question regards this outlook and specifically whether you feel that there are advantages that you have or disadvantages that you don\u2019t have that help explain performance and also how the AdvantEdge66 plan is progressing? And then second, what role does stronger corporate governance play into it in your view, meaning, since you\u2019re one of only a few energy companies at benchmarks performance against diversified peers, which is obviously a higher bar for return on capital than other energy companies and reasons that disciplined capital management would be pretty high emphasis? So, I\u2019ve got two questions, one insight into competitive advantages, progress on AdvantEdge66 and also the role that corporate governance plays into capital management at Phillips 66?","Greg Garland","Okay. Well, thanks for the question, Doug. So working backwards may be, I think strong governance starts with a strong Board of Directors, and we have a strong Board of Directors. They are fully engaged in strategy discussions. We don\u2019t have a Board of Directors meeting at Phillips 66, where we don\u2019t talk about the strategy of the company. We don\u2019t talk about the capital allocation. So those are two topics we cover every Board meeting. I think that as we think about our methodology and our criteria and the 60-40, 60% reinvested back in our company, 40% return back to shareholders, and some flexibility around that given where the opportunities that are in front of us to invest, and where shares are trading. But over a long period of time, that\u2019s where we want to be. I mean that is all contingent upon having opportunities and invest in that exceed our hurdle rates. And if you look at kind of 2017, \u201818, \u201819 so last three-year period, our return on capital employed is 13%. Our nearest Refining peers are kind of high single-digits and by the way, that\u2019s an after-tax return on capital employed. So we\u2019re always interested in returns. And if we can\u2019t find good return projects, we\u2019re simply not going to invest. And then you think about in 2019, returning $3.2 billion back to our shareholders through a strong secured growing dividend and buying our shares, when they trade below intrinsic value that\u2019s just fundamental to our capital allocation strategy. And so you\u2019ll see us continue to do that.","To your first question, around the portfolio, what differentiates us? I think there is a couple of things, one, we do have a strong, diversified portfolio. We\u2019ve got a good portfolio of refining assets. We\u2019ve built a strong Midstream business, $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion of EBITDA in our Midstream business now. Really, if you go back to 2012, excluding DCP, we were kind of about $450 million of EBITDA in our Midstream business. So we\u2019ve built a significantly stronger midstream business at Phillips 66. We\u2019ve got a great Marketing, Specialties business. Then you add on top of that, the Chemicals business. So I like the diversification that we have across the portfolio. It creates investable opportunities for us. It\u2019s a portfolio that generates strong returns. And I would say that Phillips 66 is a great operator. We are consistently one of the safest operators in the industry. We\u2019re generally at or better than the industry average on operating rates, and so we operate really well. And this organization has demonstrated the ability to execute well on these capital projects. We went back to our Board and looked at all of our investments from 2012 to 2019 and we\u2019re right on the money in terms of what we said we are going to put the assets on the ground for. And importantly, we\u2019re right on the money in terms of what we promised to deliver in terms of the earnings from those assets, which is, in my 40 years in the business, that\u2019s probably as good as it gets, Doug.","Doug Terreson","Yes. And then also, Greg, it seems like the AdvantEdge66 plan will help you guys sustain this performance over the medium term. Is there anything to report there on that project?","Greg Garland","I think consistent with what we said at our Investor Day, we still see that there is $1.2 billion of opportunity for us. We hope to drive 60%, 70% of that to the bottom line in terms of seeing that in EBITDA. So you\u2019ll see that in terms of margin capture, you\u2019ll see that in terms of cost reduction, you\u2019ll see that in terms of capital avoidance, but also cost avoidance across the enterprise, but more importantly from that, changing the way of working for our people. At the end of the day, it\u2019s going to be a much better place to work. We\u2019re going to have better tools to make better decisions. We\u2019ll work smarter, we\u2019ll be more agile, we will be more efficient. And I think that will differentiate from our peers. Now everyone is going to move this way, Doug, at some point in time, you either go digital or you die in this business, but I think we are out at least I think in the lead position here.","Operator","Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Neil Mehta","Yes, thanks very much guys. So, first question is on the crude side and wanted to get your perspective on how you think about Western Canadian crude discounts, but also some of the barrels that you import from OPEC or from Alaska that are more medium and heavy in nature. Western Canadian differentials are wide right now. We are trying to get a sense of that sustainability of that from your perspective. And with those medium and sours, we are just trying to think about how the upcoming OPEC meeting could influence the outcomes there?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes, I think that\u2019s a good question. With some of the production in Canada returning from curtailment with the special production allowance, rail waivers, we\u2019ve seen more production coming into the market in Canada. There\u2019s another 150,000 barrels a day or so of new production schedule to start-up in 2020. So there\u2019s more supply coming in, into the market that is supported wider differentials here in the first quarter. As you know, we have about a 30-day lag on delivery there. So the wide discounts in December will really show up in 1Q. We expect WCS discounts to follow the normal seasonal pattern with wider winter differentials, and then they get tighter in the summer as the production companies perform maintenance. I think, as we look with the new IMO environment in the wider high-sulfur fuel oil discounts, we\u2019re expecting to see not only your historical transportation differentials, but probably some increased penalty for sulfur content and so we are expecting that to occur. On the Gulf Coast, we have moved away from a lot of imports from many of the OPEC countries, we\u2019ve reduced exposure there. As you know, we don\u2019t pull anything in from Venezuela. And so I think there is less exposure there from a direct perspective, but indirectly with more OPEC barrels eventually coming into the market, those will be heavy sour barrels, which should widen the heavy sour discount. I think, also, as you look into 2020, there is more Canadian heavy barrels coming in the market. Saudi, Kuwait are bringing up production in the neutral zone, which is heavy sour production. We\u2019ve got some incremental Gulf of Mexico barrels, which are medium and sour. And new production in Norway is 28 API and 0.8% sulfur. So lower quality than a normal North Sea barrel.","Neil Mehta","Thanks, Kevin. Just sticking with the macro, and we\u2019ve got the bull and the bear on IMO on the call in Jeff versus Greg. But I just wanted to get both of your perspectives on how that dynamic is changing, recognizing there is a lot of \u2013 there are a lot of other variables that are affecting particularly the distillate side of the equation, but love a refresh on the views there?","Jeff Dietert","Yes. I\u2019ll start and Greg can clarify what I miss. I think, in isolation, IMO is a positive factor for complex refineries, like ours. Obviously, there are a number of other considerations. High sulfur fuel oil has widened to about a $20 discount relative to Brent. The 10-year average is $12 a barrel. So, IMO has caused some wider discounts there. It was $30 a barrel in December. So it\u2019s come in a little bit. But if you look at the 2020 forward curve, as of last year, it was trading $20 to $25 under Brent. So we\u2019re kind of at the low-end of that range. To the industry\u2019s credit, the transition to the low-sulfur marine fuel market has gone very smoothly, very few compatibility issues or FONAR, fuel non-available reports. I think there will be strong enforcement. Very low-sulfur fuel oil has been rapidly adopted with its high-energy contact viscosity and lubricating qualities. Very low-sulfur fuel oil is actually trading wider than ULSD in some markets. I think the disappointment has been on the diesel side, and diesel has been weak following manufacturing activity that\u2019s been disappointing recently mild winter weather. I think as we look at demand, the first quarter is typically the weakest quarter of the year, and gasoline, diesel demand decline over 1 million barrels a day from 4Q to 1Q. Marine fuel, if you look at some of the major ports, Singapore, in the U.S., Houston, LA, Long Beach, they all have seasonal trends, where the first quarter is the lowest demand quarter for marine transportation. So as that demand picks up, we could see some improvement. And then finally, I think with the weakness in gasoline cracks that\u2019s pulling low-sulfur VGO out of the FCC\u2019s, and into the marine fuel market. As we move into the summer-grade gasoline season, that\u2019s not likely to be the case. So that probably cleaned up the gasoline market faster than otherwise would have been the case in the spring and provide some incremental diesel demand for the marine fuel market in the summer.","Greg Garland","Good job, Jeff.","Operator","Roger Read from Wells Fargo please go ahead. Your line is open.","Roger Read","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just to come back to something that was talked about a little in the fall and probably becomes a bigger issue this spring and ties into that whole description of the gasoline market, but on Tier 3, is there anything that you\u2019ve seen where that\u2019s affecting the market or do you have any particular thoughts as we switch from winter-grade to summer grade and butane comes out whether or not we will see any impacts from Tier 3?","Jeff Dietert","Yes. I think it\u2019s a good point. We are very well positioned for Tier 3. The vast majority of our tier spending has already occurred. And so we\u2019re in good shape there. We produce much higher premium gasoline, as a percent of total, than the industry average. We haven\u2019t seen octane strengthening yet, but I think like you, we\u2019re looking to the shift in RVP and summer-grade, and taking cheap butane is a good blend stock for the winter-grade. We are seeing acolyte prices strengthened in anticipation of the summer. As you know, we recently completed our Lake Charles isom unit, which will provide high-octane material, high-octane blend stocks as well. So I think we\u2019re looking to the summer to see evidence of the importance of Tier 3.","Roger Read","Okay, great. Thanks. And changing gears completely there, midstream side of the business, Greg, I was wondering, it seems like things have gotten tougher in the outlook for a lot of other companies in the Midstream. Is there anything as you look at it where it might make more sense to be acquisitive rather than build or do you need to see valuations and project, I shouldn\u2019t say project, but specific facilities come on the market would have to discount quite a bit from current levels to fit within your return criteria?","Greg Garland","Yes. There\u2019s nothing today that we would be interested in, just simply from a return criteria part, Roger. I think that, but the nice thing that we\u2019re really well-positioned. Certainly, for \u201820 and \u201821. We\u2019ve got a great portfolio of projects that we\u2019re executing. Post \u201821 we\u2019ll see. And if we can find investable opportunities, we\u2019ll invest. We don\u2019t, we won\u2019t. So we are not concerned at this point in time in terms of the opportunities that we have before us. We\u2019ll continue to watch what goes on in that space, but there is really nothing out there today that we would be interested in doing in the Midstream space.","Operator","Paul Cheng from Scotiabank, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Jeff Dietert","Hey, Paul.","Paul Cheng","We have seen a slowdown in the export to Mexico and LatAm. Greg wondering that based on your market intelligence that, has that slow down is driven by the core demand over there is slowing down or that is \u2013 I mean every year that we have to fall in Houston. So yes, we have fall, but it doesn\u2019t seems like year-over-year that that should be incremental factors, so I am trying to understand that, what is the dynamic we are seeing?","Jeff Dietert","Yes, I think, Paul, with regard to Mexico, you remember a few quarters back there were pipelines that were shut down as people were stealing product off the pipelines. And I\u2019m not sure we fully recovered all the demand there. I think that may have suppressed some demand in Mexico. We are seeing that as a continued good market for product exports. I think if you look at our exports in the fourth quarter, they were down a little bit, and that was really driven by some of our export refineries being in maintenance, and in some cases finding higher priced domestic markets than what was available in the export market, but we expect to see \u2013 continue to see some growth in the Latin American market from an export perspective.","Paul Cheng","And Jeff, I think you guys receiving about 300,000 barrel per day of WCS net to you, I think another 100,000 maybe going to the JV partner. With the increase in the WCS production, is there any opportunity for you guys to receive more or that is something that you guys are working on?","Jeff Dietert","Yes. We are constantly assessing the availability of transportation out of Canada and our ability to access more barrels there, attractively priced both from a Mid-continent and the Gulf Coast perspective. And so we\u2019re constantly assessing those opportunities in our commercial people take advantage of the opportunities when they present themselves. But as far as long-term commitments for rail or something like that, we don\u2019t see that at this point.","Operator","Prashant Rao from Citigroup, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Prashant Rao","Thank you for taking the question. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. My first one is on renewables and bio-fuels. I was wondering, Greg, if you could talk a bit more about the decision to cancel the Ferndale project. Apart from the permitting and regulatory hurdles, I mean what you said in the prepared remarks, were there any constraints on feedstock sourcing or developing that network? And then maybe taking a bigger picture view on the other projects in the portfolio of San Francisco, Humber and the off-take in marketing in Nevada, could you help us to understand how these differ from Ferndale, not only in terms of the regulatory and permitting, but maybe also in terms of the feedstock resources?","Greg Garland","So first of all, it wasn\u2019t a feedstock sourcing concern that we had at Ferndale. It was strictly around the ability to permit the project there and so, we withdrew. When you think about what we\u2019re doing in Humber, what we\u2019re doing in San Francisco, these are existing assets that we are either repurposing or utilizing differently. And those are certainly very easy to do, easy to feedstock source, and we\u2019ll continue to look for other opportunities in our portfolio. The deal with Ryze is, essentially we\u2019re responsible for securing the feedstock, and then we have an off-take agreement there. So think of it like a tolling arrangement and we have no concerns there. So as we thought about how we\u2019re going to approach the renewable strategy for us, we want to use existing assets where we could do that. We want to partner with people that had existing technology and capabilities. And then look at grassroots investments, again in a partnership, which is where the Ferndale one really felt that. That would have been circa $800 million to a $1 billion investment in cooperation with REG. So we will see. I think that we certainly have other places that we could build a grassroots facility, and you should expect that our strategy really hasn\u2019t changed. It may not be at the Ferndale location.","Prashant Rao","Okay, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then my second question, so on ESG \u2013 the discussion seems to be progressing pretty quickly overseas and focus on decarbonization is really stronger than it was even a year ago. And it seems discussion here in the states, maybe following a similar path, but perhaps at a delay. So what\u2019s going on overseas? P66 has been a leader in positive ESG momentum within the U.S. hydrocarbon space. So I just want to get your thoughts on looking ahead if there is a greater focus on decarbonization among investors? What are some of the strategies to balance this with and still maintaining P66\u2019s strong return on capital and your low cost of capital across the portfolio and particularly, if you think about growth CapEx decisions, both of what\u2019s currently in the portfolio and maybe overall the longer term opportunities there?","Greg Garland","Yes. Well, I think maybe you want to start with, I think the U.S. is a world leader in technology and innovation, our economies, the envy of the rest of the world. We are a world leader in energy production. We are world leader in emissions reductions, including greenhouse gas emissions. And so I think that there is a path forward that would say we can develop our energy resources responsibly sustainably. We can have a strong growing economy and we can have a better environment. So they are not mutually exclusive at all in our way of thinking. As we think about the opportunity set in front of us, we\u2019re investing in next-generation technologies for lower carbon economy. So things like our OPV, and organic photovoltaics, our solid oxide fuel cells, you\u2019ve seen us introduced two groups, one for heavy-duty trucks, one for light-duty vehicles that increased the mileage by 4%, 5% as a direct reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. So I think that you\u2019ll see Phillips 66 and many companies, frankly approach this problem from many different angles. Specifically around low carbon investments, I think it\u2019s a good thing. I think we should encourage our companies to invest in low carbon technologies, and we should send them to do that. But as we look out two and three decades we still see that fossil fuels are going to be a majority part of the energy mix, just because you are not going to be able to get there from here, with the current technologies that we see.","Operator","Doug Leggate from Bank of America, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate","Hi, good morning everybody. Greg, I wonder if I could take you back to Midstream again, and you did a pretty thorough job of walking us through the assets that you have coming online and your working interest and so on. I am just curious about what is the thinking in terms of the timing, if and when those may be dropped the MLP or do you have different funds for those versus your historical pattern?","Greg Garland","Well, may be we start from the point that I mean all those Midstream assets are qualifying income and they could certainly go through the MLP. We have resisted and will continue to resist specific information about timing of drops, when those drops could occur. I think we\u2019ve spoken publicly about our interest in growing our midstream business at PSXP. It\u2019s an efficient way for us to do that, giving more PSXP trades and the yields that it generates. And then you think about the uplift in some of the parts, we\u2019re still incentive to grow PSXP as fast as we can. And so our view is that you grow it efficiently. But it\u2019s going to pay its own way too. Equity markets are closed, in our view beyond some dribs and drabs around the ATM program, but generally, great balance sheet at PSXP executing $800 million plus capital program this year at PSXP. So at some point in the future, you should expect these assets should logically end up at PSXP. And, but the timing, we just don\u2019t go through that, Doug.","Doug Leggate","Okay. Just a reminder, can you tell me what the EBITDA is associated with those assets held at your C-corp level?","Kevin Mitchell","We have got $800 million to $900 million of EBITDA still at PSX and growing is of course is we are bringing on these new projects too.","Doug Leggate","That does the qualifying income right?","Kevin Mitchell","That\u2019s right.","Doug Leggate","Okay, thanks. My follow-up is just very quickly on turnarounds obviously your turnaround expense is up a bit this year. Just as for Phillips specifically, but also for the industry, I think Jeff touched on this a little bit, but do you anticipate that we are going to see that contributing to clean up of the overhang we\u2019ve seen for gasoline in particular right now? And just specific to Phillips, is there anything unusual this year or is this normal course of business?","Jeff Dietert","Yes, I think that\u2019s a good question, Doug. I think there was a lot of speculation that given the high turnaround activity in 2019 that there was a lot of activity that had been moved forward out of \u201820 into 2019. And a lot of the turnaround activity is on a pretty strict schedule for replacement. And so we are seeing 2020 turnaround activity being relatively high for the industry as well. You look at the Gulf Coast. Pad 3 looks to be a very active turnaround season this spring with a lot of FCC, an alkylation units being included in that planned work. So I think we\u2019re continuing to see turnaround activity in 2020 as well. I think that\u2019s one of the factors that could help clean up the gasoline market.","Operator","Paul Sankey from Mizuho, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey","Hi, everyone. Sorry for the sort of detailed question, but as regards the situation in China, I was wondering in reference to your contracts and how it takes time for these things to feed through, when do you think you\u2019ll be able to say with some degree of certainty what\u2019s actually happening to markets over there? Thanks.","Jeff Dietert","Yes, it\u2019s a good question, Paul. I think it\u2019s still early. I mean, we are seeing, I think some impact on diesel demand diesel cracks jet \u2013 jet cracks. I think we are starting to see some impact on freight rates. It\u2019s really early. It\u2019s a little bit speculative to say that, but I think we are getting some indication of impact already. It\u2019s really hard to measure. And I think it\u2019s going to be difficult to determine the depth and the duration of this event. So I think there is still a huge amount of uncertainty out there. As you well know, there is about 300,000 barrels a day of impact from SARS, and in fact you\u2019ve included it in one of your reports. China\u2019s economy is much bigger today than it was at that time. But I think, Paul, we are still dealing with a lot of uncertainty as to the impact on the coronavirus.","Greg Garland","Paul, I was just going to say, petrochemical, same thing right. I think we\u2019re concerned. We\u2019ll continue to watch petrochemicals. Right now, pricing is kind of moving up a little bit in Asia when you look at petrochemical inventories there at 5-year lows. And so we\u2019ll just \u2013 we\u2019ll just have to see and watch this, but I agree with, Jeff, it\u2019s just almost too early to make a call on this. But it\u2019s certainly as our attention and we\u2019re watching it closely.","Paul Sankey","Yes, understood. I mean obviously this thing really only took off in the past week. I just wondered how long you thought it would be before you could actually say. We now know that this has happened given the time it takes for all this stuff to move around the world.","Greg Garland","Yes.","Jeff Dietert","Yes, it\u2019s certainly impacting commodity markets. The volumes, we\u2019ll have to keep an eye on.","Paul Sankey","Yes. I was thinking more obviously in terms of real volumes. If I could switch, you had a tough October many ways because it was a good environment and you had downtime. Give a sense for what your cost opportunity was or opportunity cost was there? And could you just go over again the outlook for this year in terms of your turnaround? I know you\u2019ve addressed it somewhat, but it\u2019s interesting to think how skewed this quarter might have been if it hadn\u2019t been for the October turnaround? Thanks.","Jeff Dietert","Yes, it\u2019s a good point. We don\u2019t typically comment on LPOs. But I think if you assume most of the downtime occurred in April and adjust and kind of model October versus November versus December, and I think it would get you close. We have provided guidance on turnaround activity. First quarter, we do have some turnaround activity planned as well, and we\u2019ve got the full year guidance there also. So I might just lean to that guidance.","Operator","Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Manav Gupta","Hi, Jeff. Can you clarify where you are with the permitting process of both the Red Oak and Liberty? And Liberty specifically, because there were some news items out there, and I was hoping you could set the record straight over there?","Jeff Dietert","Yes, we are moving forward \u2013 we are getting some feedback there, is that \u2013 I\u2019ll go ahead here. We are moving forward. We have ordered the pipe for Liberty and taken delivery of pipe. The permitting process is moving forward as expected. So we are very much moving forward as anticipated there. It\u2019s a first half 2021 in service date, and all systems are go on both Liberty as well as Red Oak.","Manav Gupta","A quick follow-up on the marketing and specialties side, we saw a slight jump in the CapEx between 3Q and 4Q about $264 million. I am assuming this is associated with the JV payment of the West Coast thing, but the press release is saying, you are going to acquire 100 more stores in 1Q or in the 2020. So I am trying to understand, would there be a second payment associated with these 100 stores or all the payment has already been made here?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes, Manav, it\u2019s Kevin. So yes, you\u2019re right that the variance in CapEx for that segment is all attributable to the formation of that joint venture. So $260 million went in, which is almost the full variance quarter-over-quarter. The additional acquisition that was referred to in the press release does have some additional spend in whenever that timing \u2013 whenever that acquisition closes, there will be some additional spend on that. It\u2019s not of the same magnitude, as the initial upfront JV formation though. So you\u2019ll see that coming through whenever that closes.","Operator","Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Matthew Blair","Hey, good morning, everyone. Given the discounted high-sulfur fuel oil prices in the fourth quarter, were you able to increase your runs of HSFO as you feedstock your refineries. And if so, can you provide any sort of numbers on the incremental volumes or EBITDA uplift? And I guess if not, was the constraint economic or more just like equipment-related?","Jeff Dietert","Yes, it\u2019s a good question, Matthew. I would highlight one of the things we talked about at the Investor Day with some Refining projects that allow us to upgrade over 30,000 barrels a day, a high-sulfur fuel oil to very low-sulfur sub 0.5% blend stock. And we accomplished that late last year, and think there is actually some upside to those volumes. So, we are moving some very low-sulfur product into the market. We are finding opportunities to take advantage of dislocations associated with IMO. I think not only on the high-sulfur fuel oil side, but we have been able to increase the sales of low-sulfur production into the market to capture some of the premiums on low-sulfur material. We have also been able to bring high-sulfur material in as a feedstock for our processing units. As you know, we have substantial coking and treating capacity to upgrade heavy sour streams. I think you might look in our supplemental information. We provide both our crude throughput as well as our total process volumes. And the difference there, would probably give you a good indication on intermediate feedstocks and a lot of those being heavy sour product.","Matthew Blair","Great, thanks for the color. And then on the Chem side, Greg, I was hoping you could share some insights on just the Asia PE markets. We\u2019ve seen margins dip negative or a little bit now haven\u2019t really seen shutdowns. Are those coming in your opinion or I guess through other regions need to cut back first?","Greg Garland","I think our view is that probably Asia and Europe are probably under the most pressure today. And you would expect there could be some cuts there. Also you\u2019re starting to see some price movement in Asia, though. So that\u2019s, I think that\u2019s a sign that people need to do something about the margin environment they find themselves in. And then I would just say, tariffs are still kind of an overhang particularly to China. And so, we will see where all that plays out. But yes, I think it\u2019s pretty tough margin environment out there right now.","Operator","Thank you. We have now reached the time limit available for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeff Dietert","Thank you very much for your interest in Phillips 66. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Brent or me.

My name is Julie and I will be the operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Rosy Zuklic, General Manager, Investor Relations. Rosy, you may begin.","Rosy Zuklic","Thank you, Julie. Good morning, and welcome to the Phillips 66 third quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; Tim Taylor, President; and Kevin Mitchell, Executive Vice President and CFO.","The presentation material, we will be using during the call can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website along with supplemental financial and operating information.","Slide two contains our Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results differ are included here as well as in our filings with the SEC.","With that, I'll turn the call to Greg Garland for some opening remarks. Greg?","Greg Garland","Thanks, Rosy. Good morning, everyone, thank you for joining us today. Third quarter results reflect the benefit of our diversified downstream portfolio and our continued strong operating performance in the challenging market. Our refining was again impacted by difficult market conditions, marketing and specialties and chemicals performed well and we delivered total adjusted earnings of $556 million or $1.05 per share.","During the quarter market cracks further, crude differentials tightened and crude and NGL prices remain depressed. We operated safely, we ran our assets well and our industry leading safety metrics for the year are the best we have ever achieved for holding our costs flat.","We continue to execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We recently lowered capital guidance to approximately $3 billion for 2016. We expect our 2017 capital budget to be below $3 billion. We are growing our higher value businesses and are focused on high return value enhancing projects. We are executing well on our projects under construction and we remain confident that our growth strategy will create value for our shareholders.","We target a long term 60\/40 split between reinvestment and distributions. We expect the free cash flow generated from operations and proceeds from Phillips 66 partners, capital market access to be sufficient to fund our growth program and distribution to our shareholders. We remain committed to our growing, secure and competitive dividends as well as $1 billion to $2 billion per year of share repurchases.","In midstream lower energy prices and narrowed differentials have reduced the need for major infrastructure projects. We\u2019re pivoted to investing in projects to build value around our extensive asset portfolio of refineries and logistics infrastructure. As we think about long term global crude demand we believe that US shale will be called upon to balance the market which will provide additional opportunities to create values in midstream. We are finishing instruction on several of our major projects at Freeport commissioning on 150,000 barrel per day, LPG export terminal is underway with our first cargoes expected to be shipped before year end. Shipments will be mix of term and spot cargoes.","The Dakota Access pipeline is nearing completion. While the project awaits the issuance of an easement from the US army core of engineers to complete work beneath the Missouri river, construction continues on the remaining segment of the pipeline. DAPL and adjoining ETCOP pipeline which is complete and ready for commissioning are expected to provide the most economic option for moving Bakken crude to the Gulf Coast.","Phillips 66 has a 25% interest in each of these joint ventures. In the Gulf Coast the Beaumont Terminal expansion is ongoing. We have 3.2 million barrels, a new storage capacity under construction, 2 million of which are expected to be in service by year end. The Beaumont terminal continues to be a viable asset and we have plans to ultimately expand this facility to 16 million barrels.","Phillips 66 partners remain an important part of our midstream growth strategy. So far this year the partnership has raised more than $2 billion in the capital market through debt and equity issuances which is used to grow through asset acquisition and the evolvement of organic projects. Partners remains on track to achieve its growth objective. Over five year 30% distribution compound annual growth rate through 2018.","DCP midstream has made good progress on its strategic initiatives. DCP has reduced its cost structure, decrease its capital spending and continues to convert commodity expose contracts to a fee basis. We are pleased to see the improvements in our financial results and we expect that DCP will be self funded going further.","In chemicals, global demand remains healthy. CPChem is advancing in US Gulf Coast petrochemical project which is about 85% complete. We expect the polyethylene business to start by mid 2017 and the ethane cracker in the second half of 2017. Once these new facilities are in operation, CPChem global ethane and polyethylene capacity will increase by approximately one-third. As capital spending will be reduced following the completion of projects, we expect to see increased distributions with CPChem starting next year.","In refining this quarter we completed the saleable Whitegate refinery in Ireland and advanced several returning hands in projects. At the Wood River refinery, the bottleneck in yield improvement projects were complete this quarter and increase is available heavy oil processing capability. At the Billings refinery we are increasing the amount of heavy Canadian crude we can run to 100%. And at Bayway work on the FCC modernization progressing on schedule.","During the quarter we generated nearly 1.2 billion in cash from operations and from the Phillips 66 Partners equity offering. We have returned more than $500 million of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the third quarter. Since the formation we have returned $12.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and the repurchase or exchange of 120 million shares.","So with that I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to review the quarter results.","Kevin Mitchell","Thanks, Greg. Good morning. Starting on slide four; third quarter net income was $511 million, we had several special items that netted to a loss of $45 million. In chemicals we had $89 million impairment of CPChem equity affiliate. We also received a legal award in the third quarter but increased refining net income by $43 million. After removing these items adjusted earnings were $556 million or $1.05 per share.","Cash from operations for the quarter was $883 million and was reduced by a pension plan contribution of over $300 million. Excluding $339 million of working capital benefit operating cash flow was $544 million. In addition PSXT raised nearly $300 million from an equity offering during the third quarter. Capital spending for the quarter was $661 million with $365 million spent on growth mostly in midstream. Distribution to shareholders in the third quarter totaled $508 million including $329 million in dividends and $179 million in share repurchases. At the end of the third quarter our debt-to-capital ratio was 27% and after taking into account our ending cash balance our net-debt-to-capital ratio was 21%. Year-to-date annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 7%, our adjusted effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 30%.","Slide five compares third quarter and second quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were up by $57 million driven by improvements in midstream and marketing and specialties. Next we will cover each of the segments individually.","I'll start with Midstream on slide six. After removing the non-controlling interest of $28 million, Midstream's third quarter adjusted earnings were $75 million, $36 million high up in the second quarter. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter were $63 million down $2 million from the prior quarter driven by higher operating cost associated with seasonal maintenance and low volumes due to refinery downtime. This was partially offset by higher equity earnings from Rockies Express Pipeline which included the receipt of $10 million settlement net to us.","In NGL, adjusted earnings were $3 million for the quarter, this represented a $20 million increase from the prior quarter and was largely driven by higher earnings on seasonal trading and storage activity. Our share of adjusted earnings from DCP midstream was $9 million in the third quarter, an $18 million improvement compared to the previous quarter. This was primarily due to favorable contract restructuring efforts, lower costs, improved asset performance and higher natural gas prices.","Turning to chemicals on slide seven. Third quarter adjusted earnings for the segment were $190 million the same as in second quarter. In olefins and polyolefins adjusted earnings decreased by $5 million from the prior quarter reflecting unplanned downtime. This was mostly offset by higher polyethylene chain margins. Global O&P utilization was 91%. Adjusted earnings for SA&S increased by $6 million on higher benzene margins.","In Refining, we operated well with 97% crude utilization for the quarter. Clean product yield was constant at 84% with gasoline yield at 44% for the quarter. Pre-tax turnaround costs were $117 million in-line with guidance. Realized margin was $7.23 per barrel roughly the same as in the second quarter.","The chart on slide eight provides a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. In total, the Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $134 million, down $18 million from last quarter.","Regionally, the Atlantic Basin of West Coast had lower earnings than last quarter primarily due to lower market cracks. The Central Corridor had adjusted earnings that were $87 million higher than the second quarter resulting from an improved [indiscernible] cracks and benefits from higher margins on Canadian crude. And in the Gulf Coast earnings were slightly lower than the second quarter due to increased cost related to plant maintenance activity.","Next, we'll cover market capture on slide nine. Our worldwide realized margin for the third quarter was $7.23 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $12.96 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 56% compared to 62% in the second quarter. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries and our production relative to the market crack calculation. With 84% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack.","Losses from secondary products of $2.94 per barrel were $0.47 per barrel lower this quarter as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such as coke and NGLs increased. Feedstock advantage was approximately $1 per barrel lower than the second quarter, as crude differentials tightened further specially the LLS mild spread.","The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. These costs were lower than the second quarter due to improved product differential and crude purchasing timing partially offset by higher RINs prices.","Let's move to Marketing and Specialties, where we posted a strong third quarter. Adjusted earnings for M&S in the third quarter were $267 million, up $38 million from the second quarter. In Marketing and Other, the $29 million increase was largely due to increased margins in both the US and Europe. The iron wholesale business was sold in September as part of the Whitegate refinery disposition. Specialties' adjusted earnings increased by $9 million, primarily as a result of improved base oil margins, and higher volumes at the XL joint venture.","On slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted after-tax net costs of $110 million this quarter, an improvement of $1 million from the second quarter.","Slide 12 shows year to-date cash flow. We began the year with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations for the first three quarters $1.8 billion. Working capital changes increased cash flow by $500 million. Phillips 66 Partners has raised $1 billion in a public equity offering through the third quarter. We have funded $2 billion of capital expenditures on investments and year-to-date we\u2019ve distributed nearly $1.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We ended the third quarter with $521 million shares expanding.","At the end of September our cash balance stood at $2.3 billion up slightly from $2.2 billion at the end of the second quarter. Earlier this month PSXP raised $1.1 billion in the debt capital markets that will positively impact the fourth quarter cash balance.","This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next I\u2019ll cover a few outlook items. In the fourth quarter in chemicals we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid 80s due to planned turnaround activity. In refining we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low 90s and before tax turnaround expenses to be $170 million to $200 million. We expect corporate and other costs to come in between $130 million and $140 million after tax due in part to increased interest expense from the recently issued PSXP notes and companywide we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid 30s.","With that we will now open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse, your line is open.","Edward Westlake","Good morning, everyone. Just on the cash generation I mean obviously, cash generation this year has been a lot lower than last year part of that is the margin environment part of that investing in CPChem, but may be just talk a little bit about whether you\u2019re concerned about the cash flow drop and obviously you got some lead as to improve it what those big ones are?","Greg Garland","Well, we always tell this wasn\u2019t \u2013 always be a very volatile business and I think we plan for that as we think through mid cycles we should generate $4 billion to $5 billion of cash and $1 billion to $2 billion coming out of the MLP and we think that\u2019s sufficient to fund $1.3 billion dividend going and to fund $3 billion ish capital program and $1 billion to $2 billion ish every purchase. I think we feel pretty comfortable within that context.","Kevin Mitchell","If I could just add onto that so as we move into 2017 I think there is a couple of things one is, capital certainly has come down this year. We are guiding to something under $3 billion in 2017. At CPChem as we finished up the cracker in these big projects we get the benefit of that. You get the incremental earnings coming off from these projects. So we think crude cash flow actually starts to build into 2017.","Edward Westlake","Okay and then back in September 2015 as you talk about this not pivot but sort of emphasis on improvement refining tool you did give some self help actual numbers by region obviously margin outlook may have changed since then. Do you feel comfortable those ranges are still reasonable for sort of planning purposes?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes I think they are still fairly reasonable. I think that returns are going to be just a little lower but as we went back and we back half season with these projects we would still make these investments in refining.","Edward Westlake","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffery Dietert from Simmons, your line is open.","Jeffery Dietert","Good morning. I would like to ask question on the Freeport LNG terminal obviously LNG or LPG exports have been rising in the US broadly and you are coming on with inventories relatively high and opportunity to export. Could you talk about what you are seeing demand wise what arbitrage looks like in exporting LPGs and kind of how that's evolved this year?","Timothy Taylor","Yes Jeff, this is Tim. Yes, I would say that from a demand standpoint still strong when you look at the numbers on the export side because the length in the US for particularly propane coming out of the US to international markets, so propane hydro plants for instance require a propane pick stock in the Asia, the heating markets and but the challenges has been as energy prices have deeps and narrows really across around the world the arbs on those have come in substantially. From the short term I think we still see good demand. We feel good about that but we look at it and say commercial side, the arb between the US net-back price and the destination price in Europe and Asia is lower than what we would expect long term. So I think when we startup we would expect to see that. That said we are still good underlying demand for the cargoes and the terminal.","Jeffery Dietert","And seeing new construction of new facilities that are going to increase LPG demand in Asia in the years ahead as well?","Timothy Taylor","Yes, I mean there is infrastructure, there is European interest, Latin American as well and the other thing that is out there of course, the flexibility of crackers to run more LPG in place of NAFTA on top of new petrochemical projects for instance that the propane dehydro that are very specific to propane and then there is continuing growth in the thermal market, the heating market for that as well.","Jeffery Dietert","Thanks Tim. ","Operator","Doug Leggate from Bank of America is online with the question. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate","Thanks everybody. Greg I want to take two quick ones. First of all it looks like your NGL business, DCP quarter looks like it started to improve a little bit I don't know if that's macro on the higher oil price if now feels as if you have got that thing stabilized and turning to the right direction. I just wanted to know if you can characterize, this is not bottomed out?","Greg Garland","No. I am happy to do that. I think couple of things, first of all I think that the work that DCP has done to reduce our cost structure, cash breakeven nearly dropped from kind of $0.60 per gallon NGL somewhere below $0.35 gallon NGL. So you see in that benefit show up. NGL prices quarter-on-quarter actually just a little bit lower but natural gas prices were up about $0.80 or so $0.89 I think. And so that was the benefit to DCP. So you had a combination effect of ore cost plus good through put volumes and then kind of neutral on NGL prices will better on gas prices.","Timothy Taylor","The other thing I would add maybe to that is that there has also been progress, continued progress converting some of the commodity based contracts to fee base and that's helped that a bit as well. So this is really about the three points that Greg talked about that helped drive that improvement.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate, speaking with you. Just more topic -- given one of your competitors the other day is how you feel about your embedded GP value drag. I know you have talked about this periodically but yield on your MLP obviously is much more constructive perhaps. I am just curious do you have any similar feelings around the market under recognizing the value of your midstream business in particularly any steps you might think about taking to improve the GP monetization or whatever. Just general thoughts around what you thought of \u2013 you\u2019re thinking about going forward?","Timothy Taylor","Doug, I would say I think our view continues to be by delivering steady fee base growth. We can maximize the value of the LP and frankly we think the GP is going to be recognized in that specifically the question to the GP we don't have any immediate plans to do anything with the GP. We are looking at it all the time and we certainly considering option to create value, I think that we know and kind of understand the lifecycle of MLPs and I think that tool on your toolkit being able to adjust the GP to get the optimal capital structure to continue to grow the MLP is very important and it shouldn't be overlooked in that decision process.","Doug Leggate","You don't feel you are anywhere close to that yet?","Timothy Taylor","I don't even have any immediate plans to IPO or GP if that's the question. It's 100 million, it's relatively small at this point in time.","Doug Leggate","Yes. I guess, you\u2019re getting at, you probably got a lot of growth ahead of you on the GP, it becomes burden on the MLP so when I said you are not close to that yet is that fair characterization of it, there is no need to be MLP?","Greg Garland","Yes. That's correct. Now we think about that a lot in the cost of capital at the MLP. I mean the IDR do at some point become a the cost of capital burden for the MLP.","Doug Leggate","All right. Appreciate the answer Greg. Thank you.","Operator","Paul Sankey from Wolfe is online with a question. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey","Hi guys. If I could directly follow-up on that we have seen a strategy shift from [Indiscernible] petroleum I am sure you are aware of in terms of accelerating dropdown. Can you talk about the parameters you have to potentially accelerate what you do in terms of dropdowns and remind us what your long term current plans are in terms of guidance for that trade we call it? Thank you.","Greg Garland","Yes. First of all, we are not talking on 2018 today in terms of guidance Paul. So I think we are committed to the 1.1 billion to 2018 that will represent 30% cagier in terms of that. I don't know Tim if you have got any other comments around it you want to make.","Timothy Taylor","No. I think that we see value in continuing that. We continue to invest in the midstream so I think there is a growth dimension to that so our view is that we continue to develop the pipeline of projects, grow that business, get the good value from the MLP and whole midstream business, Paul. So it's really that commitment to getting that size and then just looking beyond that is to continue to grow.","Paul Sankey","Yes, I guess, we have said, if you got 30% cagier it's probably pretty healthy basically to say the least. If I can totally change subject, Greg we have seen in the upstream side across the board costs have fallen dramatically in every aspects of the industry. Your chemical project was nothing it says 85% complete actually come in somewhat over budget, somewhat delayed, we talked about this years ago in terms of controlling the cost. Could you just remind us or update us on how it is that in this cost environment we still have seen upside to cost in the downstream? Thanks.","Greg Garland","Yes. Well, there is quite a bit of downstream activities still going on Paul. This kind of point that out. There is a lot of construction, lot of crackers under construction. So I think our polyethylene solely will come on kind of within expectations in terms of both the timing and the cost of facility, we have signaled that we think the crackers going to be in the second half of the year. So the cost of cracker probably will be 5% to 10% more than what we would have expected just due to delays we have seen in construction. I would tell you that Tim is working that really hard. And I don't know if you want to make a couple of comments what we are seeing on the ground today and some of the things we are doing to try to mitigate that.","Timothy Taylor","Yes Paul and I think about this really not been equipment and engineering particularly. It's really been on the construction side and productivity. So the labor input to get the work done has gone up as we have seen less skilled crafts. Each contractor has a different set of workforce. We have been, I think the contrast is that polyethylene use pretty much complete on time on budget as we talked about in the second quarter of next year. The cracker we struggled a bit more and really the challenge now that we risen to really as owners is to reorganize working with the contractor the work front for additional resources from the owners as well as CPChem on that to really improve that productivity and so we are starting to see better progress here as a result of that but that's really what\u2019s left is to finish the construction.","Paul Sankey","Understood. Thank you guys.","Operator","Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs is online with a question. Your line is open.","Neil Mehta","Good morning guys. I wanted to get your perspective on the refine product macro as we are going into 2017 specifically any differentiation and thinking between gasoline and diesel and then also crude spreads as you see the market right now?","Timothy Taylor","Yes, Neil this is Tim. I think fundamentally we just look at the market and I have seen recently we have seen both crude product inventories in the US start to come down that's encouraging but it's got a long way to go. It would be our view. So we think that fundamentally it's kind of weaker outlook when you think about the products and the crude spread and the crack margins on the business. And Neil the comment I would make is, if you look at the forward curves, it's different than last year. You are seeing less carry and so I think that we readjusted going in the fourth quarter probably not as much in -- as it was last year to continue to produce a higher rates in the northern hemisphere as a seasonally weak time. So I think growing constructively continue to get those inventories down required both on the crude and product side to structurally change that and then I think seasonally you should expect that as the US demand really you look out this looks pretty good right now in terms of the carry still not a strong crack. Gasoline weaker than it has been and I think that reflects what we see as the seasonally normal driving season and the real outlet piece of it this is you get turn around right now. Those come out and then you got to turn to export markets to absorb the excess or there will be some talk of utilization decreased the balance of the markets. But that's really what's required as more balancing.","Neil Mehta","Three year marketing arm, are you able to see what gasoline demand trends are looking like in the U23S and any change in terms of the pace of demand, Greg?","Greg Garland","Yes. We look at our branded piece and we're still seeing at same side. We would say we're seeing that 2% to 3% year-on-year increase. So, and you look at the Kendall driven all the indicator some changes there but generally still a pretty good demand picture on the gasoline side. So, that\u2019s another piece that help balance that long run. As you got to continue to have good demand growth to balance that.","Maybe as in a side, we're actually seeing similar patterns in Europe. They were German retail operations in or Central Europe operation. So, it does, it has been a response on the price side to demand really across the world.","Neil Mehta","And then my follow-up is on capital spending. You guys indicated in the release that you're going to target below $3 billion in 2017. Can you provide an early look at what you see is changing 2016 to 2017 from a capital spending perspective, recognizing that come December we're going to get even more clarity?","Greg Garland","Yes. So, I think we'll finish this year right around $3 billion in 2016. And we're going to be, we go to our board in December for approval of the capital budget. It's going to be somewhere between 25 and 29 at this point in time, Neil. We differed investment in for act 2 and so that's a piece of what we're seeing. And then we're just finishing up the big projects and so there's given the uncertainty in the markets and everything is going on, we're pivoting to a smaller projects. So, that's actually positive in my view because we need to make adjustments capital next year, we can. So, we're not, we don\u2019t have these long run committed projects we have to follow through and invest down.","So, I think we feel good about the 2017 capital program. We got some good projects in there that we want to execute. And obviously, our full attention right now is on commissioning and starting up this LPG export facility. But you will have cargoes next month, actually.","Neil Mehta","Thanks guys.","Operator","Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil is online with a question. Your line is open.","Blake Fernandez","Hi, folks, good morning. I believe this is the last call before year-end. So, I'm not sure if Clayton's on the line or not but I just like to thank him and wish him this time really well. Greg, my question to on Dapple, I see the commentary about potentially it's still expected first quarter start. Obviously looking at the new headlines that could prove ambitious. Could you have maybe just some commentary around that and assuming there is a differal, is it clear to think that there really the only impact is simply differing the EBITDA. I mean, obviously your cost would slow and no other impact on other operations?","Greg Garland","No. I think that's accurate. It may slip a little bit. I think we're still optimistic I would say. They will get this resolved. There is the work is continuing except for about, I don\u2019t know, a couple of miles actually. So, there is not that much left to be finished once we get the Eastmen to go underneath the Missouri River. So, I think that can be wrapped up in a relative short order. Obviously we need to go ahead to get started on that. And we just, we would expect that we'll get that.","Blake Fernandez","Okay. Secondly, buybacks were still healthy but rolled over a bit quarter-to-quarter. And obviously we did have the drop in this quarter. So, I'm just curious for one, should we think about this new liquidity coming in to help kind of support buybacks going into next year. And do you have a net cash amount that you're expecting to receive, I think it was a 1.3 billion total drop?","Greg Garland","Well, I think that's buyback. We've always got it too, $1 billion to $2 billion I think. Certainly for this year we'll be towards a lower end of that range and we'll see what happens. But remember we get CapEx from 39 to three this year. We were kind of targeting a one and one five'ish, one sixes this year. And so, if we come in close to lower end of the range, well, we do share repurchases not as much but still a significant amount.","But, I actually think that $1 billion to $2 billion is good guidance for 2017, is we look at our balances and what we think we are going to do.","Kevin Mitchell","Blake, this is Kevin. On the drop, so is a 1.3 billion drop, 200 million of that was take back units. So, no cash effect. The other 1.1 was funded with cash, so debt offering by PSXP, that's 10 years to pay for the bulk of the drop transaction.","Blake Fernandez","But Kevin, there is no tax leak to do anything. We need to be aware of there?","Kevin Mitchell","No.","Blake Fernandez","Okay. Okay, thanks guys.","Kevin Mitchell","Okay.","Operator","Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank is online with a question. Your line is open.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks. Maybe if I could, one question on the midstream. I mean, earlier this year you take down the midstream EBITDA guidance for 2018, 10% to 20% driven primarily by current market environment. Can you run through what were the biggest drivers of the reduction, what the assumed commodity environment was and on the flipside relative to that assumption, the potential for any of that to come back as oil price and other commodities potentially recover?","Timothy Taylor","Yes. Ryan, this is Tim Taylor. The primary driver on the, we should get 10% to 20% off than what we had thought originally in the 2018 run rate. Most of that was the commodity and the primary variance would be the orb on the LPG exports that we were expecting at the time when, back when crude was $2 to $100. And so, that's come off by truly narrow that are being. So, that's a piece of that. So, your view on energy going forward, it's really important when you think about what's the LPG price in the US and what's the alternative values around the world.","So, I think that if you're viewing energy, it strengthens in that should widen those our job. But that's essentially the biggest driver and then that was where most of the commodity exposure came. PREP 2. And then the other part of the reduction is we did differ PREP 2, the content safe pipe from the Eagle Ford and those were essentially fee based earnings but that was not commodity exposed the bulk of that reduction related to that commodity.","Ryan Todd","Okay. Thank you. And then maybe a follow-up on the last question on the drop, the recent drop with PSXP. How many was it was a very large drop and there was as you highlighted the track restructure from your point-of-view in terms of the cash proceeds. Any talks as you look forward in terms of just general commentary on ongoing health of the recovery of that market in terms of the ability of PSXP to funds foreseeable, the foreseeable future drop program?","Timothy Taylor","I think we demonstrated we can access the capital markets in 2016. That\u2019s kind of the pace we need to be at to achieve the 1:1 level by 2018, at least run rate EBITDA by 2018. So, I think we're confident that we can execute the plan. The markets will be there for us and so just be on that. We like the profile we have with the master limited partnership. We like the backlog of projects that we're constructing. We like the existing EBITDA is still left that's droppable. So, I just, I look at all that and say 1:1 is really doable.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks.","Timothy Taylor","Yes.","Operator","Paul Cheng with Barclays is online with a question. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng","Good afternoon.","Greg Garland","Good afternoon, Paul.","Paul Cheng","Tim. Several question. At the first, Tim. The European Asian refunding margin, we have seen some pretty strong count the season of uptick in margin over the last three months. Q is that what you guys see on the ground in your European operation. Is it demand driven or it is because of some supply outage or anything?","Timothy Taylor","Paul, as I alluded to earlier, we're seeing pretty good demand when we look at Europe. The demand growth there and the crude divs has certainly improved their competitive positions. So, when we look at for instance a Humber, we see, that\u2019s it\u2019s much more competitive that it was say when a wide dis for in the US. So, I think it reflects opportunities to continue to export Europe, more competitive cost bases. And then we're seeing relatively good demand there. And in Asia we're seeing recent strengthening whether be in chemicals or even in the fuels business, so it feels like Asia seems to be on the upswing in the kinds of markets that on the transportation side for instance in consumer market, we're seeing that same kind of thing is helpful approve.","And we had a fairly high turnaround season I think in China. And that's coming back. So, I think that that supply may impact that. But generally Asia feels better than it did probably, three four months ago.","Paul Cheng","Yes. Because if you light that Mark can maybe underestimating the demand on the global basis. Secondly, that on just curious, with the IMO 2020 bunker fuel switch, is there any in similar form that we changed the way how you run your refinery in Europe, Bayway and the Gulf Coast system?","Timothy Taylor","No. I -- we've looked. It really doesn't feel like that. I mean, I think you always going to think about the incremental values. But really as a system and the way we look to competitiveness, we still see that European North, and Eastern US is one of the most challenge market areas. But I think it fundamentally has not changed the way that we look at the business on that.","Paul Cheng","So, you will not need to say just because the high sulphur we see the demand will be dramatically lower and you're going to pick up the lower sulphide gas oil demand. So, you don\u2019t believe that that will lead you to may have to adjust the way how you run it?","Timothy Taylor","Well, I think sulphur continues to tighten overtime. We're seeing sufficient markets that take some of the higher sulphur products but that's diminished and people continue to invest that Paul. But I think that's more gradual conversion. There still seems to be a plenty large enough market sync out there to absorb that. Even as I made the adjustments in the marine part of the business etcetera to manage that through blending or through other markets that can absorb that.","Paul Cheng","Okay. And based on you\u2019re the curve in fourth quarter estimate on the turn the rung. So, your full turn the rung expense will be probably as mainly be low four -- 500. A bit lower than at the beginning of the year when you initially forecast. Is that driven by delay or from activity postpone or activity or just the work has been done more effectively. In other words, I just trying to understand whether that's buyer activity that we should expect from you guys in the 2017?","Greg Garland","So, it's mostly push of expenditure into future periods both on turnaround, catalyst change expense, Paul. I will give an update on where we expect 2017 to becoming in the next call.","Paul Cheng","So, some of them done, we should expect is going to show up in 2017, Kevin?","Kevin Mitchell","That's right, yes.","Paul Cheng","Okay. And then a final one, Kevin, since I got you here. As a company, what is your overall strategy that over the next several years as you continue to top-down and the organic investment in the LP level? So, LP that is going up? So, we assume as the LP that going up, your which one to accommodate by lower your seek up that so that your over or consolidate that will be more and that's fret or even going down. Or that you're saying that okay, I mean see [COP is see] COP, LP is LP, so you don\u2019t get them together.","Kevin Mitchell","No. We do look at them together, Paul. And I think you're right on there in terms of your initial leading comment that overtime certainly the LP that is going to increase, and of course we just done the 1.1 billion,. And while it won't have an immediately, immediate offset at the see COP. Over time, you can expect that the see COP should start to de-lever if you look at the see COP on a standalone basis.","Paul Cheng","And on that basis, that I mean given Greg, earlier, talking about volatility in the mark and certainties. Should the company or the industry actuate even take a more conservative approve and started into [indiscernible]?","Greg Garland","Well, this we've always guided that we're going to stay between 20% and 30% at the cap. And so, we may drift over that just a little bit at one point in time. We're going to try to stay very disciplined within that van, Paul. And it's probably not a bad time to build some cash too as you think about that going forward.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Very good, thank you.","Operator","Roger Read from Wells Fargo is online with a question. Your line is open.","Roger Read","Great. Thank you, good morning.","Greg Garland","Hi, Roger.","Roger Read","Hey. I guess two things here. One is a follow-up on Blake's question about Dapple. Are there any seasonal concerns if we don\u2019t get started sooner rather than later that you can't do the construction work up there?","Greg Garland","No. I think they will be able to do the drill and do what we need to do. Yes, essentially you're preparing, you doing a ditch work now and the weather I fine. So, either drills is not really that impacted from a weather standpoint.","Roger Read","Okay. Perfect, thanks. And then a little more on this sort of the midstream with the changing in the overall CapEx structure and total plans and which is say some change in the ownership structure one of your JV partners. How do you think about M&A in the midstream sector I mean generally speaking when things start to tighten up and slowdown cash gets a little harder to get than M&A should pick up and I guess we have seen that somewhat in the MLP sector that controls most of those assets. How do you look at M&A opportunities and what is your appetite for that sort of thing right now?","Timothy Taylor","I think, we kind of look like everyone. We look at everything that's out there. I think our assessment is, the values are still relatively high aspiration levels are high. We did three smaller transactions at PSXP level in the quarter or I guess one will close in this quarter but so I think that we will look at everything that's out there. There is nothing big that I see at this point on the horizon for us. We still have a great organic portfolio of opportunities to invest in and this still makes sense for us to invest at 6 or 7 build multiple and trade that up versus paying 15 or 20 times or something out there.","Roger Read","Yes. I guess my question that was along the lines, if you are personally a little less interested in scaling into larger projects are you seeing any change in the value of those larger projects that are already in existence or they just remain at the very high multiples?","Timothy Taylor","No. I don't think our view is, we haven't seen the valuation come down and I think, I am kind of the view right now is that I think Permian is going to be more challenging in the future than it has been in the past and that existing assets strictly poised is probably going to be more valuable in the future than it is today.","Roger Read","So wouldn't that argue to make a acquisition today?","Timothy Taylor","Yes probably so, you could try the right acquisition but same thing I think we still have the ability to grow our portfolio, to hit our targets that we have laid out there for folks and feel comfortable we have got that opportunity portfolio in front of us well on hand.","Roger Read","Okay. I appreciate it Tom, thank you.","Operator","[Indiscernible] from UBS Securities is online with a question. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just one follow-up on previous comment, I think you mentioned potentially utilization rates coming down or what sounds like maybe run cuts might be necessary and I think [Bolero] mentioned them earlier in the week that you could see some run cuts down the mid time just from the seasonal basis that might actually need to happen. I am curious if you sort of view the same way and maybe see other regions that maybe more risk or run cuts than others running into the end of the year?","Greg Garland","I will take this up and Taylor can correct me maybe, but as I think about it inventories are through the chain and certainly they are coming down in the US which is constructive, but I would say that in turnarounds we cannot turn statistically we tend to run better and so you have got that as an option. But I do think industry is looking at some run cuts in the fourth quarter and given the carry that's out there we are not going to be incented to run like we did in the fourth quarter of last year. So I don't think we are going to repeat that problem again. So I think you will see. I think like crude refineries are going to be challenge I think mid comps is going to be challenge. The crack stand that \u2013 they are not that great. So I think bulk of it to look at that.","Timothy Taylor","Yes. I think it is the real push, the heavy shower, medium shower that's really if you have got that capacity that's the most competitive and then the mid comp it's very seasonal in the summer goes short, winter goes long. So I think that's a place we see a light suite and that the balance comes into play there and you are seeing the market kind of respond to data. It's a well supplied market so I think it's the usual things around the Atlantic basement and just that light suite complex that's out there with the crude side with narrow differentials.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Appreciate that. Second question is modeling bit of two parts here. So when I think of the month down time at CPChem and third quarter just wondering if that lead into fourth quarter or was it ring fence and then just along the modeling line of thing as far as EBITDA contribution from the LPG terminal it sounds like maybe it will hit the fourth quarter a bit, how should we expect the ramp up to get to that full run rate. Should we \u2013 is that all going to be in one queue or will it be maybe throughout the first half of 2017?","Greg Garland","So on chemicals in terms of utilization, we have two major crackers in turnaround right now. One in Saudi Arabia, the [indiscernible] company and the second is the seizure cracker and so those continue through roughly half the quarter. So that's the guidance down as primarily the plan turnaround there. And so that was the \u2013 that's big change to the guidance in the mid 90s or mid 80s. On the LPG we will be getting loading you got to get through the qualification, the clean out, the start-up and so I think our view is it ramps through the first couple of quarters through next year but hopefully can accelerate that but I think the volume piece of that comes depends on how quickly the operation stabilize and we can get that on and running.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. I appreciate the color. Have a nice weekend everyone. ","Greg Garland","You too, thank you.","Operator","Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets is online with a question. Your line is open.","Brad Heffern","Hi everyone. Greg, I was wondering if we can go back to a comment that you made earlier in the call which is I think you said you would expect the businesses to generate $5 billion in cash flows sort of on a cycle average basis. I also noted that the commentary around the current refining market hasn't seen particularly bullish to me. So I am wondering how you reconcile this two things and what makes you think that the cash flow picture next year is going to look significant better than this year, if that is what do you think? ","Greg Garland","I think it will be better next year. I am not sure we are going to get all way back to mid cycle I think it's going to be into the second half of 2017 before you see the kind of inventory corrected even though it's going the right direction today I think it's going to take a while to work through that. And so I think it will be the back half of the year before we see margin improvement in the refining business. ","Timothy Taylor","And there is always a seasonal impact. The fourth and the first quarter typically weaker with the stronger driving season. So if the inventories stay in balance it kind of sets up for that that. So there is the inherent seasonality cycle that comes on the rebounding side but I think generally our view would be that probably a bit low mid cycle but hopefully better with the stronger summer season as next year. ","Brad Heffern","Okay. Sure. And I guess maybe ask this slightly different way, have your thoughts on one mid cycle has changed at all given what we have seen in 2016? ","Greg Garland","No. Yes and no. I think two years ago we would have told you we thought that mid cycle was probably a $1 barrel better because of the crude dips. I think that's probably gone away. And so I am kind of back to more of normal mid cycle and my own thinking in terms of that. It's just kind of rule of thumb I kind of use between $2 and $2.5 of barrel net income is a good mid cycle number for us.","Brad Heffern","Okay. Thanks for that and then question on DCP. Obviously you are having a partner change there and so I was curious if you see that changing the way partnership runs in any significant way. And also if you like that as being 50:50 JV or somehow the other half of the partnership sell out as part of that process of you be interested in owning all of it?","Greg Garland","This is third or the fourth partner change. I keep lose track of change so many times in 16 years. But look I think in this great company we know them. They are going to be a terrific partner. I think we are happy with the model as it is. This is a longstanding partnership. It's horizon lot of different name changes. We like the assets. We like the footprint that DCP has and the areas that they are offering in and they have had a great year just in terms of getting their order in terms of reducing their cost structure, pulling in the capital expenses and running much better. And they are actually running well this year from the reliability standpoint. They had just done all the right things, so it's a great assets. So we would be very happy to stay in a 50:50 JV.","Brad Heffern","Okay. Thanks. ","Operator","Faisel Khan from Citigroup Global Markets is online with a question. Your line is open.","Faisel Khan","Thanks. Good afternoon. On the Cedar Bayou project Tim I only see the start-up sort of second half of the next year, but are there certain parts of the plant that are going to start up before the main cracker comes online or how is the start-up going to be sort of sequenced?","Timothy Taylor","Yes. So just to be clear the crackers at Cedar Bayou the derivative polyethylene units are down at Sweeny and so two existing operation. So the polyethylene plants will be starting up in advance several months in front of the cracker. Now if it gets to the cracker you will be starting up utility systems steam those kind of things energizing but you really need the furnaces and the whole cracker in operation before you get production. So it's really the issue derivatives first then the cracker, but within the cracker there are number of systems that start to come up in advance of the hydro carbon into for the feed system.","Faisel Khan","Okay got it. The derivatives plant at Sweeny, you said several months ahead if you put that sometime in the first or second I guess second quarter?","Timothy Taylor","Second quarter is what we looking at schedule and everything we are seeing. So that's still the good time for mechanical completion.","Faisel Khan","Okay, makes sense. And on the partnership is the preference to still billed and then drop I know you have got some organic with projects taking place at the partnership but I am just trying to figure out how you are balancing sort of the bill that the parent an then drop at the partnership versus the organic growth of the partnership is there enough sort of internal cash flow generation at the partnership to fund all the growth?","Timothy Taylor","Faisel, when you think about the size of MLP to-date and it would be \u2013 it's hard to carry a multi-year, multi-billion dollar project there even though it makes sense. So I think as the partnership get bigger we are going to shift more and more of the CapEx to the partnership and you have seen that this year with additional acquisitions, organic builds on the Bayou bridge pipe etcetera. So I think that's the progression overtime. But we can look at it as total midstream business and what\u2019s the right way to drive the project that creates value for the company and then you can decide if you will the financing between the two. But I think longer term we would like to see the partnership doing more and more there.","Faisel Khan","Okay. And as you think about the partnership in the long run what percentage of the revenues do you think will come from third parties sort of on that $2.3 billion number that you have out there. I think in the past you talked about sort of number close to 50% or maybe less than that but I am just trying to understand if that number has changed at all?","Timothy Taylor","No, it's still in that range. I mean a lot of what we have done to-date in the partnership has been existing systems that are really related to our infrastructure and our refining and the existing midstream business. And as you go forward with as Phillips 66 built additional projects, some of the new things like the Bayou bridge pipe, if we already end up there fractionation is through third party. So that's where that shift begins to get where you start to drive it up, where you have a more balanced portfolio between internal PSX and third party income that's in the midstream and the MLP space.","Faisel Khan","Okay, got you. On the refining side the - have you gotten any more traction on the rail facility at Santa Maria associated with the pipeline still down. Have you been able to sort of solve the feedstock issue there to sort of get your capture rate so your realization is back to where they should be?","Timothy Taylor","We are still impacted on the west coast with the pipeline outage. It's not \u2013 we have made progress through getting more crude incrementally in the Santa Maria via truck but not via rail. That's been a very difficult permitting process, so we continue to work that but it's all over the west coast any type of rail facility has really struggled from that permitting process. So ruling the pipe back in operation and we will continue to work that incrementally but it\u2019s still an impact in terms of our west coast operations that reduction that we are seeing say roughly 10,000-15,000 barrels a day of incremental capacity that's still a burden so to speak because we can't fully utilize our Bayou Santa Maria system.","Faisel Khan","Is there a situation where you have to shut down one of the plants or you are still comfortable running the whole system the way it is?","Timothy Taylor","Well, I think longer term we always have to look at that but right now we still think it will eventually get that supply back. It's just the question of when. So we want to run that as a system when we do that.","Faisel Khan","Got you. Last question from me on M&A related to refineries. Is there ever a situation where you would consider buying a refinery in the lower 48, I just want to ask the question I know historically it's been no, but say there are few assets for sale I just want to ask the question here?","Greg Garland","So I think historical answer is still a good answer for us. So we are not in a hunt for anyone that are for sale today. Yes having said that if we could find the right assets for the right value certainly we would look at it, but none of the ones that are on the market today we are not in a hunt for those.","Faisel Khan","Got it. Thanks for the time guys.","Greg Garland","You bet. Take care.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Rosy Zuklic.","Rosy Zuklic","Thank you Julie and thank you all for your interest in Phillips 66, if anyone has any additional questions please give C.W. or I a call.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Clayton Reasor, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Affairs. Please go ahead.","C. Clayton Reasor","Thank you. Good morning, welcome to Phillips 66 first quarter earnings conference call. With me this morning are Chairman and CEO, Greg Garland; CFO, Greg Maxwell; and EVP, Tim Taylor.","Presentation material we\u2019ll be using this morning can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental, financial, and operating information.","Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It\u2019s a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from today\u2019s comments and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here on the second page of this presentation as well as in our filings with the SEC. Also you may know that on March 27, our registration statement relating to the securities of Phillips 66 Partners LP was filed with the SEC. As this statement has not became effective our remarks about the MLP will be limited and we will not take questions on this proposed offering during today\u2019s call.","That said, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg Garland for some opening remarks, Greg?","Greg C. Garland","","Thanks Clayton, good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. It\u2019s hard to believe that just a year ago that we launched Phillips 66 as an independent company. We are pleased with our performance today. We are a new company, but we are built on a 130 years of experience. We have a portfolio of business that is as uniquely positioned to benefit from the significant growth in American oil, gas, natural gas liquids production.","First quarter 2013, we operated safely. And our financial results reflect the fact that we captured positive market conditions in our refining and chemicals businesses. Operating excellence continues to be our top priority. We aspire to be a company where employees work their entire careers without getting hurt. In the first quarter, we continued our improvement in our safety and environmental performance.","We continue to pursue growth in high value businesses while maintaining our capital discipline. Our plans for a new natural gas liquids fractionator in the Gulf Coast region demonstrate investment opportunities we have in the American energy landscape as well as highlight our unique position across the downstream value chain. The plans DCP has announced are additional important sources of growth within our midstream segment.","The Sand Hills and Southern Hills pipelines will deliver NGL to the growing Gulf Coast markets and are expected to be fully in service by mid-2013. CPChem continues to advance its Gulf Coast ethane cracker and polyethylene facilities, once complete these facilities are estimated to create about 400 long-term direct jobs and about 10,000 temporary engineering, construction jobs.","Growth in our chemical segment also comes from an NGL frac expansion at Sweeny, our 1-hexene project, and our Saudi Polymers project. Ultimately the growth in capacity allows for growth of dividends and share repurchases. Shareholder distributions remain a priority for our company.","During the quarter, we paid an increased dividend and we repurchased $382 million of stock, as part of our $2 billion share repurchase program. Since the company\u2019s inception a year ago, we\u2019ve returned $1.2 billion of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","We have a diverse portfolio that provides us earnings durability as well as a balance sheet that give us financial flexibility. These are two very important traits that are needed in our industry to be well positioned to weather the cyclicity that\u2019s inherent in our business and continue to grow shareholder distributions and value through the cycles.","With that said, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Greg Maxwell to take you through the quarter results.","Greg G. Maxwell","","Thanks, Greg and good morning everyone. We had a very solid first quarter driven by strong refining and chemical margins. Reported and adjusted earnings both came in at the $1.4 billion level with earnings per share at $2.23 on a reported basis and adjusted earnings per share at $2.19. Excluding changes in working capital, cash from operations for the quarter was $1.8 billion, our cash flow generation enabled us to fund our capital program, pay $194 million of dividends and repurchased $382 million of common stock during the quarter. On an adjusted basis, our annualized 2013 return on capital employed was 20%.","Before we leave this slide, I\u2019d like to mention one key item. As outlined in our earnings release we made a few changes to how we report our operating segments. This is in response to changes in our internal reporting processes and is designed to increase transparency and ensure better alignment with how we think about operate and manage our business. We are moving from having four segments to five with our Refining and Marketing segment being split into two new operating segments, Refining standing on its own and Marketing and Specialties. In addition a portion of our transportation assets that were previously reported in our refining and marketing segment had been separated and are being reported as a part of midstream.","Our slides reflect this new segmentation and prior year numbers have been recast for comparative purposes. In addition the quarterly information for 2012 has been recast and is included in our supplemental pages provided with the earnings release. Full year 2009 and 2010, as well as quarterly 2011 recast numbers will be available later in the second quarter and will be posted to our website.","Slide 5 provides a look at our first quarter adjusted earnings compared to the first quarter of 2012, adjusted earnings increased by over $600 million to $1.4 billion. Midstream adjusted earnings were $83 million and this excludes a $27 million gain from the issuance of additional limited partner units by DCP Midstream partners which is DCP's MLP. The majority of the $25 million decline in earnings is driven primarily by lower NGL prices. ","Chemicals earnings were $282 million, this was up $65 million mainly due to higher margins especially in olefins and polyolefins. Refining generated over $900 million in adjusted earnings and the $455 million increase was mainly due to stronger margins that benefited from higher markets spreads for distillates and gasoline along with improved feedstock advantage.","Marketing and specialties had adjusted earnings of $202 million an improvement of nearly $150 million over last year. Higher margins were responsible for most of this improvement. ","And finally corporate and other costs this quarter were $95 million and this $25 million higher largely due to interest expense on debt taken on in 2012 related to the separation. I will cover each of these segments in more detail later in the webcast.","Moving next to our first quarter cash flow, during the quarter we generated $1.8 billion in cash from operations, excluding working capital changes. Changes in working capital were a positive impact of $400 million with the net change primarily due to the timing of tax payments. We funded about $400 million of capital expenditures and investments and during the quarter we returned $576 million to the shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4.8 billion.","As for our capital structure on slide 7, at quarter-end we had equity of $21 billion and our debt was $7 billion resulting in our debt to capital ratio remaining in the middle of our targeted range of 20% to 30%, taking into account our $4.8 billion ending cash balance, our net debt to capital ratio was 9% at the end of the first quarter.","Next we will cover each of our operating segments in more detail, starting with Midstream on slide 8. As mentioned earlier the Midstream segment now includes our transportation assets in addition to our equity interest in DCP Midstream and our NGL operations. The transportation business includes pipelines, terminals, railcars, and trucks that were previously embedded as a part of our R&M segment. The annualized return on capital employed for Midstream was 11% based on an average capital employed of $3.1 billion.","Slide 9 shows Midstream\u2019s adjusted earnings of $83 million along with the variances from the prior year for the three main business lines.","Adjusted earnings from DCP Midstream decreased by $31 million this quarter primarily due to lower NGL prices and to a lesser degree reduced volumes. NGL prices continue to be challenged down 26% compared to the first quarter of 2012. The volume decrease was in part due to mechanical and also to weather-related issues. ","NGL operations earnings were down $10 million partly due to inventory impacts from exiting the wholesale propane marketing business that occurred during the first quarter of 2013. Transportation was up $16 million mainly due to new and increased throughput fees as we started converting our pipelines to market rates. Additional information on the transportation business line can be found in the midstream section of our reporting supplement.","On the next slide, we will move to a discussion of our chemical segment. Our chemical segment had another solid quarter. The olefins and polyolefins business continued to benefit from strong margins. The capacity utilization rate this quarter for O&P was 91% and it was negatively impacted by the power outage at the Sweeny facility and the continuing ramp up of operations of the Saudi Polymers Company joint venture.","In Specialties, Aromatics & Styrenics, benzene margins improved however this was mostly offset by additional turnarounds during the quarter. The annualized return on capital employed for our chemical segment was 31% and this is based on an average capital employed of $3.6 billion.","As shown on slide 11 first quarter earnings increased by $65 million compared to the same period last year. The increase in earnings was primarily in olefins and polyolefins due to stronger margins, as well as higher equity earnings from CPChem's Middle Eastern joint ventures. This increase was slightly offset by higher cost partly due to the power outage at the Sweeny Facility during the first quarter.","As mentioned earlier, Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics earnings were flat compared with last year. The improvement of $12 million noted in corporate and others due to lower SG&A cost along with reduced interest expenses are a result of CPChem\u2019s debt retirements in 2012.","As we move next to refining, our refining realized margin was $13.94 per barrel with a global crude utilization rate of 90% and a clean product yield of 84%. Our utilization rate this quarter was negatively impacted by turnarounds at the Sweeny and Wood River refineries, as well as the power outage at Sweeny.","We increased our advantage crude slate in the U.S. during the quarter to 68% and this is up from 60% in the first quarter of 2012. The annualized return on capital employed for the refining segment was 25% with an average employed for the segment of $14.3 billion.","Slide 13 provides more detail on earnings in our refining segment. Adjusted earnings for refining were $909 million this quarter. This is up $455 million from a year ago, reflecting improvements in all of our regions, especially in the Central Corridor and the Gulf Coast. The earnings of all four of our refining regions increased and in total this was primarily due to improved refining margins. The improvement in refining margins reflects not only higher market crack spreads, but also positive feedstock advantage.","Atlantic Basin\/Europe reflects improved margins due to higher market cracks and also feedstock advantage at our Bayway Refinery as we increased our effort to run more Bakken crude in place of Brent. Gulf Coast improved as we achieved 114% market capture rate up from 77% in the first quarter of last year.","Central Corridor reflects higher market cracks and wider Canadian crude differentials as well as benefits from running additional low cost domestic crudes in our Wood River Borger, Ponca City and Billings refineries. Western Pacific\u2019s improvement of $61 million over last year is largely due to the fact that the first quarter of 2012 was a heavy turnaround period for our West Coasts refineries.","Ferndale, Los Angeles and San Francisco all had turnarounds in the first quarter of 2012. Finally, other refinery, refining was up this quarter compared to last year primarily as a result of margin improvements on movements of Western Canadian crude that was in excess of our refinery needs.","Let\u2019s now take a look at our market capture shown on slide 14. Here we compare the weighted average market 3:.2:1 margin against the actual margin we captured along with the factors that drove the differences between them. The realized margin for the first quarter of 2013 was $13.94 per barrel and this is our best first quarter realized refining margin in recent history.","Market capture for the quarter was 90% down from our fourth quarter high of 97%, but well above the 81% utilization achieved in the first quarter of 2012. Market capture in the first quarter was strong as feedstock advantage, product differential impacts, and volume gains more than offset the negative impacts associated with lower price secondary products.","Slide 15, shows the comparison of advantage crude runs at our refineries as well as clean product yields for 2011, 2012 and year-to-date 2013. In the U.S. advantage crudes increased from 62% in 2012 to 68% in 2013. The decrease in other heavy crude from 27% in 2012 to 23% for the first quarter of 2013 was largely due to our Sweeny Refinery being down during part of the first quarter. ","As shown on the graph to the right, we continue to focus on improving our clean product yields, achieving an overall 84% yield across our refining system is quarter. ","This next slide covers Marketing & Specialties or M&S. M&S includes Phillips 66's wholesale and retail fuel marketing, as well as our lubricants, power generation and flow improver businesses. In marketing another, worldwide marketing margins improved to $0.03 per gallon in the first quarter. This was up from $0.01 per gallon in the first quarter of 2012. ","In specialties compared to last year our flow improver sales increased by 16% on a volume basis. The annualized return on capital employed for M&S was 22% and the average capital employed was $3.7 billion.","Slide 17, provides some additional detail about the marketing and specialties segment. M&S generated adjusted earnings of $202 million. This was $147 million higher than the same quarter last year. Marketing and others adjusted earnings increased over $150 million, largely due to improved margins over the prior year. Both U.S. and international marketing margins contributed to this increase with the U.S. representing approximately 75% of this improvement. For specialties, the $6 million decrease over last year was mainly attributed to inventory impacts.","This concludes my discussion of the financial and operational results for the quarter. I will now cover a few outlook items before handing the call over to Tim Taylor for some closing remarks.","In refining, for the second quarter, we expect a global utilization rate to be in the high 90s. ","With regard to turnarounds, our pretax turnarounds expense is expected to be approximately $90 million in the second quarter. Corporate and other costs are expected to be about approximately $105 million after-tax for the quarter and the total company\u2019s effective income tax rate is expected to be in the low 30s.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Tim. ","Timothy G. Taylor","Thank you, Greg. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to review our expectations for the remainder of 2013. We continue to focus on growth and returns enhancements centered on opportunities created by the rise of oil and gas production in North America. In our midstream business, we are pursuing developments at 100,000 barrels per day NGLs fractionator to be located in the Gulf Coast region. And this project would enable us to take advantage of existing midstream transportation and storage infrastructure.","We see excellent market facing opportunities to grow the NGL business and the chance to supply 30 NGLs and liquefied petroleum gas to the petrochemical industry as well heating markets. If approved, we would expect construction to start in the first half of 2014 with the operations commencing in the second half of 2015.","Our 2013 budgeted capital expenditures and investments are currently expected to be about $1.9 billion of which $1 billion is dedicated for maintenance capital. ","As we\u2019ve said before, we see this level set right around our DD&A amount going forward. Included in our maintenance capital are our capital requirements for Tier 3 implementation. During the quarter, we funded nearly $400 million of our capital program and nearly $800 million if you include a portion of our major joint venture expenditures. This capital was spend mainly on the growth plans that we have outlined before where we are expanding our higher value businesses.","As Greg said in his opening remarks, we are in a cyclical business and we are well positioned to capture opportunities caused by both short-term price dislocations, as well as medium and long-term fundamentals.","The Brent WTI differential will be dynamic as infrastructure progresses and trade flows adjust over the coming months and we expect LLS to move back to a discount versus Brent. Although we may see some narrowing of crude differentials as takeaway capacities build, we still have an advantage position. ","With seven coastal refineries, three each in the Gulf and the West Coast and one on the East Coast, we are well-positioned to grow product exports, and this past quarter we exported an average of 150,000 barrels a day of refined products which is a significant increase over last year.","With that, we\u2019ll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hey, good morning. Congratulations on the results and thanks for all the disclosure. It\u2019s going to keep me up tonight, so my wife is going to be happy that I\u2019m inside an Excel spreadsheet, so let\u2019s start-off with some questions around that disclosure. Just on the midstream, you\u2019ve broken it out and you said you transferred all the assets in that. So you\u2019ve got $175 million in the first quarter of earnings before tax, you\u2019ve got around $19 million of DD&A, but there will be some see-through DD&A the why I think about it atleast in DCP Midstream, which doesn\u2019t come through say another $40 million. You got to sort of over, maybe call it $230 million of EBITDA see-through for that division for the quarter implying around $900 million to a $1 billion for the year. Is that a fair way to think about the overall Midstream EBITDA at PSX?","Greg G. Maxwell","Yeah, I think Ed, you\u2019re correct. When we look at that, we think that\u2019s about with the combined results about the right amount of EBITDA for that segment.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Right, okay, thanks, just walking through some Maths there. And then a totally separate topic, RINs, it\u2019s come up obviously on every conference call. Where do you see the exposure if you assume that the current RIN price persisted say into next year or into this year? Do you have a dollar million assessments at this point? Thanks.","Timothy G. Taylor","Yeah, this is Tim and I\u2019ll start with that. I think that, when I think about RINs to me it\u2019s obviously a cause to the impacts the way we go to market in our sales channel. And so, I think fundamentally we manage that through our commercial business, we have a lot of options. We\u2019ve taken lot of actions to increase blending on bio-diesel at our terminals et cetera to mitigate that that said when you look out what the blend wall going forward you realize that that\u2019s still an issue yet to be addressed, it has be addressed really from a macro standpoint, but to this point we find that manageable it does effect our planning, but I think that the real issue really starts to surface in 2014 with the additional requirements and a need for advanced cellulosics that\u2019s just are not there.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","","I mean, if I could push you a little obviously, Valero has given some numbers where they bracketed around a range of 500 to 750 from memory. Is there a number you feel comfortable sharing if and then I say basically persisting market conditions from here to the end of the year?","Greg G. Maxwell","","This is Greg. I would say first of all, as we look out, we think it\u2019s just an unworkable program. And we have seen this coming since 2007 and we have been trying to position ourselves for this. I think the industry is working hard on solutions in Washington. But that said, we are trading RINs and like any other commercial activity, we really don\u2019t want to expose our positions because we think it puts our traders at a disadvantage. But I will say, our view is that the industry and particularly us we believe, we are capturing most of the cost of the RINs in the market today.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, Good morning guys. The new disclosure is definitely helpful. First question, one of the two areas I think where you are differentiating growth profile is in the midstream and you mentioned Sand Hills and Southern Hills are set to ramp in mid 2013 which is pretty soon with aggregate 375,000 barrels a day of [white] [ph] grade capacity in the Mt. Belvieu. I mean, can you discuss, are you taking to, are you planning on taking some of those post fractionated volumes at your facilities and displacing third party purchases and I just, how you see the demand for these volumes and how does it work in your system?","Greg C. Garland","So, a lot of the volumes or 70% of the volumes are DCP controlled volumes and the balance is third-party volumes on Sand Hills. We don\u2019t see that displacing any of the internal volumes that we have. As we go to market with those volumes, as you know DCP is a large supplier to CPChem and we like that relationship and we see that relationship continuing going forward. But we look at those projects kind of on a standalone basis. We think we got good value capture. We think we get the assets loaded over some period of time, but relatively quickly and those are going to be good solid assets for us.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That\u2019s great. And switching gears into chemicals, Saudi Polymers facility continues to ramp. I mean, should we expect the full contribution in the third quarter? And I guess I\u2019m trying to assess where you are in that 10% to 15% earnings lift once the plant is fully ramped.","Greg C. Garland","So, I think we talked on the last call that we\u2019re working through operational problems. It\u2019s running much better this past quarter. So it continues to progress. So our view is that, yes, in the second half of this year you really start to see the impact from the Saudi Polymers plant startup.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. Maybe a last one if I could. I know you gave a global utilization in O&P at 91% and you mentioned that the U.S. is affected by downtime at Sweeny. I mean, can you give us the U.S. rate and kind of where we think that might normalize?","Greg C. Garland","Yeah, looks like in this last year, 96% and I would, our view is ethylene unit rates up 95% to 100%. That\u2019s pretty much on a sustained basis running flat out. So, I think on the U.S. side that really we would expect that to run at capacity in that 95% to 100% range.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. And where did you run in the first quarter?","Greg C. Garland","In the U.S. we were in, I believe the, 90%, 95%.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","Good morning","Greg C. Garland","","Good morning.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","","In the press release this morning you mentioned that you took delivery of 400 railcars. I believe that\u2019s out of 2,000 expected. Are these general purpose railcars or [coil] [ph] tubes and could talk about how you plan to deploy these cars, and where the greatest opportunities are in the current market?","Greg C. Garland","So they are general purpose cars. This is order we placed shortly after we formed as the new company and we expect to kind of get the 2,000 cars ratably over the balance of this year. I think the plan really hasn\u2019t changed for us. It really was primarily envisioned to be Bakken East and West and I think our view is that we\u2019ll continue to do that.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","Secondly, on a second topic quarter-to-date many of the regional cracks are down sequentially and most are down year-on-year. Some of the crude differentials have softened a bit. Perhaps they are bringing in some incremental imports opening for Gulf Coast imports. What do you think the major drivers of the softness in cracks are and do you expect this weakness to continue to the summer?","","Greg C. Garland","So, on the crack spread, I think you\u2019ve got both that work. You\u2019ve had some market fundamentals on the product side that have continued. First quarter is typically not the strongest and second quarter should see some seasonal uplift on the product side. But so really I think what\u2019s moving around are the crude dips and you\u2019ve looked at the first quarter. They\u2019ve come in and you looked recently you started to see some widen and back out. So I think our fundamental view is that that the fundamentals haven\u2019t changed, that we still see the discounts with Inland crudes, we still see the Canadian discounts. We do believe though that it will remain volatile and that we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see those come back out a bit from where they\u2019ve been in the last month, may not be as high as what we saw or as much volatility as last year, but we still believe that those dis on the Canadian and the Inland crudes are very sustainable, and I think we\u2019re in a period of readjustment here in the Gulf Coast as those crudes make their way into Texas and then ultimately find their way into the rest of the refining system on the Gulf Coast.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. And I guess my thanks as well for the disclosure and I had a question as well on it. On the transportation segment, I appreciate your breaking that out. It looks like last year on a full year basis you had just over $250 million of EBITDA. If we annualize the first quarter you\u2019re over $360 million. Is the delta there just taking some of the tariffs to a market-based tariff from an internal cost accounting? And then, can you also discuss what may or may not be included in that transport segment. I\u2019m pretty sure it does not include all your, what we may call, logistics assets, but if you have any color there that would be great.","Greg C. Garland","","So, Arjun, part of the 2012 result included impairments around the REX pipeline.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah.","Greg C. Garland","So you probably need to add those back in if you want to get a more reasonable number, but you\u2019ve got what $170 million in the second quarter and $160 million, I guess. So what is that $300 million, $330 million of earnings you probably need to add back. I don\u2019t know. If Greg, if you ","Greg G. Maxwell","","From an asset perspective, Arjun, I think it was the other question. Some of the, what you would consider storage tanks and pipes that are inside the refinery gates, are still aligned with the refining segment. We\u2019re continuing to look at that, but you can imagine it\u2019s a little bit more integrated from an asset basis in that refinery aspect. So we\u2019re looking at that, but a lot of the storage and pipes inside the refinery gates are still being reported in the Refining segment.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Got it. So, yes. So those storage tanks and terminals might still be within the Refining segment. That makes sense. Did you change though the account of it from an internal cost accounting to a market-based tariff as you moved from 2012 to 2013 or is there no delta on that point?","Timothy G. Taylor","Arjun, it\u2019s Tim. There are some adjustments that have been made. Some of those were obviously at market. Some were more focused on the cost side. So this does reflect that movement now to, really across that system we\u2019re going to be going to the market-based adjustment rate. ","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. ","Timothy G. Taylor","So there was an uplift from that.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, great. And then, on the crude slate slide, I think it\u2019s slide 15. You described WTI-based in shale. I presume the shale is midcontinent and therefore effectively a WTI-based product or is there some reason you have it separated?","Timothy G. Taylor","Well, we like to really, WTI traditional mid-con production, I think we like to separate the shale, very focused thinking about Bakken, Eagle Ford and some of those that are really probably better described as light tide oil. And so, I think that\u2019s a distinction that we use to kind of help draw the distinction and really bring in new plays. Cleary WTI may have some expansion as well with the EMP activity, but that really helps, I think, highlight where the new source comes from.","Arjun Narayana Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then, just a quick final one. Have you guys given any consideration or plans to investing at the front-end to be able to process more light oil at some of the otherwise heavier refineries or do you not have an interest in doing that?","","Greg C. Garland","So, Arjun, it\u2019s Greg. Good morning.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi.","Greg C. Garland","Yeah, we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019ve done preliminary engineering around condensate splitter, standalone and also within the refineries. I think we\u2019re moving towards utilizing underutilized equipment in our refineries today to cheaply find a way to process more lights and we do have some projects identified, but these are small projects that I would say $50 million and less that are really kind of quick-hit projects that we can get implemented and get paid out fast. We don\u2019t envision, at this point, doing a standalone condensate splitter at some point.","Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","That\u2019s great. Thank you so much.","Greg C. Garland","","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bradley Olsen from Tudor Pickering. Please go ahead.","Brad Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Greg C. Garland","","Good morning.","Brad Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Question on your, you\u2019ve obviously done a lot to access more on sort of sales crudes that\u2019s coming through in the slides that you had in your presentation this morning, but there has been a pretty significant compression between Brent and WTI, and Brent and Bakken prices, which some previous questions hit on. Is there a price level or is there a sensitivity to your crude by rail operations or a price level or a price spread where it\u2019s no longer interesting economically to ship Bakken crude to Ferndale or to Bayway?","Greg C. Garland","","Yeah, certainly there is a point, which, again we\u2019ve said in the past that we look at Bakken to the East Coast, the West Coast maybe in that kind of all in from the well [that had] 12 to 16. So if you start getting that to come in too far obviously we\u2019d want to do that, but fundamentally that crude needs to go that direction. That\u2019s the right place I think for that crude to go. So I would see that as short-term dislocation versus really a fundamental, we still believe Bakken will price to be competitive and it\u2019s got to taking account where needs to go the price itself into the market.","Brad Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. In the LLS market, we\u2019ve seen this rally where LLS despite the increasing in Eagle Ford production and the flow is coming south down the Seaway. We\u2019ve seen LLS rally recently above current levels. Any comments as to what you\u2019re seeing in the market and whether or not Phillips has been able to maybe access crudes on the Gulf Coast at a discount to what we\u2019re seeing on our screens, when it comes to LLS pricing?","Greg C. Garland","Yeah, so LLS is our marker crude that we talked about in the Gulf Coast region and we\u2019ve been successful really having additional penetration particularly with Eagle Ford crudes as well as some supplements from some of the other mid-con crudes into that region. And I think the way, I would be explain that is that I think you look back at our Marine option that we\u2019ve taken on the MR tankers put in service. And that\u2019s drilling as access Texas crude over to Alliance and Lake Charles. And so I think really what you\u2019re still seeing is probably some reduction in LLS over the past quarter. And then you got the transportation bottleneck from Texas to Louisiana that ultimately get solved. But I think as a result of that you\u2019re relatively indifferent right now on LLS versus some of the imported grades. But we still think fundamentally as that crude shows up into the Gulf Coast that you\u2019ll begin to see that discount.","Brad Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. And a question on the chemical side, the $8 billion opportunity you said that was sighted in the presentation. I might have my numbers wrong. But that sounded a little bit higher than the roughly $6 billion figure that I think have been discussed in the past, are there any specific projects on the chemical side that\u2019s driving that number up to $8 billion.","Greg C. Garland","That\u2019s a multi year look the big piece of that is the new ethylene cracker and associated derivative plans on the petrochemical space but it also includes smaller interim closuring projects with the fractionator expansion at Sweeny, the 1-hexene plant, and some other kinds of more smaller project, but the big driver is that project in the petrochemical complex here in the Gulf Coast.","Greg G. Maxwell","And Brad of course that\u2019s a gross number, CPChem level right.","Greg C. Garland","","Correct, right, ","Brad Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Yeah, sure and just one last one, you guys announced midstream a project on the midstream side to help tackle the fractionation shortage that\u2019s developing on the Gulf Coast, as you look into the NGL market, where you guys are obviously very active. Do you have any thoughts on potentially addressing the lack of export capacity that we have been experiencing on the Gulf Coast especially in light of recent announcements by companies out there to bring large batches of Marcellus LPGs down to the Gulf Coast and that\u2019s it for me, thanks guys.","Greg C. Garland","So, yeah I think we said previously that we\u2019re looking at a multi product export facility on the Gulf Coast, it could include condensate LPG, even refined products, and so I would say we are in the feasibility stage on that project and looking to move that forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Hey good morning guys.","Greg C. Garland","Good morning.","Greg G. Maxwell","Good morning.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","A number of quick question on East Coast your deal with global partner, do you have any flexibility not to take the oil to Bayway, but to other location or that 50,000 barrel per day have to go to Bayway contractually?","Greg G. Maxwell","It\u2019s really focused on Bayway. It makes a lot of sense that I think ultimately you can have some flexibility, but we\u2019ve certainly seen the advantage and that where we would intend to use that. ","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Tim, on when that contract startup?","Timothy G. Taylor","So that became effective right at the beginning of the year. ","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Beginning of this year, right?","Timothy G. Taylor","Correct. ","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","And that on, I think that you guys have been discussing about bringing the heavy oil to California wherein some of your competitor that are looking at somewhat different option by rail, the heavy oil maybe into or that the light oil into Pacific Northwest and then budget on. So wondering that, whether that maybe an option you guys will be interested or that you will stick to primarily looking at to well heavy oil from Canada to California. And if that is still option that you\u2019re current expect to, any status update that you can provide?","Timothy G. Taylor","Sure, it\u2019s really a multifaceted approach on in looking at bidding different crude slate to the West Coast. So today we are doing some large movements down the coast into California on heavy Canadian. And you can look in the Northwest to do that, so that\u2019s an option that we\u2019re going to continue to use, and that we\u2019re looking at expanding an opportunity with some of the logistic things we\u2019re putting in place, and we\u2019re also continuing to move crude by rail in smaller amounts into California and looking at projects really to increase that as well.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","And well maybe this is for Greg, Greg can you give me some balance sheet data, what is your working capital, the inventory, market value in excess of the both and also the long term, I\u2019d presume that is long-term.","Greg G. Maxwell ","The replacement value and excess of LIFO Paul is $8.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, and then working capital?","","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes.","","Greg G. Maxwell ","We had at the end of the first quarter $16.4 billion of current assets and right at $15 billion of current liabilities.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","And all of that is now long-term debt, right?","Greg G. Maxwell ","That excludes the long term debt, long-term debt sat at, right at $7 billion. We did reclassify some of that I think, now we left at $7 billion.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, so long-term debt is $7 billion. Greg, and given that expected pretty heavy capital only from CPC so we assume that any dividend payment from CPC to the parent corporation will be quite minimum until that order at least that Gulf Coast cracker is complete.","Greg G. Maxwell ","Yeah, Paul so I mean we had given guidance I think in our December meeting that the capital expenditure program for CPChem is going to be the neighborhood of $1.2 billion if you look at their EBITDA, last year it was about $3 billion, so we think there is going to be nice distributions back from the chemical company to both of the owners this year.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, two final question. Greg can you remind me what is the liquidity need for you to run your business? What is the level that you feel comfortable.","Greg G. Maxwell","That we are honing in on that Paul, we look at leading cash in somewhat in the neighborhood of $3 million to $4 billion. We\u2019re comfortable with our current liquidity uncommitted credit facilities that are $5.2 billion, $4 billion on revolving credit facility and $1.2 billion associated with our account receivables securitization facility, and you\u2019re are aware that we use some of that liquidity to as a basis for back stopping our letters of credit. I think at the end of the first quarter, we had about $200 million associated with LCs.","","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","So, with your cash position at 4.7 though I think that is clearly that you\u2019re in excess of what you need to run your position and even though margin have come down, you\u2019re still generating tons of free cash, wondering that is there any plan of accelerating the cash return to the shareholder.","Greg C. Garland","First, now I\u2019ll turn to Greg, I recall that we\u2019ve committed to paying $1 billion of our short-term debt eliminating the short-term debt by the end of the year. So, that\u2019s $1 billion of expected cash usage, and then I\u2019ll let Greg respond to the distribution aspect.","Greg G. Maxwell ","So, dividends are highly important to us, Paul and I know you\u2019re a big supporter of dividends, and I think you should what expect us to increase the dividend this year, we do want to get on annual cycle of dividend increases. We\u2019ve always said, we want to pay a competitive dividend when never we want a back up from it, when we look back in 10 years and say we\u2019ve increased the dividend every year very important to us. We\u2019ve confirmed our previous guidance on capital expenditures at the P66 level this year. So I think, then when you think about the capital discipline around what were going from capital investment standpoint, to the extend that we\u2019re going to generate excess cash, then it will go against our existing $2 billion share repurchase program that we\u2019ve talked about.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","A final one. Tim, I think that there is one potential option in terms of the transportation side to well the bitumen directly down to the Gulf Cost and then return [core] to bring the condensate up to their broader area given there\u2019s a natural position there. Have you guys looked at that as a possibility and if you have any kind of cost estimate, if you do a wrong shipping like that, what maybe the cost compared to pipeline cost may look like?","Timothy G. Taylor","I haven\u2019t done it specifically for that. But we are, that I could recall, but we are looking at that. Clearly you give (inaudible) on the way down. You can send it back up for the pipeline movement and so you get a better look. But we really haven\u2019t looked specifically at that as something that we\u2019re really pushing on hard at this point. The pipeline solution still longer-term is the right solution of our marine movement on the Canadian.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Greg C. Garland","","I think you let me factor for us, Paul, is really the heated, the coal cars and that\u2019s true probably for the industry. ","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","I see. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Faisel from Citi. Just a question on the refining side, the other refining income. You guys talked about it a little bit in your prepared remarks, but it\u2019s a big swing in the fourth quarter, the first quarter from $58 million to $182 million and can you talk about that little bit. I think you said it was related to selling excess Canadian heavy into the market and can you discuss how that works now that\u2019s going to trend going forward?","Timothy G. Taylor","","This is Tim. So basically, I think that that results from our positions on our Canadian takeaway. And so we\u2019re the largest importer of Canadian crudes and so when we have an excess we\u2019re able to capture that value and that\u2019s really was a very significant factor in the first quarter for us.","Greg C. Garland","","And because those benefits go across several regions rather than attributing it to the mid-con or Gulf Coast, we spread it over the entire segment.","Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Okay. So was that mostly a spread benefit or was it the fact that you ran less Western Canadian crude in the quarter in your system.","Timothy G. Taylor","Primarily a spread benefit, that group also contains some of our commercial activities beyond that as well. So it\u2019s a combination of things in that matter. ","Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay. Got it, and just looking at your cash flow statement your undistributed earnings swung to a positive number, is that what you talked about earlier that you expect to take distributions from CPChem during the course of this year even though you\u2019re investing heavily in the business? Is that a trend we should see throughout the entire year for a positive sort of impact from undistributed earnings?","Greg C. Garland","","At CPChem we\u2019re moving. Remember last year we paid off the debt at CPChem and so distributions were significantly reduced last year from CPChem. And this year given what we think the chemicals business is, the margin of the chemicals business, we think there is going to be good cash generation in that business. We\u2019ve got $1.2 billion at the CPChem level, capital spend. And so, I think you would continue to see distribution in excess there from what we\u2019ve seen previously last year.","Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Okay. Got it. And back at CPChem with the expansion of your facilities. Do you have all the permits now in place or how much longer are we waiting for the permits to proceed with the expansion that you guys talked about in the Gulf Coast for the base chemical, commodity chemical crackers?","Timothy G. Taylor","","Yeah, so the permitting process has been well underway for sometime and we made good progress for kind of reaching the end, because we\u2019re looking to take final investment decisions that in the third quarter. So, I think I\u2019d give you some indication of where we are on that and to this point, that\u2019s not been an issue.","Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, got it. And then with the NGL fractionation project that you guys are talking about is that designed to coincide with the chemical facility to supply feedstock facilities. So I guess is there kind of an agreement. Will there be any potential agreement between the fractionator and that chemical project within the joint venture?","Greg C. Garland","So, I think we\u2019ve said in the past we\u2019re kind of look at balances, we\u2019re pretty balanced. There is obviously an increased demand, but it doesn\u2019t specifically tie to that Chem project, but it certainly on the macro level is a nice matchup when we do that.","Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, got it. And as going back to the midstream questions from earlier in the call, there were kind of a lot of numbers that were throwing out. But I just want to make sure, I understand the numbers. So excluding DCP Midstream, if I am looking at the midstream income before taxes, I see NGL operations are $50 million, transportation income of $73 million, and D&A of roughly $19 million. So it seems like it\u2019s roughly $100 million of EBITDA kind of associated with the NGL operations and transportation excluding DCP Midstream is that the right number. As I heard a $200 million number and $300 million number earlier on the call, I just want to make sure looking at that correctly.","Greg C. Garland","So looking just at Phillips 66 operations, you would want to take the NGL Ops and the transportation number, that\u2019s very specific to the P66.","Greg G. Maxwell","That\u2019s $20 million of depreciation right.","Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, got it and then last question from me, just on tax, just what\u2019s your guidance for the tax rate for the rest of this year.","Greg G. Maxwell","","We\u2019re looking at the low 30s I would suggest something at 30%, 32% range.","Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, understood, is that a sustainable tax rate sort of all has been equal for the business?","Greg G. Maxwell","","Yeah,, I think it\u2019s a fair raid at least as we look out through 2013, sometimes as you are aware, some adjustments come in and introduce some release, but I think 32% is a fair number.","Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, got it. I really appreciate the time, thank you.","Unidentified Company Representative","No, problem thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, everybody, and just a second everyone, thanks for the disclosure that you offer. Could I just slightly pick around in slide 15 please, which is very interesting summary. You said and I think you remain committed to this idea that you\u2019ll keep your CapEx in line with your DD&A, is that the correct way of looking on a go forward basis? ","Greg G. Maxwell","We\u2019ll make our maintenance capital at\u2026","Greg C. Garland","","Maintenance capital\u2026."," ","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right, and then, so the overall levels that would be $1 billion and then the overall level of CapEx, could you talk a little bit, are you still going to turnkey that within the sort of $2 billion range or\u2026","Greg G. Maxwell","Yeah. We said 1.8 and I think 1.8., 1.9 something like that. I think 1.8 is on a cash basis.","Greg C. Garland","And $3.7 billion.","Greg G. Maxwell","And of course that excludes the capital that\u2019s been spend by DCP or CPChem.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Which is self financing, right?","Greg G. Maxwell","Exactly, exactly, but if you roll it all up, it\u2019s about $3.7 billion with\u2026","Greg C. Garland","","Proportionally consolidated with $1.8 billion being the Phillips 66 capital. ","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, I guess the point is that the previous levels of CapEx are about the same as what you\u2019re anticipating spending going forward. That was kind of my point. ","Greg C. Garland","Yeah.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So, allowing for that and you bring to the debt pay down and sensing about what you may do with cash, it sounds shareholders. I was just wondering in terms of the way this slate of crudes is shifted on the left hand side, and then to an extent on the right hand side, the yield is shifted. Would it be fair to say, that\u2019s a low hanging fruit kind of move and it would be hard to see an equivalent kind of continuation of the shift that you\u2019ve achieved going forward or do you anticipate that you can kind of continue those dynamics of obviously rising WTI based rising, Canadian rising, were actually down on the heavy, but then rising shale and collapsing Brent based. I guess what I am trying to get to is, is there a terminal point there?","Greg G. Maxwell","","There is, but we\u2019re not there yet, Paul. So our targets are 100% advantage crude and then you start taking advantage crudes and replacing it with more advantage crudes, i.e., in the Mississippi line or doing around Ponca City or displacing a WTI barrel with a better barrel, more consistent quality, better pricing. There is a theoretical limit on the clean product yields and so we\u2019re approaching that limit, but and then yeah, we\u2019re already high on distilled yields, industry leading distilled yield. So but there is still lot of room left in the fairway for us in terms of the advantage crude and the value capture for advantage crude. ","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Would the LLS I am assuming is in Brent basis?","Greg G. Maxwell","Yes.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, I guess, the next big thing is going to be, can you give us a sense to how much that\u2019s actually LLS and how much of that is actually Brent, the 32% that you got running burn rates?","Timothy G. Taylor","Sure, LLS clearly on the Gulf Coast and so very specifically, we haven't disclosed it by refinery, but I think if you think about our refining system you could see where that is. So that's really down the Gulf Coast and the Brent base for us would be [A&S]. It would be the other non-Bakken kind of crudes that we some times bring into Bayway, plus the LLS so it's kind of a mixture of things that really, rather California crudes are A&S based which ultimately is Brent-based as well. So I think you kind of look at regionally, you say, California, Bayway and then a portion of the Gulf Coast is where we see the Brent-based exposure in the U.S. ","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then you\u2019re saying, it\u2019s going to get to 100% advantage but would A&S be in that advantage target or...","Timothy G. Taylor","Yeah, so I think that we look at it and ultimately as we talk, we believe LLS with the movement of Mid-con to the Gulf Coast probably, just to be competitive will have to, will change. And then A&S, I think as now as the Bakken continues to move to northwest, as Canadian access to the West Coast improves you will see that as well. So that is certainly, as we talked about 100% target, there is a premise either to substitution or competition that we begin to get the advantage in those other crudes as well.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, and just and my point was that you think you can deal with this without any great expansion and capital, I mean, I think what you said is more or like $50 million type projects of changing access as opposed to any major surge in CapEx is required.","Timothy G. Taylor","","That's correct.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Was the timeframe on the 100% advantaged?","Greg C. Garland","","It keeps getting shorter.","Greg G. Maxwell","Yeah, that\u2019s correct.","Timothy G. Taylor","","I keep pressing it, yes it will take us a couple of years to probably get there I think all the way for us.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And basically I guess it will be a little bit, I mean you can see here there is a bit more gasoline than it was in 2011, but it\u2019s of the nature of like 0.5% more. Obviously that would\u2026","Timothy G. Taylor","","No, that\u2019s really I think that little bit of shift that you see in the first quarter is probably more to do with Sweeny down.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes.","Timothy G. Taylor","","That\u2019s correct first quarter versus running more light sweet crudes, where you would expect higher gasoline yields. That directionally, we don\u2019t want to give up this 41%, 42% distilling yields that we\u2019re generating in the refinery. So\u2026","Greg C. Garland","Yeah, probably work to our advantage because gas fracs were little better than they expanded.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Yeah, that\u2019s interesting. Okay, so, it\u2019s not a crude driven changing yields.","Greg C. Garland","","We had Sweeny down 49 days in the first quarter, for a turnaround and then the power outage that hit us there brought the whole complex down.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, what was that by the way because it\u2019s now looking like $1 million barrels of capacity down at that point right?","Greg C. Garland","","So, we lost all three feeds into this whole complex. So it impacted the refinery, it impacted the CPChem facilities and the frac, and to some degree actually impacted DCP also as we were trying to bring volumes down the easy line, which terminates at Sweeny, the frac, so\u2026","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Something we will do it, correct","Timothy G. Taylor","","We had a scheduled turnaround for February and that turnaround went well. And then as we were coming backup, we lost power and we were down for another week. So I think the number actually 47 days, when it was down, had a negative impact.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","What cause the outage?","Timothy G. Taylor","","System work that our utility supplier was going to actually upgrade their systems past the trip.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, okay. That\u2019s enough. Guys, thanks a lot. I appreciate your time. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Garcia from Raymond James. Please go ahead. ","Cory J. Garcia \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc. ","Good morning, fellows. One quick follow-up to this idea of bringing heavies into California, specifically the rail, the barge opportunities. Clearly some more associated costs with that element as well as the coal railcars is bit of an issue. But wondered how we should think about ultimately the cost structure on that aspect. Clearly the 12 to 16 of rail Bakken to Washington makes sense, but where does that go and even if you are able to pride up some sort of order of magnitude, where does that go and actually bring in those heavies from Canada into California?","Greg C. Garland","","Yeah, so you saw Atlanta in the supply chain. Clearly cost can move with time too as we do out the solution. So I think you\u2019ve got to see those discounts on the heavy, for instance, enough to offset that transportation, provide the quality differential and the incentive to run. So I still think it\u2019s in that range. You\u2019ve seen the WCS discount move out here recently, but I think that for Canadian crude it\u2019s probably still one of the further destination. So I think that just still continues to play in, but you\u2019ve got to see a significant discount to make that move that way, the transportation.","Cory J. Garcia \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So we\u2019re talking probably $20 plus type of discounts to be able to make it\u2026","Greg C. Garland","","It certainly works at that, yeah.","Cory J. Garcia \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, okay. And then, the Ferndale unloading facility that you guys are constructing, I guess, still in the permitting phase. Would that be a sole purpose for that thing or finally are you guys looking at expanding that into sort of a barge opportunity as well?","Greg C. Garland","So once it gets to Ferndale, certainly can support that operation, but then we have the opportunity to do barge as well or some of the vessel movement down the Coast if that made sense.","Cory J. Garcia \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So we\u2019ll have a multipurpose flexibility to it. Perfect. Thank you, guys","Greg C. Garland","","Okay. Thanks. ","Operator","And we have no further questions in queue. I\u2019ll turn the call back over.","C. Clayton Reasor","","Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate the interest. You can find the transcript of the presentation, also the Q&A. And certainly Rosy and I are available for any further follow-up questions.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Clayton Reasor, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Affairs. Mr. Reasor, you may begin.","Clayton Craig Reasor","Good morning, and welcome to the second quarter earnings conference call. We appreciate your interest in our company and are looking forward to giving you details on our financial operating results, update you on a few of our key strategic initiatives and provide an outlook for the rest of this year.","With me this morning are Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; and Greg Maxwell, Executive Vice President and CFO. Our presentation material and supplemental information is available on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website. As promised, we've increased the amount of disclosure and granularity in our reporting to help you model future earnings and see the value of Phillips 66.","Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It's a reminder that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during our question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we say today, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here on the second page as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Before we have Greg Maxwell get into the second quarter results, we thought it would be great if Greg Garland would give a welcome to you all and give a few opening comments. Greg?","Greg C. Garland","Thanks, Clayton. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us this morning. Today, we report out our initial quarterly results since the formation of Phillips 66. We're off to a solid start. The spend transaction was executed flawlessly. We think it's a real tribute to the dedication and the capability of our Phillips 66 employees. We are delivering on the financial and operating results we expected when the company was put together. And I'm really proud of what our employees have accomplished so far and have absolute confidence they will deliver industry-leading value creation. We have a clear strategy for growth, margin expansion and returns enhancement. And we think with the right balance between disciplined reinvestment and shareholder distributions, we expect our return on capital employed to improve over time. Our approach to capital allocation and balances are objectives for earnings growth while returning capital to shareholders. And we're demonstrating our commitment to shareholder distributions with the announcement in June regarding our first dividend, and this morning's announcement of a $1 billion share repurchase program.","We feel strongly that our strategy around returns, growth and distributions is the right one for our company, and we have advantaged assets, organizational capability and the opportunity set and commitment to drive differential value creation.","As Greg Maxwell reviews our second quarter results, you're going to hear that we operated with excellence, we ran well at high utilization rates and turned in a solid financial performance for the quarter, in what we've described as a positive margin environment.","So I'll now turn the call over to Greg, who will take you through our second quarter results.","Greg G. Maxwell","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. I'll get started with Slide 3. We successfully completed the separation with ConocoPhillips and began operating as an independent company on May 1. Our second quarter financials include 1 month of carve out financials and 2 months of actual financials. The financials for April were prepared on the same basis as our Form 10 and our first quarter 10-Q.","As stated in our earnings release, we had reported net income of $1.2 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. The $236 million difference is attributable to special items including impairments and gains on the asset sales. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the quarter were $2.23 per share. Cash from operations was $1.4 billion and our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed was 18%.","Now, let's turn to Slide 4 for a high-level look at our second quarter earnings. Refining and Marketing generated $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings. The $437 million improvement was primarily driven by much stronger refining margins, particularly in the U.S. Mid-Continent and Europe. Midstream adjusted earnings were $79 million, which excludes the $170 million special item associated with the impairment of our investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline.","On an adjusted basis, Midstream earnings were $32 million lower than the second quarter of last year. The decline in earnings reflects a reduction in equity earnings from DCP, which was primarily driven by lower NGL prices.","Chemicals adjusted earnings were $242 million, and this excludes a special item of $35 million associated with the early retirement of $600 million of debt. Adjusted earnings improved this quarter by $52 million, primarily due to higher margins and lower utility costs. I'll go through each of these operating segments in more detail later in the presentation.","Corporate and Other costs this quarter were $89 million after adjusting for repositioning costs of $30 million. Our Corporate and Other segment consists of interest expense, staff costs, technology and other items not specifically identifiable to an operating segment. Details on our Corporate segment can be found in the appendix of this presentation.","Next, let's take a look at cash flow for the second quarter as shown on Slide 5. I'll back up for a moment and remind you that our March 31 restricted cash balance of $6.1 billion includes $5.8 billion in senior notes that we issued in March. In April, we closed the financing on a $2 billion 3-year term loan, which brought our total debt balance to $8 billion.","As part of the separation, we made a net distribution of $6.1 billion to ConocoPhillips which has, as shown on the slide, effectively resulted in Phillips 66 starting out with $2 billion in cash. During the second quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations with a minor cash impact related to net working capital changes.","We generated proceeds of $234 million from asset sales, primarily from the sale of our Trainer Refinery. And our capital program this quarter was $270 million and was largely focused on the Refining and Marketing segment. This resulted in  $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter.","Let's turn to Slide 6 for a look at our capital structure and returns. At the end of the second quarter, we had $19 billion in equity and $8 billion of debt, for a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 30%. Our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed of 18% is up from 14% in 2011. This improvement is driven primarily by higher earnings in our Refining and Marketing segment and our Chemicals segment. And we ended the quarter with $27 billion in capital employed, of which R&M represented 76% of this total.","Next, we'll cover each of our segments in more detail, starting with Refining and Marketing, beginning on Slide 7. The story in Refining and Marketing this quarter was that we ran well during a strong margin environment. We ran globally at a 93% utilization rate, which is the highest second quarter rate we have achieved since 2008. We also maintained a high clean product yield at 84% and realized higher margins in our Refining, Marketing and Lubricants businesses. Our Refining realized margin of $12.56 per barrel is the highest since the second quarter of 2007, and our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed has improved to 17%.","Let's turn to Slide 8 and look at the Refining and Marketing adjusted earnings. Adjusted Refining and Marketing earnings of $1.2 billion reflect significant improvements in our Atlantic Basin Europe and Central Corridor regions, as well as U.S. Marketing, Specialties and Other.","In the Atlantic Basin Europe region, earnings increased due to improved margins and lower controllable costs. Margins improved largely as a result of higher market crack spreads, while controllable costs were lower, primarily, because of the absence of operating activities at our Wilhelmshaven and Trainer Refineries.","Earnings in the Gulf coast were fairly flat as improved clean product margins were offset by a less of a feedstock advantage, reflecting the narrowing LLS Maya differentials.","The Central Corridor improved significantly this quarter due to higher margins, reflecting our advantaged feedstock position in this region. The WCS discount to WTI and the increased amount of heavy crude processed at our Wood River Refinery following the completion of the CORE project drove the feedstock advantage this quarter.","The Western Pacific region was lower this quarter as positive secondary product impacts were more than offset by less of a feedstock advantage, along with inventory impacts.","Other Refining benefited from gains associated with Canadian crude imports as we were able to utilize our pipeline transportation capacity to take advantage of favorable WCS to WTI spreads.","Results for this quarter also include foreign exchange gains that are not directly attributable to one of our other regions. From an overall Refining and Marketing perspective, the foreign currency exchange impacts this quarter represented a modest loss.","U.S. Marketing, Specialties and Other improved by $67 million due to higher fuel and Lubricant margins which were partially offset by higher costs. While internationally, earnings in Marketing, Specialties and Other were comparable to the same quarter last year.","The next 2 slides highlight our performance in Refining.","As we turn to Slide 9, adjusted earnings increased $353 million this quarter. Improved margins were the key driver with higher market cracks and secondary product margins being the only offset by less favorable crude differentials. Additionally, lower natural gas prices this quarter resulted in lower utility costs and were a key driver in the lower overall operating costs.","Let's take a look at our market capture on Slide 10. Here, we look at our global market and realized crack spreads. Overall, the market crack was very favorable this quarter. Our realized margin of nearly $13 per barrel indicates that we captured 70% of the market crack this quarter, and we capitalized on these favorable margins by operating at a 93% utilization rate. The market indicator margin in the second quarter was $17.85 per barrel and assumes a 100% clean product yield.","As you can see, our actual clean product yield in the second quarter was 84%, which creates the $3.03 adjustment shown on the slide. The $5.32 reduction from secondary products reflects the fact that the non-clean products we produced attracted a sales price, which on average, was less than the cost of our benchmark crudes.","The feedstock advantage stems from running crudes and other processed inputs that are priced lower than our benchmark crudes. Our feedstock advantage this quarter was primarily related to the Canadian heavy and foreign sour crudes that we processed.","The other category which contributed to our realized crack of $12.56 per barrel for the quarter primarily reflects the impacts from volume expansion. In the appendix, we have also included updated market indicator crack spreads for each of our regions.","So move to Slide 11. In addition to running at a high utilization rate, this slide shows our progress in being able to increase our advantaged crude runs at our refineries while improving our clean product yield to over 84%. Advantaged crudes increased from 47% in 2011 to 52% year-to-date in 2012. This is primarily driven by an increase in Canadian heavy crudes, as well as domestic WTI price links streams, including an increase in the amount of shale crudes that we processed. For example, year-to-date, we've averaged throughput of 120,000 barrels per day of shale crudes.","Many of our refineries have the complexity to run price-advantaged Canadian crudes and we have access to multiple pipeline systems to reliably deliver these crudes to our inland U.S. refineries and this results in a competitive advantage.","Moving to Slide 12. Marketing, Specialties and Other generated adjusted earnings of $334 million, an increase of $84 million from the same quarter last year. The improvement was driven primarily by higher margins across major product lines. On the fuel side, U.S. wholesale margins improved due to a steep decline in spot --  a huge decline in spot-based product costs, which fell more rapidly than posted product prices. Our Lubricants business also generated improved results as product costs stabilized during the quarter, compared with the rapidly rising costs in the second quarter of last year.","The next slide shows our per barrel metrics. Refining and Marketing's income per barrel improved this quarter to $4.37 per barrel while the cash contribution increased to $5.19 per barrel. These results are reflective of R&M running well this quarter and a very strong margin environment.","This completes our review of the Refining and Marketing business or segment. Next, we move to the Midstream segment beginning on Slide 14.","Our Midstream segment was impacted this quarter by reduced equity earnings from DCP Midstream, offset by inventory gains in our other Midstream businesses. However, year-to-date annualized return on capital employed continues in line with last year's performance at 30%. We ended the quarter with $1 billion in capital employed in our Midstream segment. As mentioned earlier, we recorded an after-tax noncash impairment of $170 million related to our equity investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline.","As we move to Slide 15, Midstream's adjusted earnings of $79 million were comprised of $42 million in earnings associated with our interest in DCP and $37 million from our other Midstream businesses.","Slide 16 provides additional variance explanations for both our DCP and our other Midstream earnings. As shown on the top portion of the slide, earnings associated with our interest in DCP decreased by $48 million this quarter, mainly due to DCP's exposure to commodity prices. This was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense attributable to an overall increase in the remaining useful lives of DCP's assets. Volume mix was also favorable this quarter as DCP processed more liquids-rich volumes and a low dry gas. Our other Midstream business improved by $16 million. Inventory related gains primarily contributed to this improvement.","Shifting discussion now to our Chemicals segment, beginning on Slide 17.","Earnings for the Chemicals segment consists of our 50% equity interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, or CPChem. CPChem had another great quarter. It's best quarter ever, with adjusted earnings of $242 million. Strong performance was driven by improved margins along with lower utility costs. Year-to-date, annualized after-tax return on capital employed increased to 30%, up from 28% last year, and we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in capital employed in the Chemicals segment.","The next 2 slides provide more detail on Chemicals' earnings. This quarter, adjusted earnings increased by $52 million compared to the same period last year. The increase in earnings was primarily in Olefins and Polyolefins, partially offset by increased income taxes accrued by Phillips 66 on the equity earnings from CPChem. And this was primarily driven by the mix of foreign and domestic earnings.","Slide 19 provides additional details on CPChem's operating segments. Olefins and Polyolefins generated income of $245 million in the second quarter. The $62 million increase was due primarily to increased ethylene and polyethylene margins and lower utility costs as a result of reduced natural gas prices. Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics earnings increased by $5 million compared to the same period last year, and this was due largely to improved benzene margins.","This concludes our discussion of the financial and operating results for the quarter. Next, I will provide you with some outlook items for the remainder of 2012.","In Refining and Marketing, we expect our global utilization rate to be in the mid 90s and our pre-tax turnaround expense of approximately $145 million over the second half of the year.","In Midstream, the majority of capital expenditures, depreciation and interest will be incurred by DCP. For 2012, we estimate DCP, on 100% basis, will fund the capital program of approximately $2 billion, with depreciation and amortization of $300 million and net interest expense of $170 million.","","In Chemicals, we estimate that CPChem, on a 100% basis, will have capital expenditures and investments of approximately $1 billion in 2012, with depreciation and amortization of roughly $260 million and net interest expense of $10 million to $15 million.  CPChem expects to complete the repayment of its remaining $400 million of senior notes during the third quarter of this year.","Corporate and Other is expected to be at costs of about $125 million per quarter for the remainder of the year, including after-tax interest of about $50 million per quarter.","Guidance for Phillips 66 for 2012 is capital expenditures of $1 billion to $1.5 billion with depreciation and amortization of $900 million. Our corporate tax rate is a function of mix, largely dependent on the amount of U.S. versus international earnings, and we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 35% for all of 2012.  And finally, Phillips 66 does not have any debt maturities coming due in 2012.","We can now turn to Slide 21 and I'll hand the call over to Greg Garland to take you through an update on how we are advancing our strategic initiatives. Greg?","Greg C. Garland","Thanks, Greg. Well, as we execute our strategy, we remain focused on our initiatives to enhance return on capital, deliver profitable growth and grow shareholder distributions. We're also committed to operational excellence and creating a great place to work. We continue to improve our metrics around personal and process safety, and environmental stewardship.  As we said, we plan to reduce costs by eliminating spin-related di-synergies by the end of 2013 and we set a target of $200 million. We're also working hard to create a great place to work for our employees. We value our employees, we want to have a place of mutual respect and collaboration.","We completed the sale of the Trainer Refinery and we'll continue to work to optimize our portfolio. We did make the decision not to sell Alliance. We have a positive view on domestic Gulf Coast crudes to becoming an advantage feedstock, and we think as this plays out, Alliance will create long term value in the portfolio.","Earlier, you saw our crude slate, which demonstrates the progress we've made on getting advantaged crudes into our refineries. We continue to work this hard because every dollar we can save on feedstocks significantly improves our bottom line results. Crude and energy is greater than 70% of our cost structure. It's the single biggest lever we have to improve value.","Some of our initiatives in this area, we've talked about the railcar acquisition, to get 2,000 railcars, but we've also worked agreements to allow us to more efficiently load and unload crudes at both the source sites and the refinery. We're also expanding our own infrastructure. For instance, to bring Mississippi line crude into our Ponca City refinery. And we'll work other deals in other areas to get more advantaged crudes to the front end of our refineries.","Besides crude advantage, we're working to improve access to exports. So far this year, we've increased our capacity to export about 14,000 barrels a day, so we have a current capability of 130,000 barrels per day. We're progressing in about 4 different projects that are expected to increase our export capacity to over 220,000 barrels a day by the end of next year.","We have some key growth projects underway in Midstream and Chemicals. In Midstream, DCP is progressing its NGL logistics and gathering and processing projects. 2 big pipes. One is the Sand Hills Pipeline that run from the Permian, in the Eagle Ford to Mont Belvieu, 720-mile, 20-inch line. Initial capacity of 200,000 barrels a day. We can expand it up to 350,000 barrels a day. The Eagle Ford section is expected to be operational in the third quarter. This is about a $1 billion project.","The Southern Hills pipe really runs from the MidCon to Belvieu. This pipe's targeted capacity over 150,000 barrels a day of NGLs. About $1 billion of investment. Completion expected in mid 2013. Both these pipelines, once in service, will contribute to fee-based margins to DCP.","DCP is working on the Eagle plant in the Eagle Ford. It's a 200 million cubic feet per day gas processing facility. It's expected to be up in the fourth quarter. Also have other gas plants in construction. The LaSalle plant at the DJ Basin, Rawhide plant in the Permian and the National Helium upgrade in the Granite Wash, all scheduled for start up in 2013. In total, we expect DCP will spend between $4 billion and $6 billion in 2012 and 2014.","In Chemicals, CPChem has a 35% ownership interest in Saudi Polymers Company. This project was formed to execute a major petrochemicals project in Saudi Arabia. The facility will produce ethylene, propylene, high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and 1-hexene. Start up activities are in progress with commercial production expected in the near future. This facility will have an annual capacity of 1.2 million metric tons of ethylene and 1.1 million metric tons of high-density polyethylene. In the current environment, we expect this project will increase Chemicals segment's earnings by 10% to 15%.","CPChem is also expanding its fractionation capacity at Sweeny by 22,000 barrels a day, so total capacity will be 138,000 barrels a day. Expect completion of this project in the first quarter of 2013. This is roughly a $100 million investment.","CPChem is starting construction on a 1-hexene plant at Cedar Bayou facility. This plant will utilize CPChem's proprietary 1-hexene technology. Annual capacity of 250,000 tons. It will be the largest of its kind in the world. We expect start up in the first quarter of 2014.","CPChem also continues to progress efforts on its U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project. This project includes a 1.5 million metric ton per year ethylene cracker at the Cedar Bayou facility and a 1 million metric ton per year polyethylene plant, which will be built adjacent to CPChem's Sweeny facility. Polyethylene capacity will consist of 2 plants that would both use CPChem's proprietary technology. This final project's approvals are expected in 2013, start up 2017.","As part of our plans to increase distribution to shareholders, our Board of Directors declared a $0.20 dividend to be paid in the third quarter. We expect to have modest dividend increases in the range of about 5% a year. We want to look back in 10 years and say, we increased the dividend every year at this company.","This morning, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our outstanding common shares. The shares are going to be repurchased from time to time in the open market at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. We plan to hold the shares of stock as treasury shares.","So all in, I think we had a solid quarter. We ran well. We generally had improved margins going for us. I'm proud of the employees. There was an immense amount of work done behind the scenes to get the new company up and running. Our employees didn't take their eye of the ball. They executed well. They turned in excellent results, from operational excellence to very disciplined management of the business in all aspects of the business.","So with that, we'll conclude and we'll open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So, I think a lot of questions are going to be focused on trying to understand the earnings outlook. So maybe just start with 1 small question on Chemicals. You mentioned the 1-hexene plant. Could you give us a sort of an idea what the investments in that plant so we can think about the contribution it might make to cash flow ... ?","Clayton Craig Reasor","But Edward, that's a proprietary technology for us. And we typically have not given out the investment in that. We think it is the best route in the industry to make 1-hexene. We have those facilities up and running in Qatar today. Just starting one up in Saudi Arabia. This will be our third such facility.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just to confirm on the Saudi cracker, you said 10% to 15% uplift to the CPChem overall earnings, is that?","Greg C. Garland","Correct.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. And just on the plans to increase advantaged  crudes. Obviously, we've seen your investment in the railcars, but maybe help us walk through where those crudes might go or in fact, if you think of the different U.S. regions, the types of barrels that you may be able to add into each region, which is advantaged?","Greg C. Garland","Yes. So, kind of year-to-date, we've increased our exposure to the TI-linked crudes obviously. 120,000 barrels a day of shale crudes. We've also increased Canadian heavy by about 33%. We're running about 205,000 barrels a day of Canadian heavy today. About 60,000 barrels a day of Canadian medium light. And then -- about 225,000 barrels a day of other WTI or TS-related crudes. So that's 600,000 barrels a day where I'd say TI-linked crudes. On the heavy, we are running -- the heavy asset, Latin American heavy, about 471,000 barrels a day. So actually, about 50,000 barrels a day reduced in this area. And we've also reduced our exposure to Brent-related crudes by about 165,000 barrels a day all in. So, as we think about where can we move crudes, we want to move the shale crude from 120,000 to ultimately 450,000, 460,000 barrels a day. And we're trying to get those crudes to every refinery we can. But clearly, to Ferndale on the West Coast, Bayway on the East Coast. We think Ferndale can probably run 50,000 barrels a day of Bakken crude. Wood River, we can run up to 90,000 to 120,000 barrels a day of shale-type crudes there. Ponca about 60,000 barrels a day. Bayway, 100,000 barrels a day of shale-type crudes that we can advantage, that we can move into Bayway. Smaller, Rodeo, we can get in 30,000 barrels a day. And Sweeny about 40,000 barrels a day. And then Alliance, we're running today, Eagle Ford crude and some Bakken crude in Alliance. But ultimately, 50,000 to 90,000 barrels a day. So we have a plan to get advantaged crude into most of our refineries, Ed.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And final one on that topic. Most of that is related to rail or are you going to be doing some sort of lower-cost -- I mean, rail is $12, $13 or so, if that's the right number, but some lower-cost numbers are on other forms of transport?","Greg C. Garland","No. Absolutely. So what I mean, we're down to 2,000 cars, that gets us about 120,000 barrels a day of capability. And that can go east or west out of Bakken. There's other areas and other shale plays that we're looking at rail to get to the front end of refineries. We're looking at making investments around P66 infrastructure. For instance, in gathering systems and\/or trucking in the Mississippi Line to get advantaged crude into Ponca, we're looking at connecting to other pieces of pipe that are coming north, south, to get more Canadian heavy into some of our assets. And then around the Eagle Ford, we're looking at pipe solutions around Eagle Ford. So I would say that we're hooking at pipe, rail, truck, barge, just about any way we can get advantaged crude to the front end of the refineries.","Operator","The next question is from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.","Mohit Bhardwaj","Yes. This is actually Mohit Bhardwaj talking on behalf of Faisel Khan. I have a question regarding the CORE project. If you guys look at the WTI, WCS differentials, they move around a lot. I'm just trying to understand what level of heavy-light differential is required to make an investment in a new coker in these market conditions when everybody is trying to build one?","Greg C. Garland","Well, I'm not sure that anyone would start a new coker today in today's market environment. There's more coking capacity then there is heavy capacity to get into the cokers today. And I think we view that through at least 2017. But on the other hand, I would say that we're pleased with our investment that we made in the CORE project. It's delivering the results that we anticipated. We're up to 200,000 barrels a day of Canadian or heavy crude into Wood River. We're seeing the clean product yield improvement that we envisioned. We are net 65,000 barrels a day of clean products to us. So 120,000 across the refinery. So as we step back and look at that project, $3.8 billion investment, solid returns in our view. This is a 15%, 20% type return project for us.","Mohit Bhardwaj","You know the reason why I asked this question was it's been the darkest in years as far as the Gulf Coast is concerned. You have -- you require is a 8% to 9% is the discount that has been said if you want to run a sand coker for heavy-light differentials. I'm just trying to understand what's the number as far as some of these mid-continent cokers that you guys are building, some of the others are trying to build. What level of TI CS differential would be required to justify the economics?","Greg C. Garland","I'm not sure that we've really given the specifics. I guess it would depend upon the size of the coker, where the facility is, what other investment options you have. But I think -- I don't think we can give you a specific number on that one.","Operator","And the next question is from Doug Terreson from ISI.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","My question is on financial strategy and specifically, while equity is growing and some will be removed by the repurchase plan that you announced, you're probably going to have to remove a lot of equity to stay within your stated capitalization range, that is unless debt is reduced as well. So my question is, what is the plan for debt reduction, if there is one, given the low-cost nature of the debt that you took on recently? And how do you try to balance or how do you plan to balance these strategies in coming quarters?","Greg G. Maxwell","Doug, this is Greg Maxwell. I think in response to your question, it's a good question. As a mentioned, we don't have any debt maturities coming due in 2012. In the near term, we've got the 3-year term loan that starts coming due in 2013 on out about $570 million due in the first quarter of next year. The balancing aspect of it is, as you know, debt is cheap right now, and so we have to balance that with the other pieces of our capital programs as far as distributions, dividends, as well as capital expenditures. And currently, we have, as we mentioned, no intention or a stated intention to pay off any debt in 2012 and we -- the current plan is to meet the obligation that we have in March of the first piece of the 3-year term loan.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'd like to echo the appreciation for the disclosure that you gave. We appreciate that. I had 3 questions that are pretty quick to ask. They maybe long to answer. The first was, given your organic project queue and buyback, I assume that means that acquisitions are less important to you. You haven't really said anything about that. I just wondered if you could kind of make a statement for our benefit. The second was, can you just explain to us, to the best extent you can, what the impact of low NGL prices is on your business? And the final one was, you have a controllable cost target, which, off the top of my head, I seem to recall is, $4 billion of controllable costs for 5% with the target for around $200 million of savings. You did mention the controllable cost improvement you had during the quarter, but I wondered if you could just update us on the target?","Greg C. Garland","Okay, Paul. Great. I'll take them one by one. In terms of the project cues, we kind of said we expect that the P66 capital will be between $1 billion to $1.5 million. We certainly have some infrastructure investments that we'd like to make around getting the advantaged crudes to the front end of the refineries, to export infrastructure products out into attractive export markets. We've booked at what's out there on the market right now in acquisitions, and there's nothing really interesting to us at this time. So we've got our plate full in terms of executing the plan around improving our base R&M business. Improving margins, returns. As you know, we have a significant organic growth going on in our Midstream business at DCP and in our Chemicals business at CPChem. I mean, we're very comfortable with that profile of spend in both of those businesses. In terms of low NGL prices, in some ways, we balance across DCP and CPChem, and we tend to pick up margin across that value chain. But just in terms of the Midstream business itself, about $0.01 per gallon change in NGL price is about $4 million in net income for us.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The last one was controllable costs?","Greg C. Garland","Yes. Controllable costs, we've put a number out there, $200 million. We think it's a good number.  I frankly think we'll do better than that. We tend to always exceed. We've got a program we call the Optimize 66 that we're working across this budgeting process which we're in the middle of it now. And people are looking at all avenues to improve efficiency and reduce cost. And frankly, the boys have come up with some great ideas from their early work that I've seen. So I think that the $200 million is a good number for a target.","Operator","And the next question is from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have a number of questions, hopefully that they are all short in terms of your answer. Greg,","do you have any low-cost, cheap capacity expansion opportunities in your Central Corridor in the Gulf Coast systems?","Greg G. Maxwell","So you're talking about Refining capacity?","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes.","Greg G. Maxwell","I don't think so. I think the investment that we're looking in the Central Corridor in the Gulf Coast is really right in infrastructure around the refineries, rather than expanding the refineries.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. I know that you are not looking at expanding, I'm just wondering if there are opportunity for low-cost expansion at all?","Greg G. Maxwell","Yes. There maybe things on the back end of turnarounds, just normal de-bottlenecking that would occur in refineries. Maybe around Wood River, as we get more experience in the CORE project. But I'm not aware of any capacity additions that are coming in the Central Corridor or Gulf Coast.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And Greg, since that you guys have been talking about the focus, at least for the next couple of years, on the investment, if not the infrastructure. Does it make sense, from that standpoint, that to launch a MLP for the -- put some of your Refining, related logistics also into that and then use that as a vehicle to invest, given that they have a much better funding cost than Refining in general?","Greg C. Garland","Well, thanks for being the first person to ask the MLP question. So, what we said publicly and we'll continue to say is that, in the Analyst Meeting in December, we're going to shed more light on where we're going with the MLP. As you know, we have an MLP embedded within DCP. I think we understand the potential for value creation that MLP will bring and certainly, I think DCP is using MLP very effectively to raise equity to fund their growth program. So similarly, as we're thinking about a Phillips 66 MLP, we'd look to say can we add value through raising infrastructure. So we'll tell you more about that in December, but we're working that hard, we're thoughtfully considering how do we use an MLP to the best advantage of Phillips 66.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But at the minimum, Greg, based on your answer that we should assume that you guys are not resistant to the idea that this could be a value creation ...","Greg C. Garland","Oh, no, no, no. We're not resistant ...","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","[indiscernible] good vehicle [ph] that to host those growth projects that you may be talking about?","Greg C. Garland","No, we're not resistant at all. I think we have an MLP embedded within DCP. We like it. We think it's been a very efficient way of raising equity and will continue to be a good vehicle for DCP. And we're just thinking about what's the best way for Phillips 66 to work in this space.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can I have the number of the balance sheet item that what is your inventory market value in excess of both your short-term debt or up the entire total debt? And also your working capital, as well as do you have any goodwill and intangible asset on your balance sheet?","Greg C. Garland","Okay, so let me run through those real quick again for Greg Maxwell so he can catch up. So the first one was [indiscernible] inventory relative to book?","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. In excess of the book.","Greg G. Maxwell","Yes, we've got a $5.5 billion of inventory on the books. I will get that additional number for you as we go through the answers. It's in the back of our Q and I'll get that for you. But I think it's in the neighborhood of $5 billion. The second question ...","Greg C. Garland","That one I think was short term debt relative to ...","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Short-term debt.","Greg G. Maxwell","Short term debt. What you'll see, Paul, on our short-term debt is really only the maturity of what we have coming due, as I mentioned earlier on the first tranche of the term loan. $590 million.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And do you have any goodwill on your intangible asset on the book?","Greg G. Maxwell","Yes, we have a pretty good chunk of goodwill on our books. We have about $3.3 billion of goodwill associated with the previous acquisitions. And then intangibles of just about $700 million.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And what is your working capital?","Greg G. Maxwell","The working capital in total, if you look at our current assets, we have $18.5  billion -- this is all the end of second quarter, $18.5 billion of current assets of which $3.1 billion is cash. So looking at that, we have $15.4 billion of current assets and about $14.4 billion of current liabilities. That gives us a net overall working capital of about $1 billion.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Perfect. 2 final quick questions. One, the share buyback, Greg, I know this would be subject to your management's discretion. Any kind of target date? How quickly that you want to complete that?","Greg C. Garland","It's an open-ended program and we're not going to disclose an end point target. But you know, as we typically don't sit on our hands, I think you should expect to see us in the market every day, but not necessarily the same amount every day.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure. A final one, on dividend. I understand that...","Greg C. Garland","And Paul, we'll report the amount of shares that we buy or the number of shares that we buy and the amount that we've used on a quarterly basis.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Perfect. On the final one, on dividend. I understand the desire, that you raise your dividend every year. But I don't know whether you gentlemen agree, but to place [ph] somewhat a loan only account [ph] that historically, looking at Refining as a just a trading group, and I think management has a great opportunity to change that perception if we boost the pay out to at least into the 3.5% to 4%. And then even at that is like 150 per share and given your earning power, it seems like you still have plenty of room that you grow over time. So I don't know if that's something that may be under consideration or that you just wanted that to go slow --","Greg C. Garland","So Paul, I read your report. I thought it was thoughtful and well done. And I think we appreciate your advice and counsel in that subject. I think that what I would like to say about dividends are, I think they're the centerpiece, they're just fundamental to our philosophy around shareholder returns and distributions. We want to pay a competitive dividend. We want to increase that dividend over time. We recognize this is a volatile business. There's going to be some years where you feel flushed with cash and some years when you don't feel as good about cash flow in the business. You'll see us protect and the defend that dividend at pretty much all cost. It's so important to us. We do want to increase it. And you'll see us use share repurchases and specials also, as we think about returning cash to shareholders. So we'll look at that total toolbox that we have in terms of dividends, increasing the dividend, share repurchases and specials in terms of returning cash to shareholders.","Greg G. Maxwell","Paul, this is Greg Maxwell. I was a little light on the number for the excess of current replacement cost over LIFO. At the end of the second quarter, it was 6.9. Sorry about that.","Operator","And the next question is from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","I had a question on your decision to retain Alliance. Obviously, in this market, there's a lot more sellers of assets than there are buyers. I was hoping maybe you could give us some kind of indication of the interest that you saw on the asset and how much of your decision was a result of maybe a lack of interest or your actual shift in strategy on Gulf Coast crude?","Greg C. Garland","I would say it's actually a combination of both. We had a lot of people go through the data room. We had a handful of offers and another one, we really regarded, as approaching our hold value for the asset. We made the decision to put the asset on the market, it really has integrated ConocoPhillips. We kind of had 1 view of where LLS was or where it was going. I think in the interim year that's passed since we made that first decision, that our view has changed in terms of Gulf Coast crudes, particularly LLS, becoming an advantage. So you think Alliance really has more future value than -- and certainly, value today than what people are willing to pay.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Greg, is it fair to say that Alliance is one of the key contributors to the increased export capability over the next year or so?","Greg C. Garland","So we are exporting out of Alliance and looking to increase the export out of Alliance. It's a nice refinery. Single train refinery built in '77. It's a good, solid refinery. It's just a light sweet refinery on the Gulf Coast of the U.S. And so I think that as our thinking has evolved around LLS and around exporting, we see more value in Alliance.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. The second question I had for you was on the ethane cracker on the Gulf Coast. I see you're looking for FID in '13. I'm just trying to understand the process. The permitting component of that, do you need to have that in hand before you can move to FID? And if so, can you just tell us where you are in that process?","Greg C. Garland","Yes. So the credits we need have been acquired. Permits have been applied for. And I mean, just part of our process, we won't take FID without having the permits. And so, I think that's probably the factor that gets us there. We're in the process of -- we have a 2-step process where we do about 20% to 30% of the engineering up front. So we're just starting that, really, that first phase of engineering. But we fully expect that we'll be ready for FID in 2013.","Operator","And the next question is from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","On refining rationalization, there was something you talked about through the spin and now you've got Trainer done, and Alliance you've talked about retaining. So is effectively, the rationalization complete on the Refining side?","Greg C. Garland","Well, I think you'll see us continue to work the portfolio. I think we're like any company, we have a range of assets within our portfolio in terms of the returns and the future expected values of the assets. So you'll see us continue to work that. If you think about the assets around the periphery that could be non-core to us in the markets. But certainly, if you think around the Central Corridor assets, we really like those assets, we think they're long-term value-creating assets. Our Gulf Coast assets, same. And so we're not going to name specific assets today on the call. But I would say that we do have fixed our asset plans around some of our assets that are -- and you can see the numbers that we released today. Particularly, for example, the West Coast-challenged environment today, go back 2005, great earnings, great returns. But clearly, with the California crude decline, with the demand decline in California and the high operating costs that we see in California, really a challenged environment. And so we're working to put advantaged crudes to the front of those refineries and look at our cost structure and how to improve our cost structure to improve those assets.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Very good. Slipping to crude on the U.S. Gulf Coast, particularly with Alliance. How much light crude are you importing into the Gulf Coast? I'm just trying to get an idea of what the opportunity is to shift from international sweets to domestic sweets?","Greg C. Garland","I'm not sure I've got that one. That's something that I can get, Jeff. But we run a little bit of sweet at Sweeny. So I think we've got a crude in there of 50 a day or so that West Africa or North Sea. I don't know if they're running Eagle Ford now. I think we have moved some Eagle Ford into Sweeny and moved -- but I think we're still importing at Sweeny. I think Alliance was primarily HLS and LLS. So, I don't think we were importing a whole lot into Alliance. Lake Charles, I think that was a heavy -- that's a heavy medium-sour refinery, but I can get those numbers for you. I don't think it's a big number. I don't know what our in parts are. We'll have to look at the waterborne barrels.","Greg G. Maxwell","We can get it for you.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","We'll follow up on that. And Greg, maybe just a quick update on what petrochemical demand and margins look like going into 3Q?","Greg G. Maxwell","Petrochemical demands.","Greg C. Garland","We can talk about 2Q. We are kind of hesitant to give a forecast, I think. If we think about CPChem, their volumes were relatively flat to slightly up, margins improved second quarter over first quarter. But there's a lot of turnaround activity during the kind of first half of the year, so we expect there's going to be some pressure on ethylene margins going into the back half of the year. So we think globally, we're concerned about Europe, we're concerned about China slowing down. And so I think that could have an impact on the global petrochemical business.","Operator","And the next question is from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My thanks as well to your accountants, especially for the appendix slides, your 25 to 28, that's very appreciated that you included that margin detail.","Greg C. Garland","We're here to serve.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That\u2019s nice. You mentioned you're keeping Alliance. Just a follow-up on that, can you quantify at all, order of magnitude, what types of discounts you're now looking at for, presumably LLS to Brent, that made you want to keep this?","Greg C. Garland","Oh, I think it's $2 to $3 is what our expectations are going to be, longer term.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. So it's gone up from what would have been $1 or $2 to coupled $3-type discount?","Greg C. Garland","Absolutely.  It may take 1 year or 2 to get there.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. That's great. And when we think about restructuring the portfolio, you mentioned the ability to get the shale to places like Bayway and Ferndale. We would've probably, at least at one point, had them on the list as kind of restructuring or potential asset sale candidates. I presume the decision to keep or not keep those very much hinges on, can you land that shale crude at enough of a discount to Brent or ANS as the case may be, and if you can, they're much more likely to remain part of the portfolio?","Greg C. Garland","Absolutely.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. That's great. Just lastly, in terms of the -- it looks like 24% of your products slate that's heavy or non-light sweet crude. How much flexibility do you have if you wanted to run all light-sweet instead of that heavy, if the discounts are wide enough? Could you run all of that at light-sweet or would some of that have to always be heavy or is that [ph] a crude?","Greg C. Garland","Well I think we could run a lot more light-sweet if we're willing to take rate reductions. And we're running those models every day, and so, we're going to chase value versus volume. And if the models tell us that we can make more money running less crude, we will do that.","Greg G. Maxwell","But they're really configured. As you know, you get constraint at the light ends handling on the facilities and so that's what the issue is.","Greg C. Garland","We've looked at that. It seems like the numbers are -- it's like a 25% reduction in throughput to go all the way -- as far as we can, yes.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","There must be some ability to do one for one and then it falls off, I'd assume?","Greg G. Maxwell","I think that's right. Obviously, there's a blending that you can do as well as. I think that's the approach we're taking right now.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. And I'm sorry, one last one. You're calling WTI, WTS Canadian. Is that Canadian syncrude or is there heavy crude in that Canadian portion? This is Slide 11.","Greg C. Garland","So, yes. We've got all the WTI WTS kind of lumped together, and so.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But what you're calling Canadian, is that light sweet Canadian or is there WCS and heavy Canadian in that Canadian or is that all in the heavy acidic mix?","Greg C. Garland","I think that's all in the WTI. So what we've got in that 29% or 28% is we got about 100,000 of shale, we've got about 205,000 of Canadian heavy, 60,000 of Canadian medium light and then 225,000 of TI TS.","Greg G. Maxwell","Yes. The heavy and acid is Latin American, there's no Canadian in that.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So some of the Canadian heavy's are in that Canadian number.","Operator","And the next question is from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'll make it unanimous, as we approach the hour, that I appreciate the additional disclosure. Yes, my first question is a, maybe a follow-up to Paul's question earlier. And maybe I missed the answer, but I know you guys are very focused on cash returns. You're focused on growth in Midstream and Chemicals, but I mean, are Refining acquisitions off the table or as a similarly situated peer looked it's on its way to maximize the value uplift in an MLP structure, I mean, are those types of transactions not in your forward plans?","Greg G. Maxwell","Yes. There's just nothing out there that interests us right now. In terms of acquisition in the R&M space.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And in Midstream?","Greg C. Garland","Well, things are -- I don't think we would say we would not be interested in a Midstream acquisition, but I think with the valuations that we're looking at the Midstream assets right now, prices are...","Greg G. Maxwell","They look high to us. Both Chemicals and Midstream looks high on the valuations to us right now.","Greg C. Garland","So I wouldn't expect any significant M&A type deal in the near term from us. And we've said that increasing refining capacity for us is probably not in the cards. So, an acquisition of a refinery wouldn't be consistent with what we've said in the past.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. Second question. On the refined product export capacity that you're -- are you guys currently at that max rate? I think you mentioned is 130,000 barrels a day or effectively limited in any way in exports. Or are these expansion more to allow for profitable exit when new Gulf capacity, particularly distillate streams in 2013 or Gulf Coast utilizations ramp in a Brent [indiscernible] differential opening up?","Greg C. Garland","So we ran about 90 a day in the second quarter, which is -- it was actually down from the first quarter. But they have some turnaround activity that really impacted that. And so, our plan is to ramp exports up somewhere around 220. But we're going to chase value. So if [indiscernible] is there, we're going to take it, if not, we'll start where we can get the highest value.","Greg G. Maxwell","It's really around creating optionality for us at us at those facilities. So when the markets are better, we can participate in them.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's great. And on the railcar order, can you discuss maybe kind of cash costs or Bakken differentials you'll need to move feedstock into Bayway and whether or not there's any other transloading capacity that needs to be built out there? And are you railing anything, but currently I thought there was some volumetrics that were moving in there?","Greg C. Garland","Yes, we're doing some currently today. Yes, but we have 10,000 railcars today already, but there's probably just a couple of hundred, I would guess, in crude service right now for advantaged crudes. And that's the reason we went ahead and made the order for another 2,000 cars. So, we are negotiating with other third parties to improve access for loading and unloading. We're looking at doing some of our own infrastructure for loading and unloading, so it's kind of an all above. And yes, we're running in Bayway today, a couple -- I don't know, 10,000 or 20,000 barrels a day, I think, in Bayway today. So, the answer is yes, we like that we're trying to get as much in as we can. We're looking at all the infrastructure. Preferably, if we can get a third-party deal with someone else, that's great, if not, we'll build it ourselves.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And maybe one last one, if I could. I know you guys clearly benefit on the NGL feedstock side in Chemicals. It was lower pricing and were ex impairment. Does it change, in any way, the way you look at NGL infrastructure such as Sand Hills or Southern Hills lines projects?","Greg C. Garland","I mean, those are both fee-based, for the most part, projects. We think they're good solid return projects. We're not going to slow down on those. To me, the governor is going to be on the E&P side and the development, is crude going to be $60 or is it going to be $100. And I think that will ultimately will set the pace for all this $80 billion worth of industry investment in infrastructure. But as we kind of look out, we're kind of $90 to $100 guys, so I think, in terms of our view of where crude prices go longer-term, and so, we think that there's going to be value in pursuing these infrastructure projects.","Operator","And the next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Again, I'd like to echo all the additional disclosures. It's much appreciated. Thanks for that.","Greg C. Garland","Thanks, Doug.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of things. I think some of these have been touched in different questions but I wanted to get a little bit more granular on the portfolio. I mean, you still obviously have -- if of you look at the earnings mix, that clearly, things have been moving increasingly towards the U.S. That's going to be the dominant part of your business going forward. How do you feel therefore about how assets in Malaysia, I guess, Ireland -- I'm leaving Humber out, because we all know that's a phenomenal facility. But, some of these other peripheral facilities, are those a permanent part of the portfolio as given the strategic advantage the U.S. has right now over the rest of the world?","Greg C. Garland","So, I would say in the integrated ConocoPhillips, that, that asset was a strategic asset. I think if you think about Phillips 66, it's a not strategic asset for us.","Greg G. Maxwell","You're talking about Melaka.","Greg C. Garland","Melaka, yes.","Greg G. Maxwell","And Whitegate, of course, is challenged. From the standpoint, it's a light-sweet crude refinery that's fairly simple and European refining is under pressure, so. I guess we look at things from a couple of different angles. One is from the returns. So what are the returns at the facility compared to the rest of the portfolio and compared to what our targets are? Can it generate mid-teens returns? And then secondly, would be free cash flow generation. So what does that refinery do in terms of a discounted free cash after CapEx? And is it a source of capital or can we monetize it and redeploy that capital in another part of the portfolio. But those are, I would say, will be the 2 key criteria that we would use on whether or not the assets would remain in our portfolio.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","What would you expect to -- I mean, is that something that's going on as an active review or just something that's not a priority right now?","Greg C. Garland","I know, at least as part of the company that we were spun out of, we were very specific on the size of our asset disposition program and pretty public on how much we were going to sell when. I don't think we're going to take that same approach in terms of how we manage the portfolio, in terms of being as transparent on how much we're going to sell in any given year. But we have $50 billion of assets. And so, we need to be looking at our portfolio all the time and looking at the bottom 5% or 10% saying to ourselves, okay, is this worth more to somebody else or does it belong as part of our portfolio? So, you should expect us to continue to work that portfolio even if we're not saying something publicly.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. Terrific. And then a couple of quick follow ups if I may. The CORE project, I'm just curious, obviously, the whole thing is designed around, I guess, Canadian disadvantaged crude. But with the dynamics changing the way they have done, are you currently running heavy crude through the CORE project or are you basically -- I'm just trying to get an idea as to what the marginal economics looks like right now heavy versus light. I understand there's a yield loss or a utilization loss, but it would seem to us that the light sweet has the advantage right now?","Greg C. Garland","We like the numbers around the Canadian heavy right now or almost any Canadian crude, as you think about it. So, yes. We're running Canadian heavy today.","Greg G. Maxwell","Yes, I don't -- are you looking at like LLS to Maya being compressed or because actually the [indiscernible].","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, I'm just trying to get an idea. I mean, obviously I bet there was huge drop off at the beginning of the quarter. But as we look forward, there's a lot -- it seems to be a lot of pipeline infrastructure coming on stream towards the back end of this year and early next year. I'm just curious of which -- what the LP would basically determine would be the better way to go. But I guess another way of asking the question is are you open to running light-sweet to [ph] cost even though the obviously, the investment was geared towards the heavy?","Greg G. Maxwell","Absolutely, of course. I mean to the extent that we'll back out other TI type barrels to run a cheaper Bakken barrel, we would do that. But quite [ph] I think we're pleased with the performance of the CORE project to date . It came up. It's run well. It's been profitable. It's done the advertised improvement in clean product yields, in capacity expansion. It's hitting on all of its metrics and so, we're pleased with that.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Last one for me. Just the big move in crude prices during the quarter. I'm just curious is there any kind of derivative or timing difference issues that helped your margins? And I'll leave it at that.","Greg C. Garland","I think it helped marketing, right? I think as crude prices or product prices fall sharply, it creates short-term margin expansion. But I don't think, in terms of inventory or trading gains, we saw a significant impact from the decline in crude price.","Operator","And the last question will be from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just really kind of quick questions, maybe more on the operational front. As you look at your performance in the Mid-Con here, what you call the Central Corridor, how much of that was strictly the market and how much of that is maybe some of the changes you were able to make transportation wise, in terms of a little more permanence or at least a little bit of dislocation relative to just market indicators?","Greg C. Garland","I would think that a big part of it was the market. Part of it was improved around running more heavy at Wood River. We just talked about in clean product yield around that. We did get some more advantaged -- other advantaged crudes into the Mid-Con refineries. But if I had to guess, it's probably 80%, 85% market and 15% other improvements.","Greg C. Garland","During this second quarter, we really didn't have much turnaround activity in the central. The second quarter turnarounds were really on the coastal refineries. I guess we had 1 refinery that was down. But turnaround activity was relatively light as well. That may have helped.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the only other question I had more on the financial side. The share repurchase, you said you're going to hold the shares as part of the treasury stock. What's the thought on that? Is that for future compensation and acquisitions? I mean, as opposed to retiring them, what's the thought process there?","Greg G. Maxwell","Roger, this is Greg Maxwell. Initially, the share repurchase program at $1 billion is about 4% over the time and since we're not starting out with really any treasury shares, the view, current view, is that we would hold those initially as treasury shares, and then we'll look at our options going forward. But as you hit on it, as you go forward, you could have some use for those. And so, that's just an opportunity for us to continue to hold those at least in the interim period.","Operator","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Clayton Reasor for closing remarks.","Clayton Craig Reasor","Okay, great. Well thanks Sandra. I think it was a great initial quarter conference call. Obviously, we feel good about the results. You can find a copy of our presentation material and the sensitivity data on our website. Transcript will be there as well. And if you have follow-up questions, feel free to give us a call. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

The presentation material we will be using during the call can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information.","Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg Garland for opening remarks.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $569 million, or $1.09 per share. We delivered good operating performance and generated strong cash flow during the quarter.","Utilization increased to 98% in Refining and in CPChem's Olefins and Polyolefins. This represented our second-highest quarter in Refining and the highest utilization CPChem has achieved in the last 10 years. In addition, during the quarter, several of our facilities were recognized at the Annual AFPM Safety Awards.","Out of approximately 275 refining and petchem facilities eligible for recognition, 11 total U.S. refineries were recognized for their strong safety performance. Of those 11 refineries, 6 were Phillips 66 facilities. And our Lake Charles Refinery, received the 2016 Distinguished Safety Award, the highest industry recognition. Lake Charles has gone two years and over 11 million hours without a reportable.","We're really proud of the people of Phillips 66 through their hard work and dedication, they're demonstrating our commitment to operating excellence and that we can achieve a zero accident workplace, that every employee and contractor can go home safe to their families every day.","Cash from operations for the quarter was $1.9 billion, the highest since 2013 and includes the impact of discretionary distributions from CPChem and DCP. We continue to maintain our commitment to shareholder distributions. During the second quarter, we raised our dividend by 11% and increased share repurchases by nearly $100 million to $380 million for the quarter. In our first five years as a company, we've increased the dividend at a 30% compound annual growth rate and repurchased or exchanged 131 million shares, representing more than 20% of our initial shares outstanding.","During the quarter, we made significant progress on several growth initiatives, breaching major milestones in key projects in Midstream, Chemicals and Refining. In Midstream, commercial operation started on the Bakken Pipeline. The pipeline moves crude from the Bakken field in North Dakota to delivery points in Patoka, Illinois and Nederland, Texas. Phillips 66 has a 25% interest in this joint venture. The Bakken pipeline feeds our Beaumont Terminal, which we continue to expand. This quarter we added 1.2 million barrels of product storage and we're building over 2 million barrels of additional crude storage. As crude and product exports grow, Beaumont's well positioned to generate additional earnings.","We're currently evaluating opportunities to build additional NGL fractionation capacity on the Gulf Coast. We plan to approve the project once commercial arrangements for NGL supply are finalized. Phillips 66 Partners remains an important part of our Midstream growth strategy. PSXP's run rate EBITDA has increased to $675 million, and the partnership's on track to reach its goal of $1.1 billion in run rate EBITDA by the end of 2018. In addition to drop-downs at the partnership, PSXP is pursuing a number of organic growth initiatives, including expansion of the Sand Hills and STACK JV pipelines. We expect construction to start this quarter on the second leg of the Bayou Bridge crude pipeline, which will extend the pipeline to St. James, Louisiana.","In addition to the Sand Hills expansion, DCP Midstream is expanding its DJ Basin footprint with the construction of the Mewbourn 3 gas processing plant, which should be completed by the end of 2018. DCP has also announced plans to participate in a joint venture natural gas pipeline out of the Permian.","In Chemicals, CPChem achieved a major milestone on the U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals process by reaching mechanical completion on the polyethylene units. Commissioning activities are progressing and the two units should be fully operational later this quarter. Ethane cracker is scheduled for mechanical completion in the fourth quarter of this year.","In marketing, we continue to enhance our network by reimaging sites domestically and growing the number of sites in Europe. To date, we have reimaged over 1,000 sites. Gasoline volumes at the reimaged sites are improved by 3% year-over-year. In Refining, the Billings Refinery completed a capital project in June which increases heavy crude processing capability to 100%. The project was completed safely, on time and on budget.","At the Bayway and Wood River refineries, we're modernizing FCC units, increase clean product yield. Both projects are expected to complete in the first half of 2018.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to go through the financial results.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Thank you, Greg. Good morning. Starting with an overview on slide 4, second quarter earnings were $550 million. We had two special items that netted to a loss of $19 million. We recognized a $34 million net charge for pension settlement expense. This was partially offset by an insurance claim reimbursement. After removing these items, adjusted earnings were $569 million or $1.09 per share.","Cash from operations for the quarter was $1.9 billion. This includes a positive working capital impact. Capital spending for the quarter was $458 million, with $271 million spent on growth projects. Distributions to shareholders in the second quarter totaled $741 million, including $360 million in dividends and $381 million in share repurchases.","We finished the quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 25%. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 32%. Annualized adjusted year-to-date return on capital employed was 6% through the second quarter.","Slide 5 compares second quarter and first quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings increased by $275 million, driven by improvements in Refining and Marketing and Specialties.","Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. Transportation adjusted net income for the quarter was $74 million, down $4 million from the prior quarter, mainly due to seasonally-higher maintenance spend. In NGL, we had adjusted net income of $14 million. The $3 million decrease was driven by seasonally-lower propane sales and higher turnaround impact at equity owned fractionators, partially offset by improved results at the Sweeny Hub.","DCP Midstream had adjusted net income of $13 million in the second quarter. This represented a $4 million decrease from the first quarter, reflecting the impact of lower commodity prices and higher integrity spend. This was partially offset by a gain on an asset sale. After removing non-controlling interests of $37 million, Midstream's second quarter adjusted earnings were $64 million, $13 million lower than the first quarter.","Turning to Chemicals on slide 7, second quarter adjusted earnings for the segment were $196 million, $5 million lower than the first quarter. In Olefins and Polyolefins, adjusted earnings increased by $18 million, primarily due to improved margins and higher volumes. Global O&P utilization was 98%, an improvement of 9 percentage points over the prior quarter. Adjusted earnings for SA&S decreased by $24 million due to the absence of the first quarter gain on CPChem's sale of its K-Resin business, as well as lower equity earnings. The reduction in equity earnings was driven by lower margins and unplanned downtime.","In Refining, crude utilization was 98% for the quarter, 14 percentage points higher than the first quarter. Pre-tax turnaround costs were $154 million, down from almost $300 million in the first quarter. Clean product yield was 85%. Realized margin was $8.44 per barrel, down slightly from last quarter. The chart on slide 8 provides a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings. In total, the Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $233 million, a $235 million improvement from last quarter. This increase was driven by significant improvements in the Atlantic Basin and West Coast regions, partially offset by decreases in the Gulf Coast and Central Corridor.","Adjusted earnings in the Atlantic Basin were $159 million higher than last quarter. This increase was driven by improved market cracks, lower turnaround costs and higher utilization. Market cracks improved by nearly 40% during the second quarter and capacity utilization increased from 70% to 103% as the Bayway Refinery completed a major turnaround during the previous quarter.","These increases were partially offset by lower clean product differentials as European cracks lagged PADD I cracks. In the West Coast, adjusted earnings improved $120 million over the previous quarter. This increase was primarily due to a higher gasoline crack and the positive impact on volumes and costs of completing a major turnaround at the Ferndale Refinery during the first quarter. The Gulf Coast saw lower adjusted earnings despite higher utilization and lower turnaround expenses, as these improvements were more than offset by lower margins driven by reduced feedstock advantage and lower clean product differentials.","In the Central Corridor, adjusted earnings decreased by $33 million from the prior quarter, in large part due to the cost and volume impacts of the second quarter turnaround at the Billings Refinery and reduced feedstock advantage on Canadian crudes. The Billings turnaround was completed in June.","Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the quarter was $14.06 per barrel compared to $12.24 in the first quarter. Our realized margin for the second quarter was $8.44 per barrel resulting in an overall market capture of 60%, down from 70% in the prior quarter. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries. During the second quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate then premised in the 3:2:1 market crack.","Losses from secondary products of $2.44 per barrel were slightly lower than the previous quarter due to falling crude costs and higher coke prices. Feedstock advantage improved realized margins by $0.63 per barrel, $0.95 per barrel less than the first quarter as light medium and light heavy crude differentials tightened during the second quarter.","The Other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. This category reduced realized margins by $1.30 per barrel compared with $0.67 per barrel in the prior quarter, mainly due to lower clean product differentials.","Let's move to Marketing and Specialties on slide 10. Adjusted earnings for M&S in the second quarter were $218 million, $77 million higher than the first quarter. In Marketing and Other, the $61 million increase in adjusted earnings was largely due to higher margins and volumes. Specialties adjusted earnings increased by $16 million primarily due to improved base oil margins.","On slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted after-tax net costs of $142 million this quarter compared to $123 million in the first quarter. The increase in net costs reflect lower capitalized interest due to project startups as well as certain tax adjustments.","Slide 12 shows the change in cash during the second quarter. We entered the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations was $1.2 billion. Working capital changes increased cash flow by about $700 million and include the benefit of returning to normal operations following the high turnaround activity in the first quarter. We funded approximately $500 million of capital expenditures and investments and distributed over $700 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 512 million shares outstanding and our cash balance was $2.2 billion.","This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In the third quarter, in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and before tax turnaround expenses to be between $50 million and $80 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $125 million and $140 million after-tax.","With that, we'll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, there. Good morning, good afternoon. First question just on the capital spending, obviously, you're trending quite well. Greg, I didn't hear anything about a reduction in the full year capital budget. I think last year at this time you did give a reduction because you were trending pretty well. So just what are your latest thoughts on CapEx for the full year?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Well, first of all, I don't think you take the first six months and double it to get an annual number but I would say we're going through our midyear capital review now and I think in the last month or so we're going to give you some guidance around that. The question for us is really FID on the fracs and when do we take those. But I think we're at that point in the year, even if we do FID on in the third quarter, we're not to spend a lot of capital this year. It'll probably be an 2018 to 2019 lift for us on those. So I think you're going to see we're going to guide down in terms of capital by several hundred million dollars.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And how would you put that in the context of the longer-term outlook for capital spending, kind of the framework that you've laid out in the past?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yeah, I still think the framework of $1 billion-ish of sustaining capital, $1 billion to $2 billion of growth capital is still, we think, of appropriate level for us going forward.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it okay. And then just the second question, in light of the commentary on Midstream and there's several moving pieces here on the NGL side of things but where are we on the $300 million to $500 million total EBITDA from the frac and the LPG export? Obviously there are some other factors here in the quarter as well but how would you frame that up and when do you think we can hit that full run rate?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes, so I'll take a quick stab at it and then Taylor can come over in the top and correct me, maybe, if I get it wrong. So, the frac, we've seen a lot of ethane rejection. We've seen heavier feeds going into the frac and we struggled to hit design rates on the frac. We have done some debottlenecking around the C4s (17:26), which is where our limits were. And so in the second quarter we actually ran the frac at rate 100,000 a day for the first time since we started it up. So I think we've got that issue solved in terms of frac. So it's generating kind of that $60 million to $70 million of EBITDA that we laid out originally.","On the export facility, I think there's some market structure issues that we need to just think through in terms of being able to deliver on the promises that we made there. We're currently doing the 8 cargoes a month, although in the second quarter I think we did 20.5 cargoes; we're 3.5 cargoes short. But we're in that seasonal part of the year, where you see those declines. And I would say as we're moving into August, we're more than fully loaded coming into August, so I think we see good results there.","As you know, dock utilization across the industry is in the low-80s, and I think we're going to have seen that utilization move up to the 90s before we can actually get the fees up. And so, where we'd premise kind of a $0.12 to $0.14 fees, they're running $0.07 to $0.08. And so, I think, all-in, where we're at right now, we're probably somewhere around $200 million to $250 million-ish of EBITDA in that facility against the $400 million to $500 million that we had promised though.","Now and I think as we come into the back half of 2018, we see NGLs coming at us. There's been new fracs announced. We're obviously working on two new fracs, and so I think that we're going to see the NGL supply, particularly propane increase. I think you're going to see it's going to be necessary to export those propane volumes out of the U.S. to clear them. And so, I do think that utilization starts to improve as we move in the back half of 2018 and 2019. And then, I think that's when you see the opportunity for those fees to increase. And I'll turn it over to Tim, and he can add some color on that.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yes. I think that really the issue is that as you think about it NGL price relative to crude has strengthened, particularly with propane. And so I think as supply increases, you see that coming back into balance. And then, it would structurally be helpful to have a high crude price, and that has an impact as well as you think about substitution economics in the various markets, whether it'd be for heating, or for petchem.","So I think you'd like to see crude market strengthening, increased NGL supply in the U.S. That brings the utilization up and gives a chance to really open those arbs up. And until you see that and we think that happens out this next 2018 months or so. Until you see that, you really, I think, kind of see where we are. So we work hard on optimization, reducing our costs, and making improvements that we've done in terms of run rates, operating cost and the values that we get for the products. So make good progress on that, but the real breakthrough has to depend on that market improving.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Okay.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, everyone. Greg, I may have misheard you, but did you say that the Gulf facility is going to be mechanically complete later this year, because I saw a press release from you guys \u2013 well, at least from CPChem saying that it was already mechanically complete?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","So, yes. The polyethylene is mechanically complete, and I think we're really close putting hydrocarbon in to those units. So they'll be up and running this quarter. The cracker is going to be mechanically complete until the end of the year, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. I got it. And so, we would expect a contribution financially next year pretty early on?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I think the big \u2013 yes. The big contribution will be in 2018, but we'll get some contribution off the polyethylene units in the back half of this year.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes. Got it. Can you talk about the next phase there? And, by the way, while you're on the subject, would you mind just looking back at the original decision to build this thing and how the market has changed both from your own point of view and also the competitive environment down there? Thanks.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Well, maybe I'll start backwards. I think that we still think it's a good decision to build the facility. It's really made possible by the shale revolution in the U.S., and we still think that North America and the Middle East are the two best places to make petrochemicals. And so, there's nothing that fundamentally around that view has changed.","A lot of other people have jumped in and are building capacity, so no question there's a lot of capacity that's coming up in this kind of 2017 and 2018 timeframe, but we're still constructive on the market view. I think that this market's still growing at 1.5 times GDP. As we look around the world, if anything the economies are doing better than we kind of expected. We're seeing good results in Europe. Asia continues to be strong. We're seeing good economic results in the U.S.","And so, I think we feel good around the fundamentals, and we're not as concerned about the supply-and-demand balances out in 2018 and 2019 as some people are. I think that you're going to see some compression on margins as these crackers do come up. But, fundamentally, I think that you kind of need four or five crackers a year just to keep up with demand. And so, I think we'll certainly push through that relatively quickly.","I don't know Tim, if you want to add any color on that?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yes. I'd just think back on \u2013 reflect back a bit. I think we've anticipated that margins would come in, but they're still quite good today in the order but in that near $0.30 a pound, which still provides incentive and reinvestment economics. And I think as you look out, you still see the supply of ethane in the U.S. increasing and you're seeing already additional announcements.","So I think from an industry standpoint, this still looks like a very competitive place in North America to build. The world's appetite's there, and as Greg said, I think the markets have continued to be strong, and as you think about the supply side for a couple of years, I think we've got little \u2013 a flatter spot here on utilization in the next 18 months. After that it begins to tighten up again. So I think it's still a pretty constructive market situation and we still like investing here in North America and then in the Middle East as well. But we continue to look at options around the world.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","So the first part of the question was around what are we doing on the second project. So you want to give an update on that?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yes. So we're actually in the engineering phases of site and technology, looking at ways to be more capital efficient, and still thinking that in the U.S. it's likely to be the next site for that. But really an FID on that cracker, we'd see sometime after next year, sometime post 2018. But still advancing down that because we still see the need for growth. We're still leveraging the CPChem's technologies, and we still think it's going to be a very attractive market.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you. You answered the question. Thank you.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody, good morning, everybody. I've got one housekeeping one and one strategic one if I may. Kevin, the housekeeping one is deferred tax. Can you help us a little bit with how you see that trending? Because it continues to be a fairly substantial piece of the cash flow year-to-date, I think it's now overtaken the full year's deferred tax from last year at this point. And I've got a follow up, please.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yes, it is. And you will have noticed that it was higher in the first quarter than the second quarter. So we would expect to continue to see some deferred tax benefit in our cash flow and the primary driver there is the impact of tax depreciation versus financial. So we have the benefit of bonus depreciation on new assets that is significantly higher than financial depreciation. And so you see that affect flow through the cash flow statement on deferred tax. The first quarter was a bit of an anomaly because of the item that for earnings was a special item, the consolidation of the MSLP and the gain on that triggered a sizable deferred tax impact there.","So I would kind of ignore some of the big jump in the first quarter on that. But over the course of the year, we're still going to see a reasonable deferred tax benefit for the full year, and it will be more than what we saw last year, as you've already pointed out.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I appreciate the guidance on that. So my follow-up is really more about the drop-down schedule for PSXP, and obviously we're halfway through the year, and I'm guessing we're anticipating something in the second half. So I'm wondering if you could speak to how you see the timing of the next wave of drop downs to get to your $1.1 billion EBITDA target. And more specifically and, Greg, maybe this is for you. The corporate bond that you did at the end of last year had some unique attributes to it, and I'm wondering how that might feature into the likely funding of a PSXP drop-down as it relates to the parent level total debt? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Okay. Well, let me start at the high level, and then I'll let Tim and Kevin kind of weigh in. We still think that 20% to 30% debt-to-cap on a consolidated basis at PSX is the right target for us. There was some unique characteristics about how we structured the refinancing of the debt that we did earlier this year, with the intent that we could make that drop debt essentially droppable into PSX as we dropped assets.","And Kevin can go through a little bit more of the details. You know we don't guide in terms of timing of drops. Clearly, we're at $675 million, we said we're going to be at $1.1 billion run rate by the end of 2018, and people can do the math around that, and come up with their ideas. I do think we'll have a drop in 2017 and also in 2018, or maybe multiple ones. But I still think that we have a path to get to the $1.1 billion and we're very comfortable with that path. So, Kevin, do you want to talk a little bit about the debt, how we structured that?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yes. I will, Doug, and you're referring to the $1.5 billion of PSX bonds that matured actually in the second quarter. It was May 1 maturity, we refinanced those in April to take care of that. They were refinanced with short-term floating rate notes and term loans that are assignable to PSXP. And so what that means, we can, as part of a drop transaction, move debt down with the drop as part of that funding and then PSXP would have the flexibility to go out into the market and term out over a longer period of time that debt financing.","So that in and of itself means that component of the payment, if you like, for that drop would not generate cash at the PSX level but it's also consistent with how we've talked about PSX level debt dropping as the MLP debt increases. The MLP structure, obviously it's a leveraged structure, and it will increase debt as it grows. And so to manage consolidated debt, this is one way of accomplishing that, that we're effectively moving debt down from the parent level into the MLP.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Kevin, thanks for the color. I know it's kind of complicated issue. But just a quick point of clarification still, if you're moving debt off the balance sheet at PSX to nonrecourse at PSXP, obviously, you're not getting the cash in the door from the debt they may otherwise have raised. So how does this impact the buyback schedule as opposed to debt reduction as a relative priority producer (29:21)?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yeah, so a couple of things. It is still consolidated debt on the PSX balance sheet. So on the PSX financial statements, that debt is still there, okay? So it does. It reduces the net incoming cash to the overall corporation, because all we've done is move debt between entities. But when we step back and look at the cash that's generated from the business, from the equity markets, and it's not that PSXP won't be doing any debt financing of its own incremental to what's coming from PSX. So we still think \u2013 we look across, holistically across all of that and it still works in terms of being able to fund the capital program, fund the dividend, fund the share buybacks.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Really helpful.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","We don't have to drop the debt, right?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","That's true, that's true.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, fair point. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate the answers.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Your next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, team.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Hi. Good morning.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I thought we'd start off on the Specialties and Marketing business. Relative to our model, that was the standout area in the quarter. So love for you guys to talk about what was the driver of relative strength in the business. And then on Specialties, in particular, anything that you would call out of whether the strength was sustainable or not?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yes, Neil. This is Tim. On the Specialties business, it's really the improvement in our lubes business. And we talked about improved base oil margins. We also did \u2013 you know, Lake Charles was in turnaround the first quarter which is where the base oil unit is. And so this is much more of what we would've expected versus the prior quarter.","So I think it continues to be a business for us that one where we continue to see fairly stable earnings. And so I look at the second quarter and that's something that we would expect to continue more at that level versus the first quarter, so good improvement as a result of that.","On the other side, on the Marketing side, it's really strong results in our European Marketing. It's strong results in our U.S. Marketing and it just reflects from the standpoint the spread between the rack and the wholesale margin expanded in that market environment and it fluctuates but, generally, that's been a pretty strong performer. And so I think a pretty consistent cash flow on the marketing side and EBITDA in those businesses. And we've been, I think, pleased with the strength that we've seen, both in Europe and the U.S., in terms of that spread between the rack and the wholesale margin.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate the comments. The follow up is it's around the health of the product markets. And I'd appreciate your guys' views in terms of what you're seeing in your outlook in terms of your views on distillate and gasoline and the outlook going into the back half of this year.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","In the gasoline market, I think it's relatively flat in the U.S. We look at same-site sales. We look at reimage sites. We're seeing strengths in various regions across the U.S. being a little bit different, but it still feels to us like this year will be a lot like last year in terms of total demand.","The real upside is coming from the U.S. perspective with the export side. The short that we've seen in Latin America, particularly in Mexico, with some of the things we've had there, both in the Gulf Coast and the West Coast have actually improved that. Europe, as Greg mentioned earlier, is doing better as well and Asia continues to be on a global basis there. So I think we're encouraged on the demand side but it's not over the top growth but it's still been fairly good growth if you just step back and look at the global side.","And the distillate cracker has actually improved versus last year. And I think what we're seeing is a little more industrial activity around the world's helping to support that. In the U.S. perspective, we've been able to export and there's just been support this year on that distillate crack and with strong distillate jet sales, et cetera, that have improved the overall crack in the market. So unlike 2016, I think that's helped balance the proportion of distillate to gasoline and has improved the overall profitability in the segment as a result. But still not what I'd call a supply-constrained market. And so I think that we see seasonal strength coming through the third quarter and then some tail off in the fourth and first quarter.","Jeff Dietert - Phillips 66","If you look broadly at manufacturing PMI U.S. level for May was the highest since 2014. Germany PMI has really spiked. China year-to-date is the highest since 2012. So manufacturing activity, the indicators we're seeing more broadly are supportive of distillate demand.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Are you seeing that translate into your U.S. Marketing business as well, Jeff? And any comments in terms of what you're actually seeing on the wholesale side?","Jeff Dietert - Phillips 66","I would say on the distillate side, we continue to see very much what we see. We think about the more retail-oriented piece of that. We see very much what we see with gasoline, kind of volatile up-and-down but not strong increases. Some increase with oilfield and some of those activities coming back and \u2013 in transportation movements, largely offset probably by efficiencies, even in the diesel market. And so I think that it's related more to infrastructure additional activity around the world in that in the construction side. But I would say the distillate and gasoline markets look fairly similar in terms of just fundamental demand in the U.S. in terms of year-on-year growth, with jet being probably the one exception where it's really been a strong market around the world.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Hi, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Kevin. Kevin, what is the cash distribution from CPC and DCP this quarter?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yes. Paul, so we don't disclose the specific distributions. But I can tell you that \u2013 so $422 million of total distributions this quarter. If you look back over the last previous five quarters or so, the average distributions were $150 million per quarter, $422 million this quarter. The increase is essentially is explained by what's coming out of those two and the bulk of it is CPChem. So we did receive distribution from DCP but it's small compared to CPChem. And I'd also say it's still not ratable, so we probably had disproportionately more in the second quarter than you'd expect to see on a normal quarterly basis. Maybe not so much so if you look at the second quarter, if you think about that as a first half, then more in line with what you'd expect to see annualizing a half year number.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Actually, Kevin, I mean, with the CPC expansion, the spending has pretty much come to end. I'm actually surprised that you didn't expect the distribution going to be higher from the CPC than what we've seen in the first half.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","And it will be as you look forward into next year, especially. So you have two effects going on. The capital spend is coming down. So this year's CapEx at the CPChem level is about $500 million, $600 million lower than the previous year, lower than 2016. And then as you look ahead to 2018, you'd drop off by a similar amount in capital expenditure. And by 2018, you'll see some \u2013 you'll see the operating cash flow from the new assets as well. So you will as you look forward see that cash ramping up.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And the next one is for \u2013 I think for Tim and Greg. Some of your competitors that have decided to move into Mexico on the logistic and maybe bidding on some of the physical assets to \u2013 as an extension of their export strategy. Just wondering that is that a business that you guys would be interested or that you view it differently.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Paul, this is Tim. We've had a long-established relationship in Mexico so it's been a trade partner with us. So we continue to access that market and I think you have to look at the infrastructure and say is that something that you need to serve that? So it's something you can think about for consideration. I think the second part of the question though is about what do you think about exports?","And we continue to expand at Beaumont. We continue to look at ways to access additional exports out of our Gulf Coast refineries. And so that's something that we think about in terms of a Midstream and Refining investment that may be a way to leverage and really take care of a, so to speak, the demand side that we're seeing from the international side. So we have projects underway to look at dock expansions, those kinds of things, to increase access to all those markets, not just the Mexico market.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. So, Tim, I guess my question is that so that sounds like that you're not in the camp that you necessarily need to own the physical asset in Mexico in order to expand your export capability or that you're walling into that country. (39:06)","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","I think we'll evaluate those but I think right now we've been comfortable that with our existing relationships that we've been able to serve that market quite well. So it really depends if the market structure changed then I think we'd have to think about that but right now we're comfortable with where we are.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And a final one, if we look back the Sweeny NGL Hub as you mentioned earlier that right now it's probably running maybe about 60% to 50% of the EBITDA is what you originally expect. Just curious that from a look back standpoint, does it in any shape or form, that have changed the way how you evaluate project and FID the process going forward or do you believe that this is somewhat unique by itself and also it's just a temporary event. So it doesn't really change the way how you look at project going into the future.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes, I think for better or worse we kind of live in a commodity world, Paul, and we're used to both kind of volumes and margins fluctuating on us and we really can't call the timing that well. We do think about the trends and long-term and we're always talking about the mid-cycle and thinking about the mid-cycle case. And I do think that we'll have the opportunity to grow margins in that business. Certainly, the volumes are there and as we look at what's coming at us out of the Permian over the next couple years and out of U.S. shale, I do think that that we'll have the opportunity to improve the earnings in that asset.","But we FIDed it in a $100 crude world and we're in a $50 crude world today, so that is a big difference. In retrospect, we might've moved sooner and faster maybe to tie up some of these longer-term contracts. And so I think that's a learning for us on that one, Paul, but I do think that we're still very comfortable taking commodity risk as at the PSX level.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Hey, Blake.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Hey. The cash flow was really strong and I know you addressed a couple of the drivers but one was working capital and it looks like you unwound about half of the hit that you witnessed in 1Q. So I'm just curious if you have any thoughts on how that could change here in the back end of the year?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yes, Blake. It's Kevin. That's right. It is about half of the hit we took in the first quarter. Remember the first quarter you had the impact of pretty sizable inventory build and also we were hit on payables, especially with all the turnaround activities that you effectively run down the payables balance. And so we've got the payables component back to kind of more normal levels and then the rest is just normal kind of ins and outs.","So we had a slight benefit on receivables with the falling price. We had a slight reduction in inventory and so you kind of get back to that $600 million, $700 million working capital improvement. I don't think as you look ahead to the third quarter, absent there'll be fluctuations based on prices and all of that but I wouldn't anticipate anything significant in the context of the third quarter. And then as you go into the fourth quarter, you'd typically have the inventory drawdown and then it's just a question of how much of that flows through to cash versus carries forward as receivable.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Got it. Okay. And then that kind of leads me to my second question, which is on the buybacks. Obviously, there was a pretty healthy step-up step change from where we had been trending the previous several quarters, and I guess I'm just trying to figure out is that a function of the improvement in working capital, just a one-off quarter, where we have additional cash, or are you guys trying to strategically kind of change the profile of the distributions?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","No, I think we're still at the highest level, kind of at the 60\/40 split we've always talked about, Blake. I think that a couple of things. One is we pull capital down a lot. 2016, we pulled share purchase down in 2016 just given the fact that we generated half the cash that we generated in 2015. There's always questions around where the margins were going to go in 2017, and then the share price took a dip, and we just bought more shares as the share price dipped. But we've guided to $1 billion to $2 billion of share repurchase in 2017. I think I've also said that we don't intend to be at the bottom of the range this year, if that helps.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Yes. Thank you.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Hey, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess maybe come back to some of the Midstream, specifically in my case DCP, that has continued to struggle, and I'm just kind of wondering you've put a lot of effort into you and your partners fixing it, restructuring it and all, and still the results are a little bit on the soft side. So I'm just wondering what's the thought process there. Is it improvement in margins? Or is there additional sort of internal restructuring we should be waiting for?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I think that we did the major restructuring early this year where, essentially, what we get now out of DCP is the LP and GP distributions. There's some level of holdback at the GP level that can happen depending on cash needs at DCP today, but you really kind of need to think about the distributions that we're going to see out of DP is really going to be related to our LP and GP ownership, which is about 38% today at the LLC level.","The good news is with the restructuring, we're getting distributions out of DCP, which is new. And then, you think about DCP, I think in a kind of a mid-$50, let's say, NGL-price environment, I think they'll be able to cover their distributions. So, I think that \u2013 I don't know if DCP is completely fixed, if you want to put it that way, but I do think we've made a lot of great progress in terms of the cost structure, the contract-portfolio work that's been done, and then just the fact that NGLs are kind of trading up in that mid-$50 range has been very constructive for DCP. And so, as we move forward and we think about NGLs going forward, I think we're still pretty constructive on the NGL prices going forward, particularly as that thing starts to come out in rejection.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yes, Roger. It's Tim. So, hey, as ethane comes out, the volumes come up. And if you look at DCP, some of the opportunity they're seeing is in the DJ Basin, the Permian particularly with Sand Hills, the debottleneck, and so the volumes have been increasing there. So I think that you need a stronger environment where we're seeing in the crude, gas, and NGL markets would help that. But then, beyond that, it's just continuing to increase that fee-based business, and that's where they've really put their emphasis, and they're looking at expanding their G&P footprint, as well as their pipeline connections to do that. So I think it takes some time, but at the current market rates they're in a pretty good position with the backstop on the GP IDRs to help that transition period.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, to completely change gears here, on the Refining side, light-heavy diffs have been narrowing. You seem to come through 2Q without too much trouble on that. I was just wondering as you look at Q3 and then, obviously, some risk on Venezuelan barrels one way or the other, how you're looking at the light-heavy? Have you switched aggressively to a light barrel? What is your flexibility from this point forward? Kind of what other measures would you take at this point?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I think in the second quarter, we ran about 6% less heavy crude, 3% more medium, 3% more light. I think our view is that just given all of the operational issues in Canada, what's going on with the crude cuts in the Middle East, and troubles in Venezuela, I think you're going to see light-heavy diffs kind of pressured into the third quarter. I think as we come in the back half of the year, you see some of operational issues maybe solved, Mildred Lake and different places. You get into refining turnaround season, and the fall turnaround season, you might see those diffs open up a little bit more. But I would expect coming into the third quarter, they're going to be pretty narrow.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from Justin Jenkins with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I guess I'll start with a dovetail on Roger's question there, and get one light crude differentials. It seems like Brent versus WTI has been reasonable, and Permian has shown a few signs of life in terms of discounts. Is there a potential that we see PSXP maybe look to get an even bigger presence with upstream customers to maybe gain better control of those barrels or at least maybe the quality of the barrel?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yes, Justin, this is Tim Taylor. So I think PSXP continues to look at the Permian and the areas of SCOOP STACK. You've seen that JV. We're expanding that, we're extending the reach. That's a very attractive barrel for instance, in our Ponca City Refining System, plus it has trading opportunities around the Cushing hub. So I think we all continue to look at ways to tap into that increasing light supply. I do think though that the Brent\/TI differential just ends up being kind of stays narrow because of the opportunity to export now.","So it's also letting us at PSX expand at Beaumont as we've seen a demand for movement across the dock as well as storage there. So I think as this continues to develop, there are opportunities in the Midstream to capture that liquids inflow, but I don't think that you're going to see light differentials between Brent and WTI really come out, unless we get truly infrastructure constrained. And that doesn't look like it's going to happen in the very near term. It would take a substantial increase in the Permian or some other play to really drive that. And we'll see if that goes, but I think now with exports, you really limit that opportunity for a quick blow-out.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I think our view is that infrastructure seems to be keeping up at this point in time.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, sounds about right. And then I guess staying in Midstream, it seems like the capital program there has also trended a bit below the 2017 budget. Is it something that's back end loaded I guess maybe it's one of the potential fracs maybe being in PSXP?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Well, I think most of our growth capital is in Midstream, and so I think as we give the guidance here in the next month or so, that's where you're going to see most of the cut. And you're right, it's a lot around the timing of the fracs and the uptake of the fracs in terms of actual versus what we had budgeted.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","We've also seen about a quarter slippage in Bayou Bridge, which was our joint venture with Energy Transfer and Sunoco eastbound out of Lake Charles over to St. James. And so that's affected the spending and the timing a little bit. But I think that in the Midstream, we just carefully evaluate the opportunity is still growing, Beaumont and some of the options around our basic skeleton. But I think that you've got to see those commitments on the producer side, and I think they've grown a bit more cautious on that.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question is from Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Good afternoon.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. I want to clarify, on the distributions from CPChem as the project \u2013 the ethane cracker has reached its completion. Is there some debt that has to be paid down at the joint venture? Or should we expect that distributions sort of wrap up as the profitability takes off?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yeah, Faisel. It's Kevin. There is debt at CPChem that matures in 2018. And so one of the questions that the owners need to answer is, do we use the cash flow to pay off that debt as it comes due or do we refinance and turn some of that out which would obviously enable more cash for distribution. So that's something that we'll work through with our other owners around that. So, that can be a factor. But nonetheless, even with pay down of debt, we would still assume an uptick incrementally higher distributions in 2018 compared to 2017.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Got you. And then separately, the Jones Act tankers that you guys contracted for a few years ago, when are those contracts are up and do you see yourself coming back into the market to continue to move crude, I guess, from the Gulf Coast up to the Eastern Sea board or has that opportunity sort of evaporated?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","No. I think there's still Jones Act demand on the product in the crude side. And so we have various phases on commitments on that. So we just look at that every time those commitments come up, does that make sense in that term. But it's not as tight as it was a couple of years ago. And so I think we leave that more as an optimization as those leases come up. But we have a \u2013 I think I'd say we have a comfortable position with our exposure on Jones Act.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for fitting me in. Do you see an enhanced vertical integration with a potential FID of a second Sweeny frac later this year and helping to ultimately widen out and stabilize LPG terminal margins?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Okay. So I think I if I interpret your question, A, I think the next increment of investment is more cost effective. And as you increase the production of propane in your own internal fracs, there is an uplift as well. So the incremental decision has more traction. That said, we still need to make sure it makes sense in the context of the total term. But it would be an improvement with the already sunk investment in pipes, caverns and the LPG dock that help drive higher utilization across that system.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Well, that's a good point. The second frac is definitely going to be more economic and cheaper to build. And you all also foreshadowed that you might be lowering 2017 growth CapEx. Kind of as a segue, if recharging Midstream growth CapEx takes longer than expected, can you see share buybacks continuing to trend up possibly above $2 billion? Or would you be looking to possibly build cash over time in an environment with fewer initial growth opportunities?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Well, so I'll take a stab at that. At a higher level, I still think we're comfortable with $1 billion to $2 billion of growth capital longer-term and $1 billion to $2 billion of share buybacks longer-term. So I think you could tweak that in any given year, given where you see your investable opportunities, where you see cash going on. And certainly, we did that in 2016. But long-term, we're committed to investing in the business. Our investments have to hit our hurdle rates obviously. And then in terms of the share repurchase, as long as we're trading below intrinsic value, we're going to buy our shares. And so we think it makes sense in today's environment so we're buying today.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Spiro Dounis with UBS Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to start off with \u2013 and I guess the concept of moving maybe more product into PADD I from PADD II. Obviously some news out there about pipeline reversals. And just given your unique position I guess on both sides of that, can you view something like that as viable, or even makes sense over the longer term?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Well, this is Tim Taylor. So today, the Gulf Coast, for instance, the Colonial arb is still closed. And so I think just anything that connects these markets makes them more efficient, PADD II is different than PADD III. And it may make sense from a PADD II perspective that excess material can go \u2013 so to speak \u2013 can go into the PADD I. So I think that has to rest on its own merits of what you believe those long-term diffs would be and where the product placement on utilization could be. So I can't speak to the merits of that directly because it's not a project we're looking at. But if you think about balances, it may be a way to balance PADD II length with that. And then you either adjust Colonial or imports or some other type of supply into PADD I, which is still an import region in the U.S.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So it sounds like flows would still be pretty seasonable. So if there was a pipeline reversal, it's not like it's going to be utilized all year round, it sounds like?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","It really just depends on the value of imports versus where you are on supply out of the U.S. system. So it could very well be structural as well as seasonal.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. I appreciate that. Second quick one here, just on refining configuration. Seems like it took a bit of a larger hit this quarter on it. So just curious maybe what was driving that. And more broadly, if you'd comment either for you or your peers if you're skewing a little bit more towards gasoline or distillate these days.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Spiro, it's Kevin. Specifically on our \u2013 that variance on capture driven by configuration. If you look at the market crack the way we calculate our global market crack, the entire improvement in market crack was gasoline and the distillate crack was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. And so that will drive a larger impact to that configuration component of the reconciliation from market than to realized.","Jeff Dietert - Phillips 66","Yes, we made about 45% gasoline and 38% distillate in the second quarter.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then just in terms of where you're running these days either max gasoline or distillate, how you're thinking about that?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","I think that this is the peak driving season. So you're definitely skewered toward more gasoline on supply side but unlike last year, there's still support for that distillate. So I would say that you've got to just optimize around each and every refinery and their configuration but this is the peak season. So you do tilt more toward gasoline. As you get to winter, you're going to tilt more toward the distillate.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes, and we're pretty close to max gasoline right now.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Appreciate the color. Thanks, everyone.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have now reached the time limit available for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeff Dietert - Phillips 66","Thanks, Julie, and thank all of you for your interest in Phillips 66.

My name is Julie, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.","Jeff Dietert","Good morning, and welcome to the Phillips 66 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Participants on today's call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Mitchell, Executive Vice President and CFO.","The presentation material we will be using during the call can be found on our Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 Web site along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide two contains our Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our Q&A session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg Garland for opening remarks.","Greg Garland","Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $548 million, or $1.70 per share. We ended the year with a strong quarter, and our operating performance was at record levels.","Refining ran at 100% capacity utilization, and we continue to operate safely and reliably. Our Midstream business significantly grew Phillips 66 Partners by completing a $2.4 billion dropdown; our largest transaction to date. And in Chemicals, CPChem is nearing completion of its U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project.","Our fourth quarter cash from operations was $1.9 billion, our highest quarter since 2013. For the year, operating cash flow was $3.6 billion. We continue our commitment to shareholder distributions. This quarter, we returned 816 million through dividends and share repurchases. This brings our total distribution since inception to $16.4 billion.","During the quarter, we made progress on several of our key projects. In Midstream, we operated well at our Sweeny Hub in a challenging market environment. We averaged nine cargos a month at the export facility, and the fractionator operated 101% utilization. We completed expansion of the Beaumont Terminal's export capacity to 600,000 barrels per day. Today, the terminal has over 11 million barrels of crude and product storage capacity. An additional 3.5 million barrels of fully-contracted crude storage is under construction, and that will take the total capacity to 14.6 million barrels by the end of the year.","We announced an open season with Enbridge with Gray Oak pipeline project to transport crude oil from Permian Basin to markets along the Texas Gulf Coast. The pipeline is expected to have initial throughput capacity of 385,000 barrels per day, and will be placed in service during the second half of 2019. The Bayou Bridge pipeline, in which PSXP holds a 40% interest, has received all permits for the extension from Lake Charles to St. James, Louisiana. Construction is underway. Commercial operations are expected to begin in the second half of 2018.","Existing segment of the line from our Beaumont Terminal to Lake Charles is operating well, is providing crude optionality to our refinery. DCP Sand Hills pipeline, which transports NGL from the Permian Basin to the Texas Gulf Coast has exceeded 3000 barrels per day of throughput in the fourth quarter, and is expected to complete the capacity expansion to 365,000 barrels a day by the end of the quarter. Further capacity expansion of the line to 450,000 barrels a day is anticipated in the second half of 2018. Sand Hills is on two-thirds by DCP and one-third by Phillips 66 Partners.","DCP continues to progress construction of two gas processing plants in a high growth DJ basin. The Mewbourn 3 plant is expected to start up in the third quarter of 2018 and the O'Conner 2 plant is scheduled for completion in mid 2019.","DCP also announced the final investment decision to proceed with joint development of the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline project, in which it holds a 25% interest. The pipeline will provide an outlet for natural gas production in the Permian Basin to markets along the Texas Gulf Coast.","In Chemicals, CPChem is commissioning its new Cedar Bayou ethane cracker, which will start up this quarter and ramp up the full commercial production in the second quarter. At Old Ocean, CPChem has successfully transitioned the two polyethylene units' commercial operations.","In Refining, we continue to focus on high return quick pay up projects. We have multiple yield-enhancing projects that are expected to deliver additional 25,000 barrels a day of clean products by the end of 2018. This includes the diesel recovery project which we completed at our Ponca City Refinery in the fourth quarter.","In addition, we are modernizing FCC units at both our Bayway and Wood River Refineries with anticipated completion during the second quarter of 2018. We also have projects [indiscernible] such as the Lake Charles Refinery, where we are completing modifications to run more domestic crew.","Our 2018 capital budget is $2.3 billion, including $1.4 billion of growth capital and $900 million of sustaining capital. Our portion of capital spend by CPChem, DCP, and WRB is expected to be about $900 million. As we move into 2018, our strategy for long-term value creation remains unchanged. This includes capturing growth opportunities in our midstream and our chemicals business, where we see long-term demand growth and enhancing returns in refining and marketing. Also fundamental to our strategy, our shareholder distributions consisting of a comparative, secure, and growing dividend complemented with share repurchases. We believe the share repurchases are important part of shareholder value creation, and as long as we trade below intrinsic value, we are buyers of our shares.","So with that, I will turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Mitchell","Thank you, Greg. Good morning. Starting with an overview on slide four, our fourth quarter earnings were $3.2 billion. We had special items that netted to a gain of $2.7 billion mainly due to the U.S. tax reform legislation. This benefit primarily reflects the revaluation of our net U.S. federal deferred tax liability position from 35% to a 21% tax rate, and is partially offset by the repatriation transition facts on foreign sourced earnings. After excluding special items, adjusted earnings were $548 million or $1.7 per share.","Cash from operations for the quarter was $1.9 billion, which includes a positive working capital impact of $913 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $537 million with $234 million spend on growth projects. Distributions to shareholders in the fourth quarter consisted of $353 million in dividends and $463 million in share repurchases.","Slide five compares fourth quarter and third quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings decreased by $310 million, driven by lower results in Refining, Marketing, and Chemicals, partially offset by improvements in Midstream. New this quarter, our segment reporting is on a net income basis, instead of net income attributable to Phillips 66, as previously presented. Our segment earnings now include earnings that are attributable to non-controlling interests. This segment reporting change better aligns with how we manage the business and makes our reporting more comparable with our peers.","Slide six shows our Midstream results. Transportation adjusted net income for the quarter was $108 million, up $10 million from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher terminal and pipeline volumes. In NGL and other, the $20 million increase from the prior quarter was largely due to the PSXP acquisition of Merey Sweeny. DCP Midstream had adjusted net income of $14 million in the fourth quarter. A $13 million increase from the previous quarter was due to the absence of third quarter asset impairments, higher NGL prices, and increased volumes.","Turning to Chemicals on slide seven, fourth quarter adjusted net income for the segment was $121 million, $32 million lower than the third quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, adjusted net income decreased by $42 million. This decrease was due to lower sales volumes and higher depreciation and operating costs, partially offset by improved margins. The increased depreciation and operating costs reflect the start up of the new polyethylene units at Old Ocean.","Global O&P utilization was 79%, reflecting continued downtime at Cedar Bayou. The Cedar Bayou facilities hurricane-related repairs continued into the fourth quarter with most major units returning to service by December. Adjusted net income for SA&S increased by $12 million due to higher margins and lower operating costs.","In Refining, our crude utilization was 100% for the quarter, up from 98% in the third quarter. Pre-tax turnaround costs were $99 million, $56 million higher than the third quarter. Clean product yield was 87%, an increase of two percentage points from the prior quarter, primarily due to processing more intermediate term inventory and increased butane [indiscernible].","Realized margin was $8.98 per barrel, down from $10.49 per barrel last quarter. The chart on slide eight provides a regional view of the change in adjusted net income. In total, the Refining segment had adjusted net income of $358 million, a decrease of $190 million from last quarter. This decrease was driven by a 35% decline in gasoline market cracks and higher turnaround costs, partially offset by improved clean product differentials and increased volumes.","Adjusted net income in the Atlantic Basin was $120 million, down $52 million from the third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the lower gasoline market crack, partially offset increased volumes and improved clean product differentials as European cracks improved relative to the New York Harbor crack. The Atlantic Basin region ran at 104% utilization in the fourth quarter; the third consecutive quarter at or above full capacity.","The Gulf Coast adjusted net income was $72 million, down $5 million from the third quarter. The decrease was due to the lower market crack, which was largely offset by higher clean product realizations and increased volumes. The Gulf Coast capacity utilization was 102%, up from 93% in the third quarter. Adjusted net income in the Central Corridor was $192 million, down $6 million from the previous quarter. The decrease was primarily due to turnaround activity at the Ponca City Refinery. New West Coast adjusted net income decreased $127 million from the previous quarter, reflecting the 32% decline in the market crack.","Slide nine covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the quarter was $13.98 per barrel, compared to $18.19 per barrel in the third quarter. Our realized margin for the fourth quarter was $8.98 per barrel resulting in an overall market capture of 64%, up from 58% in the third quarter. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries. During the fourth quarter, we made less gasoline and more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. And the distillate crack was stronger relative to the gasoline crack. As a result, the configuration loss of a $1.44 per barrel was an improvement with $1.58 per barrel from the prior quarter.","Losses from secondary products of a $1.99 per barrel were lower than the previous quarter due to improved NGL prices relative to crude. Feedstock advantage improved realized margins by $0.82 per barrel. This was $0.20 better than the prior quarter. The other category mainly includes costs associated with rents, outgoing freight, product differentials, and inventory impacts. This category reduced realized margins by $2.39 per barrel, compared with $3.20 per barrel in the prior quarter. The improvement was primarily due to clean product price differentials.","Let's move to marketing and specialties on slide 10. Adjusted fourth quarter net income was $124 million; $87 million lower than the third quarter. In marketing and other, the $76 million decrease in adjusted net income was largely due to lower realized margins and seasonally lower branded volumes. During the fourth quarter, we exported 236,000 barrels per day of refined products with continued strong demand from Latin America. Specialties adjusted net income was $37 million, a decrease of $11 million from the prior quarter, mainly due to lower base oil and finished lubricant margins.","On slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted net costs of $140 million this quarter compared to $127 million in the prior quarter. The $13 million increase in net costs was primarily due to positive tax adjustments in the third quarter.","On slide 12, we summarized our financial results for the year. 2017 adjusted earnings were $2.3 billion, or $4.38 per share. At the end of the fourth quarter, our net debt to capital ratio is 20%. The adjusted return on capital employed for 2017 was 8%.","Slide 13 shows the change in cash during the year. We entered the year with $2.7 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Cash from operations was $3.6 billion with minimal working capital impact, and PSXP raised $1.2 billion in equity proceeds. We funded $1.8 billion of capital expenditures and investments, and distributed $3 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. The $400 million in other includes affiliate loan repayments. We ended the year with 502 million shares outstanding, and our cash balance was $3.1 billion.","This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next I'll cover a few outlook items. In the first quarter, in Chemicals, we anticipate the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid 90s. In Refining, the first quarter will be a heavy turnaround quarter for us. We expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid 80s and pre-tax turnaround expenses to be between $230 million and $260 million. We anticipate corporate and other costs to come in between $160 million and $180 million after-tax during the first quarter.","For 2018, we plan full-year turnaround expenses to be between $520 million and $570 million pre-tax. We expect corporate and other costs to come in between $640 million and $680 million. Our after tax corporate costs are higher due to the lower U.S. tax rate as well as the inclusion of interest expense associated with non-controlling interests. We anticipate full year D&A of $1.4 billion. And companywide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the low to mid 20% range.","Our effective income tax rate reflects the impact of the new U.S. Federal rate, state and foreign tax rates, and the impact of income attributable to non-controlling interests. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act should be positive for Phillips 66. We will benefit from the 21% corporate tax rate and the capital cost recovery provisions. We also have more flexibility in managing our global cash balances.","With that, we'll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Greg Garland","Good morning, Neil.","Neil Mehta","Good morning, guys. A couple of questions here, the first is just around share repurchases. With tax reform coming in and the amount of cash flow, you guys should be able to draw as you go into this harvesting mode with lower capital spending. You should be in a position to be aggressive around share repurchases, especially if you do believe the stock is trading below intrinsic value. You have come out with this $1 billion to $2 billion range in the past, Greg and team, just want to see how you are thinking about the potential to even go over that in this type of environment?","Greg Garland","Neil, first of all, good morning, good to hear from you. There is a couple of things that I think about. One is we've got new income coming on from all these investments we have been making. Mid cycle that's a billionish to $1.5 billion. We have got nice tailwind probably from tax reform as you think about that. And then as we think about the investment opportunity universe [ph] it's really competitive out there. So I certainly don't see us increasing capital expenditures.","So on balance, if you think '12 to '17, we really hit the 60:40 allocation of reinvestment business versus giving cash back to shareholders. We are going to probably drift more towards a 50:50 number certainly in 2018\u20132019 as well looks like to us. So, will certainly be right towards the high-end of that range, Neil; we are not -- we go over it, we will just see how the year goes.","Neil Mehta","Appreciate that. And then follow-up is just on the refining macro. Greg, can you talk about -- and team talk a little bit both your view on the -- views on the product balances? We have seen gasoline build. It feels seasonal. Distillate has been strong, and then your thoughts on Brent TI [ph], because that's compressed by quite a bit over the last couple of weeks here as we think about the year?","Greg Garland","Do you want to take stab at that, Jeff? And then, I'll come in.","Jeff Dietert","Yes, I think as we look, the global economic indicators are really multiple year highs, both from a manufacturing and from a consumer confidence and unemployment, multi-year lows on unemployment. So, the economy looks good globally in all the major region. That's positive for the demand outlook. As we start the year and think back to last year, gasoline and distillate inventories on days of demand cover last year were above the 5-year range. And they shifted to the bottom of the 5-year range this year. So, the starting point certainly feels better. As we think about demand, we are seeing strong demand on the product export side. We had record exports in the fourth quarter, 260,000 barrels a day.","And then, as we look at Canadian production in particular continuing to grow with Fort Hills ramping up this year and really no major pipeline start ups for 2018 and 2019. The rails ramped up in the fourth quarter relative to third quarter, but it doesn't appear they have substantial excess capacity. So that's going to be a positive. And PSX is the largest importer of Canadian crudes, buying over 0.5 million barrels a day of Canadian crude. Lower taxes should benefit U.S. refiners. And then we have got the IMO bunker fuel specifications on the horizon. So, we are cautiously optimistic on the outlook for refining profitability this year.","Neil Mehta","Great, guys. Thank you very much.","Greg Garland","Thank you.","Operator","Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Doug Terreson","Good morning, everybody.","Greg Garland","Hey, Doug.","Jeff Dietert","Hi.","Doug Terreson","I also wanted to ask a question about your views on some of the likely market impacts of some of these new environment regulations that are set for the next few years. Meaning Jeff, mentioned IMO 2020. And then, we've got tier fuels too that I wanted to ask about, and how the company is positioned. So, the first, do you sense that the U.S. and global refining industries are investing enough to satisfy some of these roles? Second, do you envision margin to the key products such as the [indiscernible] fuels and crude oil spreads? How do you they are going to vary because of these mandates? And then, finally, how is the company positioned for these changes? Meaning, there's three parts to the questions is the industry ready in your view? Two, what do you think are the likely outcomes with spreads? And most importantly, how is Phillips 66 positioned for these new environmental mandates?","Greg Garland","Well, let me start backwards, and I will then pass it off to Jeff to talk about some of the details. So the answer how we are positioned, we are pretty through the Tier 3 investment period. And that's one reason you have seen our sustained capital come down in refining, Doug. In terms of IMO, we are not planning on making significant investments. There are probably some small things will do around the assets in terms of looking at yields and conversions. But, we don't view that necessarily as a negative impact on our business. I think we are constructive on what that does in terms of the distillate price. But, we are probably not as optimistic as some of the others are out there, although Jeff is pretty optimistic on it. So, I will let him talk you through what he thinks the impacts are going to be in terms of margins and maybe some of the other refiners out there.","Jeff Dietert","Yes, we are -- you are bringing up a source of internal debate that happens on a fairly regular basis. But, as we look at it, the IMO is about 4 million barrels a day in rough numbers. You take the scrubbers and probably non-compliance that might be a million barrels a day of it. There's a million barrels a day that might get blended up and end up with still about 2 million barrels of incremental diesel demand. And you compare that to the global demand of 35 million barrels a day, that's about a 6% increase, the meaningful increase upcoming. On the [indiscernible] side, it's also 2 million barrels a day [indiscernible] needs to be destroyed and that compares to a global coking capacity market in the 6 to 8 million barrel a day range. And a lot of that capacity is already highly utilized.","So, the industry is preparing in advance. The global system has flexibility, but these are meaningful shifts. As we think about what we are dealing. In 2017, we had about 15 projects that added 10,000 barrels a day of diesel production capability. In 2018, we've got about 30 projects that will add 20,000 barrels a day of clean product. That leans a little bit more towards gasoline, but there is diesel there as well. And so, these are low CapEx but high return projects.","Doug Terreson","Okay, thanks, Jeff, and congratulations everybody on your solid results.","Greg Garland","Right. Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Blake Fernandez from Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Blake Fernandez","Hey, folks, good morning. I wanted to go back on the WCS differentials. And Jeff, I think you mentioned you guys have access to over 500,000 barrels a day of Canadian crude. Can you help remind me I guess the actual access to that as far as is that piped, is that railed, a combination? I guess I am just trying to fish around to see how of this blow out in the differential you are actually going to realize?","Jeff Dietert","Yes, there is a big pipe component of it. It's primarily heavy and primarily vast majority of this utilized in our own refineries. We do import some offshore barrels. That's a small portion of the total. But, we are large buyers across the way. There is not much movement by rail at this point.","Blake Fernandez","Okay. So, it sounds like you've got pretty direct leverage to the differential move here.","Jeff Dietert","Right.","Blake Fernandez","Okay. And the second question, I guess, maybe shifting over to the Chemicals piece since we've got the cracker kind of coming online and ramping up into next quarter. It looks like some of the chain margins have maybe been trending below the $0.30 per pound, which I think is always kind of a mid-cycle proxy you guys use. I didn't know if you had any thoughts on that and if maybe some of the recent move in gas prices has kind of impacted the margins there?","Greg Garland","Yes, so let me just talk. So, margins in the quarter were up about $0.02 for the year. They're up about $0.03 in 2017. You kind of think about [indiscernible] came on in the fourth quarter. We had our polyethylene capacity up in the fourth quarter. So from a market basing standpoint, we were moving the products, and we believe that Exxon Mobil actually ran some of their derivative capacity in the fourth quarter also. So you're starting to see the impact of those products hit the market.","I think that in many ways the global economy is pretty good. You think about in U.S., think about Europe, you think about Asia, and it's really taking these materials without a lot of margin impact in -- to your point like, I think if you look at that full chain polyethylene margin based on a weighted average speed it is kind of hovering around $0.25 level, which is kind of reinvestment level economics mid-cycle if you want to think about it. You look at on ethane basis, that full chain margin is around $0.31, $0.32. And so those are the really healthy margins for us. And so, I think that we kind of look at the Chemicals businesses is getting this new cracker up, getting polyethylene in the market, maybe there's going to be some margin compression, you know, these other projects to come online in 2018, but I think you got to remember higher crude prices are very constructive for us. And we like high crude, low natural gas prices in the Chemicals business. And so, that'll open up the margins for CPChem."," ","Thanks, Greg.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey","Hi, guys. I'll start with the detail one if I could. You said utilization was up at 198% respectively over the past couple of quarters. It seems a bit lower in Q1. Could you just talk a little bit about some -- whether that's sort of a level number and what the outlook for you guys this is in terms of turnarounds over the coming year? And then, I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Greg Garland","Go ahead.","Kevin Mitchell","Yes, we provided guidance. You saw that the first quarter is a relatively heavy lift for us on maintenance. We are guided to $230 million to $260 million. First quarter of last year was $299 million, and that was that heaviest quarterly maintenance period in the last decade. So we're below last year, but still a meaningful lift for the first quarter.","Paul Sankey","Is there any bigger items that just that you can talk about?","Kevin Mitchell","I think as we look at it, last year was more crude unit heavy, and some of the downstream units, the conversion units are more impacted in this quarter.","Paul Sankey","Got it. Greg, if I can take it to a high level, you made an interesting comment that is always a debatable one regarding the intrinsic value, both the stock relative to your appetite buyback, could you just expand on that a little bit? Thank you.","Greg Garland","Sure. Well, we are never going to give you the number, but you can keep asking, Paul. But yes, so the way we think about intrinsic value, we're looking at kind of EBITDA two years out, we're using kind of historical multiples and some of the parts. And based on that, obviously it's a higher pricing what we're trading today and that's why we're buying shares today.","Paul Sankey","Yes, it's an interesting point. I mean. I don't think we haven't quite get to the answer on when the optimum time, I think you can read very long academic studies on the optimum times for buying back, but I guess just to follow-up, there's nothing really you have to do on the debt side, is that I mean it sounds that maturities or any other outlet for excess cash?","Greg Garland","That's right, Paul. Yes, nothing coming up in the near term.","Paul Sankey","Great, okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Justin Jenkins from Raymond James. Please go ahead your line is open.","Justin Jenkins","Great, thanks good morning everybody. I guess maybe just to start, Jeff; he made a few comments on the Canadian heavy differentials. Has there been any thoughts or discussions in terms of the asset profile of Refining? Are you comfortable with the asset base as it stands or any ownership structure of the WRB shifting on those lines?","Greg Garland","No, I think look, we're pretty happy with the portfolio today. We always look at the portfolio many times a year. We're always looking at it. But I just think as the portfolio lies today, we like the portfolio where it sits. [Indiscernible] been a great partner at WRB. And we continue to make investments there between the two of us. In fact, we're modernizing the FCC. It's one of the projects we have for 2018 there. So I would say portfolio is in pretty good shape.","Justin Jenkins","Perfect. Thanks, Greg. And then may be shifting on taxes, Kevin you mentioned in your opening remarks, but anything else to note as it relates to the earnings outside the U.S., whether it's tax payments over time for the new tax law or any plans to repatriate cash?","Kevin Mitchell","No, not specifically. I mean we with -- in terms of the foreign cash that the new tax law probably gives us access to a $1 billion, $1.02 billion of cash that previously was overseas, and we didn't have cost effective access to. So, it gives us gives a bit more flexibility in managing our overall cash. In reality, we have plenty of cash anyway. So it's not like we need to rush out for that, but it just helps them from an overall flexibility and managing the cash position.","Justin Jenkins","Perfect, thanks Kevin. I'll leave it there. Have a good weekend, guys.","Greg Garland","You too. Thank you.","Operator","Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys. Good morning. This is [indiscernible] on for Doug. I've got a couple questions, both macro-related. First, I wanted to see if I get an update on the performance at the LPG export business. I know in prior quarters, you guys have talked about the cargo turning near capacity, and I think you are working on doing some things optimized cost there. But the bigger piece of the EBITDA contribution is really ARB [ph] related and that hasn't been there in past quarters. I'm wondering if you can talk about whether that's improving against these positive demand trends in oil?","Greg Garland","So I'll start on that. I think that we've demonstrated 25% of the design capacity of the terminals. So I think we're loading like 10 cargos this month, did 96 in the fourth quarter. So we're running it to capacity, as you know, the ARB -- the fees has been around between $0.05 and $0.07 in that range. And that's substantially below what we had promised when we improved the project. So we think about what's coming at us particularly from the Permian, we see strong in geo growth in 2018. We think that utilization rates across the docks are going to come up, and the opportunity to move those dock fees and hence those margins across will improve as we move into the back-half of 2018, certainly as we get into 2019.","Kevin Mitchell","Yes. You saw the DOE monthly stats October and November NGL production up over 400,000 barrels a day year-on-year. I don't know if that pace is going to be sustained, but clearly we're seeing very strong growth on the NGL front, which is going to need to be exported. And that's going to help fill these pipelines. Based on DOE stats last year, LPG export facilities ran in the low 80s percentage utilization and we think that will move into the high 80s this year, which by the end of the year 2019 starts helping margins ","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks, guys. Second question, just kind of looking at the WTI brand spread today. It's nearing below $4. What do you think the appropriate ranges for the stainable WTI brand spread? What do you think set those parameters? And secondly, do you attribute any of this weakness to seasonality, perhaps staggered refinery maintenance profiles which means the Gulf Coast and the Mid-Continent post refinery maintenance could this perhaps start widening out again?","Kevin Mitchell","Well, I think if you look at just West Houston versus Brant it's traded around a buck-and-a-half, kind of $0.50 plus or minus. That part of the differential has been relatively stable. When you look at what's happening between Cushing and Permian and the Gulf Coast, we've seen substantial changes recently with those pipelines being very highly utilized, close to full in the October-November timeframe. Since that time, Valero's diamond pipeline has added 200,000 barrels a day out of Cushing. That's drawing pushing inventories down pretty rapidly. And from the Permian, the Midland-to-Sealy and the expansions of the existing added 700,000 barrels a day, so we've gone from a period of not enough capacity to too much capacity in the short-term. Permian, it's certainly possible; could grow 700,000 barrels a day this year, and be back to a very tight level by the end of the year, or certainly 2019. So that Cushing to Gulf Coast is going to swing more. Right now there's enough capacity and those rates are tightening. We'll see some seasonal impacts for maintenance, but I think those are the big drivers.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Phil Gresh","Yes, hi. Good morning. So Kevin, you probably know I was going to start with this one; so I'll get this one out of the way, but just the deferred tax fees in terms of the tax reform and the impacts and how you think about 2018 with the investments you have, kind of a cash tax versus book tax rate?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes, Phil, so I think the best way to look at that -- I don't want to go down the path of trying to give a cash tax rate, because you really know what your pre-tax income is to go there, but the way to model that is you can assume a deferred tax benefit for 2018 total company in the order of $400 million is what we're seeing. And so that predominantly reflects the additional tax depreciation over and above financial depreciation. So there is about $400 million benefit on cash flow relative to with the financial tax.","Phil Gresh","Okay, great. Thanks. Second question is on Midstream. If you look at the increased disclosure here in the filings this quarter, the run rate of EBITDA and Midstream adjusted basis, XTCP is around $1.2 billion annualized, and I know the guidance is for a longer term to -- I think by the end of '18 to be more like 1.8 billion to 2.0 billion. So could you talk about that path of trajectory towards the end of the year and what projects do you expect to contribute to the bulk of that?","Greg Garland","Yep. So I'll start. So, you're right. You take the kind of the 300 or so, 295 and annualized that you get to 1-2, and remember in that number of slides that we show that you got about $300 million or so refining with just -- that pushes you about $1.5. And there's about $300 million of growth in market that we've got laid in to the plan this year. And that number is kind of into your run rate number also. So, obviously, we got expansions on Sand Hills. We got second segment of Bayou Bridge. We got all the work we're doing around the Beaumont Terminal. There is a lot of multitude of projects in blending at various terminals across the system, and then you got organic growth at PSXP that's laid into that number. So that's -- I don't think the 300 growth rate or annualized run rate growth is going to be that big of a lift force in 2018. I think we'll hit that.","Phil Gresh","And so, are you implying that the $300 million on the refining side is likely to be dropped in '18 then, or is it just a categorization?","Greg Garland","No. That's just trying to highlight potential Midstream income that we had. It could be droppable. I suspect that refining incremented some of the very last step we get to, Phil.","Phil Gresh","Okay. Just one last question, in terms of -- there is some questions already in Canadian Heavy, I was just curious you're having some challenges of Wood River being able to get full access to crude of the Keystone, I know Keystone is still running I think at 80% right now. I'm just curious how your accessibility is to that Canadian crude at Wood River right now?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes, we still got access. Keystone is not fully backup, but it's running, and we've got access there that we need.","Phil Gresh","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Kristina Kazarian from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kristina Kazarian","Good afternoon, guys.","Greg Garland","Hey, Kristina.","Kevin Mitchell","Hi, Kristina.","Kristina Kazarian","Hi. Shifting back to the Chem segment, you guys mentioned the new cracker and associated key units will be fully commercial in 2Q. Can you just remind me, one, what the start up costs are? And two, how long it takes me from there to get kind of full utilization? And if I use some of the current margins we were talking about earlier in the call, what does that imply versus what we've talked about re-mid cycle guidance?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes. So I think that -- so polyethylene came up relatively quickly. It was running at almost full capacity utilization by the end of the quarter. But I suspect by the end of the second quarter, it'll be at full rate. And again remember, the polyethylene is the big pull on, and it's already out in the market. So it's just getting the cracker up to supply the ethylene going into the polyethylene. So I think it will be a fairly quick ramp up. I think it's kind of the $0.32 margins that we're looking at on the ethane margins, we're in the range of the kind of that 1-2ish billion of EBITDA, certainly 1 to 1.2, in that range, as you move back and you think about, that's a pretty close to that $0.25 mid-cycle case for the weighted average feed for the industry.","So, I think in today's margins were kind of there. You could see a little compression as we come up; Exxon is going to come up later in the year, but I still think that given strong fundamental demand in the business and there is not a lot of capacity coming on globally in Pet Chems in 2018, but we're still very constructive around margins for the balance of 2018.","Kristina Kazarian","And were there a start up cost number that you guys want to frac for me as well?","Kevin Mitchell","No.","Kristina Kazarian","Got it. Now, on the pipeline side, can you just maybe provide an update around the Open Season around the Gray Oak pipeline JV, and maybe talk about the benefits from a project like that and how I would be thinking about this project versus some of the other ones announced there? Would you maybe be willing to merge two together? And just general thoughts there.","Kevin Mitchell","Well, we're still in the midst of the Open Season. So it's probably not too appropriate to comment. I would say that high level of interest, and it was actually -- we were asked by many of the producers in the region to do this project. So there was a lot of interest going into it. And so yes, there is a lot of pipelines that have been announced, there is no question; I think that we have high levels of confidence that we'll get to a good endpoint on this project for Gray Oak.","Kristina Kazarian","Perfect. That's it from me. Look forward to that, thank you.","Kevin Mitchell","Thanks, Kristina.","Operator","Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Roger Read","Yes, thanks. Good morning.","Kevin Mitchell","Hey, good morning.","Roger Read","And maybe just a follow-up on Midstream piece, the target of getting to the 1.8 exit rate in '18, NGL and other was a nice contributor in the fourth quarter, and imagine higher oil prices are helping that out along with the increased volumes. But as you think about that improvement from kind of this Q4 exit Q4 of '18, how much are you thinking NGLs improve from here, or given the sort of price volatility on that that's actually a relatively small component of the improvement?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes, I would say that's a relatively small contributing piece to it.","Roger Read","So, in other words, if we get a stronger NGL pricing, we can think about easier to make the target or exceeding the target?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes. If oil prices continue to strengthen, that will support our NGL business and make it an easier lift to get to the 1.8. The difference between the 1.8 and 2 is really market-related. And so, I would put it in that category.","Roger Read","Okay, thank you.","Greg Garland","As a 1.8 number, we've got about a $150 million laid in for the frac and for the exports. So we've been pretty conservative in our view of what that project contributes in 2018. I do think as we come into back half of the year, we're going to like the dock piece a lot better, but a lot of that's just growth in organic growth at PSXP for some of the expansions we have going on the pipe. And so, we just -- lot of this is more pipeline type volumes, the terminal type that activity versus NGL improvement.","Roger Read","No. That's helpful. Thanks. And then, hasn't really been hit on this call, I don't believe, it come up on the prior ones; potential reform of the RFS, do you have any thoughts on it? I know I could guess what your view would be, but just curious if you have any views on the potential for that? Was it picking up, gone the Corn State Senators actually talking to the Oil State Senators instead of holding each other hostage on their appointments?","Greg Garland","Well, I think you answered the question for me. Look, we're all in on this. We think it's a right thing to do. We think the legislation is fraud, we're adding our voice at Capitol Hill. I agree with you, I think that the dialog particularly from the Senate side with the Texas Senators and the Corn State Senators is constructive and helpful. Congressman Walden and Hoff continue to be very helpful in terms of moving the dialog forward. My only concern is there is still a lot on Congress's plate. I think that making recommendations about what this Congress is or isn't going to get accomplished just for referral, and so we will just have to see. I just don't think RFS reform is one of the top cards of their agenda. And then you move in a back half year with the election year, I think it's harder to get things done. So if it's not done early in the year, I think it gets pushed.","Roger Read","Okay, great. Thank you.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Spiro Dounis from UBS Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Spiro Dounis","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to comeback capital allocation, but focus a little more maybe it's on the dividend. I think we are still about a quarter or so we definitely announced any change there, but just kind of looking for a framework on how you are thinking about that relation. So last year's 11% increase and obviously a lot of project startups this year. And then, of course any benefits from tax reform?","Greg Garland","Well, so I think going to pure competitive dividend as what we always frame that answer. We think about, it's got to be affordable, it's got to be, we want to continue to grow the dividend every year. We look at where we said versus our refining competitors and other industry competitors were except versus yield on the kind of the S&P 100 and you kind of take all that in, but certainly you should expect that we will increase the dividend this year and I will just leave it to that.","Spiro Dounis","Fair enough. And then just one follow-up on CPChem, I think you guys ran down the inventory there in the third quarter. I don't expect any way you got a chance to really ramp them back up in fourth quarter with Cedar Bayou down but as you head into 1Q now, I would see the value back up. Would you expect to sort of refill that inventory, just trying to get a sense of if 1Q performance is also slowly a way down a bit as you sort of refill the inventory?","Greg Garland","Well, I think we start up on the new crack and obviously as you think about the startup of that cracker that will certainly impact those balances. We pull down inventories A because Cedar was down but B because we are running the polyethylene units at Old Ocean also. So you have that kind of that combination going on and of course the hurricane impacted the entire industry there on the Gulf Coast. Yes, I would say we normalize inventories at CPChem going forward. But you know, there is not a reason to hold a lot of high inventory in my view at CPChem or anyplace in our chains, we try to manage that working capital really tightly and I would say we are constructive demand, what we see. So typically seasonally first quarter is weak in terms of petrochemical demand, a lot of that's on the Chinese New Year and what you see going on there but we've seen continued good buying activity out of Asia really hasn't been impacted this year. So seasonally strong coming into the first quarter, so we like what we see in the demand side on petchem.","Spiro Dounis","Great. Thanks for the color Greg. I appreciate it.","Operator","Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ryan Todd","Okay, thanks. Maybe a follow-up on some of the earlier questions on CPChem, I think previously you've spoken to $600 million to $800 million here in distributions. Can you maybe update on the trajectory of how we should think about over the course of the year. Will we see any distributions in the first and second quarter or will that mostly be weighted towards the second half?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes, Ryan. It's Kevin, I think what you will see on that is it's probably going to be a little bit weighted towards the second half of the year. I don't want to refer from that we won't receive any distributions in the first half. I think first quarter is probably unlikely just given that we are just getting the cracker you know, that just start coming up in during the first quarter and bring that up to full operations. So you'll probably see it kind of more from second quarter on through the year.","Ryan Todd","Okay, thanks. And then, maybe just anytime as you might have on the west coast. I mean, the west coast was problematic during the -- in terms of refining margins during the fourth quarter high utilization and number of other things happen, but can you - any updates on yourselves how you see the rest of the first quarter either from a turnaround activity, you switch to some gasoline and how you expect margins to trend there over the next few months?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes, I think west coast in December. December is typically a weak period. The industry ran well with high utilization rates, we had some weather influences negatively impact demand and so it's a tough time here and things got weak. As you look into the first quarter, there is maintenance on the west coast in January in January that's kind of support the crack here. It looks like after the current turnarounds are completed, it looks a little bit light on the west coast. Mid-Continent looks like it's for the industry or relatively heavy refining maintenance period and there is some maintenance relatively large on the PADD I as well. Internationally, it looks like relatively heavy or close above normal, let's call it rather than heavy maintenance season this spring with backend loaded kind of March, April, May timeframe.","Ryan Todd","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Craig Shere","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So on the export terminal, LPG export terminal, it sounds like ongoing optimism going out in the second half and it's '19, what do you think the prospects are in the coming 12 months, maybe 18 months of expanding the amount of contract and position on that facility?","Greg Garland","As our prices are, you suddenly want to expand your contracts at the bottom; it's kind of our view. You know, look hey I sometime in '19 we are probably going hit limits in terms of industry, capacity to clear the barrels and you kind of need a $0.10 to $0.12 fee across the doc to justify new investment and so I think we will get there but a lot of it depends on what's going on in the Permian and how many NGLs are going to be showing up, we remain constructive around our views on that.","Craig Shere","Do you think that the market will be supportive enough to get longer term contracting five to ten years or you think when we start to settle a couple of years of the time?","Greg Garland","It can be a couple of years at a time in this environment. We will see a surprise if you can write five year paper.","Craig Shere","Understood. And last question. On the balance sheet management, I understand there is not a lot of debt coming to [indiscernible] for a while. You do have -- if I'm not mistaken a couple of billion chunk out to 2022, how do you think about building cash balances and expectation of a large managing a large maturity like that, would you be willing to hold outsize cash balances for couple of years?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes, Craig. It's Kevin. I - we may build cash simply by virtue of strong operating cash flow and depending on where overall capital fits, how much what is going on from a capital expenditure standpoint and then the other side of that with distributions, dividends and buybacks. But I don't think we would be building cash just for the purpose to upholding it to pay time debt for years out from this point. We have a lot of flexibility from a balance sheet debt management standpoint and so given the strength for the balance sheet to credit rating that we got we can easily refinance maturities as they come to that's what we choose to do, so. I would look at cash balances more from a broader picture in terms of what it means from a capital allocation standpoint.","Craig Shere","Understood. And that Kevin, I got you. That 1 billion to 1.2 billion of foreign cash, is it pretty nominal cost to bring that back, if you wanted in the future?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes, that's the point that post tax reform we now have access to that cash without having to pay any excess U.S. taxes.","Craig Shere","Oh, zero. Okay. Thanks.","Kevin Mitchell","Thanks. Because we pay the repatriation tax upfront -- the group repatriation.","Greg Garland","We paid in advance on that one.","Kevin Mitchell","Yes, we paid it, yes.","Craig Shere","Thank you.","Operator","Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brad Heffern","Hey, good morning everyone. I will start with sort of a macro question with kind of tied into the WTA brand conversation. I'm just wondering if you guys have a perspective on crude export capacity in the U.S. I think you said earlier in the call, Permian could grow 700,000 barrels a day that's probably pushing us into the over 2 million barrels a day of export. So you would run into a wall at some point on that?","Greg Garland","Yes, it's a good question. I think with the hurricane back in the fall, we found out that we can export 2 million barrels a day. We thought that might have been the max we could export at that time, and perhaps it was, because we hadn't gone materially higher than that. But I think there is a need for continued infrastructure to get the Permian barrels to the shore, and the majority of the increase in production is going to be exported. And so, as you look at oil production growing over 1 million barrels a day here at the end of 2017 with continued improvement in IP rates and drilling efficiency gains, the drilled but uncompleted well count continue to go up during this increase in production. So it looks to us like there is going to be sustained, strong production growth in the U.S. and that more infrastructure will be needed.","Brad Heffern","Okay, thanks, got it. And I guess, switching over to DCP, you know, Enbridge has labeled that as an un-core [ph], so how do you guys feel about owning half of the GP versus potentially taking out more of it?","Kevin Mitchell","I feel happy with the structure as it is today. There is no question, I mean Enbridge is great company, and we are finding another ways to work together. Gray Oak is a great example of that. And so, we continue to like DCP, we like their positions in the Permian, the Eagle Ford, the Mid-Con, the DJ. DCP has done a nice job of managing this business through really tough time, and they are coming out the other end. And so, EBITDA is growing nicely. They have some great growth profiles in front of them. So, you know, fundamentally we like the asset, the [indiscernible] goes with our partner.","Brad Heffern","Okay, appreciate it. Thanks.","Kevin Mitchell","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. We have now reached the time limit available for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeff Dietert","Yes, thank you. I appreciate your interest in Phillips 66. If there is any follow-up calls, please contact Rosy or me.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I now will turn the call over to Jeff Dietert. Jeff, you may begin.","Jeff Dietert - Phillips 66","Good morning, and welcome to the Phillips 66 first quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today's call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tim Taylor, President; and Kevin Mitchell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","The presentation materials we will be using during the call today can be found on the Phillips 66's website along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide two contains our Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our question and answer session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings.","With that, I will turn the call over to Greg Garland for some opening comments.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Thanks, Jeff. Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before we get started, I would like to welcome Jeff Dietert to the Phillips 66 team. Jeff, we are really glad that you are with us today. So, during the quarter we successfully completed several major turnarounds in Refining and Chemicals. This represents our highest level of turnaround activity in a quarter since the formation of our company. Our first quarter earnings largely reflect the impact of this downtime, but also highlight the benefit of our diversified and engraved portfolio.","Our Chemicals business had solid results on strong demand and improved margins. We continue to successfully execute our Midstream growth program. Several of the largest projects we have been investing in over the last few years have now been completed, or almost complete. The LPG Export Terminal at Freeport, Texas, which is part of our Sweeny Hub complex was completed late last year.","The facility operates at designed capacity in the first quarter and we are supplying customers in Europe, Latin America and Asia. We are currently evaluating opportunities to build additional fractionation capacity at Sweeny and other Gulf Coast locations, and we expect to reach FID later this year. Construction on the Dakota Access, ETCO pipeline is complete.","Line fill is nearly finished, and we expect these pipelines to begin delivering Bakken crude to the Midwest and the Gulf Coast by June. Phillips 66 has a 25% interest in both of these lines. Our Beaumont Terminal expansion is ongoing. Recently, we added 2 million barrels of contracted crude storage. This morning, we FIDed additional five crude tanks, which will add another 2 million barrels of contacted crude storage by 2018. By mid-year we expect to add another 1.2 million barrels of product storage.","As crude and product exports grow, Beaumont is well positioned to generate additional earnings. Phillips 66 Partners remains an important part of our Midstream growth strategy. We expect Partners to reach its growth goal of $1.1 billion in run rate EBITDA by the end of 2018. In addition to drop-downs to the partnership, PSXP is pursuing a number of organic growth initiatives.","Progress continues on Partners' Bayou Bridge JV pipeline, which currently runs from our Beaumont Terminal to Lake Charles, Louisiana. The line is also being extended from Lake Charles to St. James.","Earlier today, the development of a new isomerization unit was announced by Phillips 66 Partners. This project will provide fee-based earnings to the partnership and will increase the Lake Charles refinery's production of higher octane gasoline blend components. DCP Midstream simplified its corporate structure in January. The new structure better positions DCP for growth and improves capital allocation. DCP has successfully reduced its operating costs and returned to profitability. We expect to receive distributions from DCP in the second quarter.","In Chemicals, CPChem is advancing the U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project. The polyethylene units are on track to complete midyear, and the ethane cracker in the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect CPChem distributions to improve significantly with earnings contributions from these assets and reduced capital spending once the project is completed.","In Refining, we are pursuing high return, quick payout projects. At the Billings Refinery, we're increasing heavy crude processing capability to 100%. This project is expected to be finished later this quarter.","At Bayway and Wood River refineries, we're modernizing FCC units to increase clean product yields. Both of these projects are expected to complete in the first half of 2018.","We continue to remain \u2013 maintain our commitment to our distributions to our shareholders. During the first quarter, we returned over $600 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We remain committed to our strategy, executing our growth plans, enhancing returns and rewarding our shareholders. The projects we have coming online, they're well-positioned to increase cash flow. We believe our integrated downstream portfolio remains a differentiating factor that provides upside in a rising U.S. production environment.","Before I turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results, I'd just like to note that Monday will be our fifth year anniversary as a company. I want to thank all of our employees, contractors, business partners, the communities where we live and work, as well as the owners of our company and our board who have all enables us to accomplish so much in these past five years.","Kevin?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Thanks, Greg. Good morning. Starting on slide four, first quarter earnings were $535 million. We had two special items that netted to a benefit of $241 million.","In Refining, we recognized a $261 million gain from the consolidation of the Merey Sweeny LP coking venture following the resolution of an ownership dispute. And in Chemicals, we had a $20 million charge related to an impairment of a CPChem joint venture. After removing these items, adjusted earnings were $294 million or $0.56 per share.","Cash from operations for the quarter was negative $549 million. This includes a negative $1.3 billion working capital impact. Excluding working capital, cash from operations was $748 million.","Capital spending for the quarter was $470 million, with approximately $270 million spent on growth.","Distributions to shareholders in the first quarter totaled $611 million, including $326 million in dividends and $285 million in share repurchases.","We finished the quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 27%. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 21%, reflecting a higher-than-typical proportion of earnings from lower tax jurisdictions.","Slide five compares first quarter and fourth quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings increased by $211 million, driven by improvements across all of our operating segments.","Slide six shows our Midstream results. After removing non-controlling interest of $35 million, Midstream's first quarter adjusted earnings were $77 million, $44 million higher than the fourth quarter.","Transportation-adjusted earnings for the quarter were $56 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by lower seasonal maintenance spend and increased equity earnings.","In NGL, we had adjusted earnings of $4 million. This represented a $9 million increase and was largely driven by increased earnings from the Sweeny Hub assets.","DCP Midstream had adjusted earnings of $17 million in the first quarter. The improvement over the fourth quarter reflects the benefit from hedges and lower operating costs, partially offset by reduced volumes.","Turning to Chemicals on slide seven, first quarter adjusted earnings for the segment were $201 million, $77 million higher than in the fourth quarter. In Olefins and Polyolefins, adjusted earnings increased by $56 million, primarily due to improved margins, higher volumes driven by strong polyethylene demand and lower operating costs.","Global O&P utilization was 89%, 3% higher than the prior quarter. Both periods were impacted by significant turnaround activity.","Adjusted earnings for SA&S increased by $21 million due to higher margins and a gain on CPChem's sale of its K-Resin business.","In Refining, crude utilization was 84% for the quarter, comparable with our low 80%s guidance. Pre-tax turnaround costs were $299 million. During the quarter, we had major turnarounds at the Ferndale, Bayway, Lake Charles and Wood River refineries. Clean product yield was 85%, down slightly from the previous quarter. Realized margin was $8.55 per barrel, up $2.08 from the fourth quarter.","The chart on slide eight provides a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings. In total, the Refining segment had an adjusted loss of $2 million, a $93 million improvement from last quarter. Adjusted earnings in the Atlantic Basin were lower by $148 million. Market cracks decreased by 25% during the first quarter, and capacity utilization fell to 70% from 102% as Bayway completed a major turnaround. This decrease in Atlantic Basin earnings was more than offset by improvements in the other regions, primarily due to improved margin realizations.","In the Gulf Coast, market cracks were slightly higher in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter and capture rates improved to 75% from 45%. The increase in capture is largely due to better clean product differentials. This includes pricing on cyclohexane, propylene, and benzene, as well as the absence of negative impacts from timing of product shipments made last quarter during a rising price environment.","The improvement in the West Coast reflects higher volumes due the completion of fourth quarter turnaround activity at the Los Angeles Refinery along with higher margins. This was partially offset by a major turnaround at the Ferndale Refinery this quarter.","Slide nine covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the quarter was $12.24 per barrel compared to $12.10 in the fourth quarter. Our realized margin for the first quarter was $8.55 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 70%, significantly higher than the 53% achieved in the prior quarter. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries. This quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack.","Losses from secondary products of $2.66 per barrel were in line with the previous quarter, despite rising crude costs, as NGL and fuel oil prices increased. Feedstock advantage improved realizations by $1.58 per barrel, $0.14 per barrel less than the fourth quarter. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. This category improved by $2.49 per barrel from the prior quarter, primarily due to wider clean product differentials and lower RINs costs.","Let's move to Marketing and Specialties on slide 10. Adjusted earnings for M&S for the first quarter were $141 million, similar to the fourth quarter. In Marketing and Other, the $10 million increase in adjusted earnings was largely due to higher realized margins, despite negative impacts from lower RIN prices. Higher margins were partially offset by lower volumes. Specialties adjusted earnings decreased by $9 million, primarily due to turnaround activity at the Excel Paralubes joint venture, which continued into the second quarter.","On slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted after-tax net costs of $123 million this quarter, compared to $119 million in the fourth quarter. The increase in net costs reflects higher interest expense and lower capitalized interest due to project start-ups, partially offset by lower environmental accruals.","Slide 12 shows the change in cash during the first quarter. We entered the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations for the first quarter was $748 million. Working capital changes decreased cash flow by $1.3 billion, largely due to a seasonal inventory build.","We funded $470 million of capital expenditures and investments, and distributed over $600 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We ended the first quarter with 516 million shares outstanding.","We had $500 million of other cash flows. This category includes loan repayments from our WRB and DAPL joint ventures. At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was $1.5 billion.","This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next I'll cover a few outlook items.","In the second quarter in Chemicals we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90%s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90%s. And before tax turnaround expenses to be between $130 million and $160 million. We expect Corporate & Other Costs to come in between $125 million and $140 million after-tax.","With that we'll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Doug Terreson is online with a question. Your line is now open.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, everybody, and congratulations on your strong results.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Thanks, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","My question is on cash. And specifically while there was a decline in the position in the quarter, seasonality is normally high in this area for you guys during the first quarter because of turnarounds and other factors, too. So my question is, do you expect the normal seasonal pattern of sources and uses of cash to repeat itself again in 2017 for the company? And second, could you specify the factors that affected the change in working capital during the first quarter that you showed on one of the slides and also just comment on whether or not they're going recur in coming periods?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yes, Doug. This is Kevin. I mean you're right in terms of the seasonal comment. I mean as we think about cash and working capital, where we ended the quarter at $1.5 billion was actually right in line with our expectations. Our plan had us right at that level at the end of the first quarter. We typically have the seasonal inventory build in the first quarter. And if you look back historically, typically, the first quarter is a use of cash from a working capital standpoint. And the normal kind of seasonal trends would apply. So this time you had the increase in inventory, which dominates that change in working capital, and it's the normal seasonal effect, but also with a heavy maintenance turnaround schedule that we had, you had some additional impact from that.","We also had some line fill \u2013 downhole line fill contributed to that also. And then the other component from a working capital standpoint, because of the extent of the downtime which was weighted towards the end of the first quarter, so March was our highest downtime month. You actually had a bit of a rundown in payables over the course of the first quarter, and so you'd expect that to come back. And actually, as we look at it, as of yesterday, sort of end of April on an apples-to-apples basis, our cash balance is sitting at just over $2 billion. So you've already seen some of that come back. I wouldn't go so far as to say you can absolutely assume that the entire $1.3 billion comes back over the course of the year, but certainly some of it does.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot. That's very clear.","Operator","It's Justin Jenkins with Raymond James on line with a question. Your line is open.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess I got a couple on the Midstream front. Greg, you mentioned in your remarks that we've got a lot of assets at PSX that have recently reached completion or are about to, and all those look pretty attractive to move into PSXP and would also presumably have a high tax basis, making it attractive for PSX as well. So I guess just from a high level, would those assets make sense as the next candidates for drop? And then would it also be reasonable to assume that a full quarter or two of operational data is maybe the hurdle before drop-downs?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Well, we like those assets, obviously, and they're certainly good candidates for drop at some point in time. We typically don't give guidance on what assets are coming next in terms of a drop. But certainly, there's always a point that those assets someday will end up at PSXP in terms of the Midstream assets.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then on the Rodeo project proposed in the quarter, can we get a sense maybe on how that's progressing and maybe the strategy on building those type of upstream facing assets, whether it's PSX or PSXP versus maybe looking at third-party M&A opportunities?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yes. This is Tim Taylor. Rodeo project is in the Permian and it's really a gathering system that we looked at. So we're already there operating in that with pipeline operations, so it's a nice way to extend what we have there. There is also, as everyone knows, a very active basin now in terms of additional production. So, we are in those discussions with producers, and I think there's a lot of opportunity with that. And that will develop here over the next few months to see if it's a go-forward investment for us and so I think it's just part of our extension of continuing to look for organic projects where we can in the growth basins or in the growth markets to build on our presence there.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the color.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Thank you.","Operator","And we have Phil Gresh with JPMorgan on line with a question. Your line is open.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, there. Good afternoon. The first question, just on the Refining performance in the quarter, Kevin you talked about the other bucket, which if I look at a couple other regions, Atlantic Basin, Gulf Coast, is actually \u2013 is a positive contributor. Typically, there is some amount of negative contribution there, and you had mentioned RINs. So I was just wondering if actually RINs was a positive in the quarter potentially.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","No.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","One of your peers did mention this. So I was curious.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","No, definitely not. RINs is still a reduction to the realized margin, it's just a less of a reduction with the RINs prices coming down over the period. The other \u2013 but it is part of the improvement, the relative improvement quarter-over-quarter. And then the bigger item are the clean product differentials that I talked about. Some of the non-gasoline distillate clean products and also the absence of the timing effects on those product shipments from last quarter.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Okay. Second question is just you're going to be running around 95% utilization in the second quarter, up from 84% in the first quarter. We are seeing several other companies in the industry talk similarly. So, Greg, I am just wondering how you feel about the outlook for Refining margins as we move into the summer here. We're already starting to see build in product inventories and it just seems like these runs numbers are quite high. So curious what your view is.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes, I think we've always said that we felt like 2017 was going to look a lot like 2016, particularly in the front half of the year. And we always had hope that the back half might clear and we see the opportunity for some margin improvement. I think you should also expect, though, you would have significant turnaround activity in the industry and we always come up and everyone runs better. Assets are clean, they are ready to go and people are going to run.","So I think that coupled with certainly through the first quarter and into early April, on the demand side, it looks flattish to us at best on gasoline demand. Maybe distillate demand is going to be a little better. So I would say those are concerns for us as we think in the back half of the year. I think, Jeff, if you want to comment a little bit on the economy. I think we are getting more positive in the economy, so we think about the back half of the year, maybe excluding the first quarter GDP results that came out this morning.","Jeff Dietert - Phillips 66","Yes, GDP results were a little bit lower than the consensus, but there were a number of items worth highlighting. U.S. consumer confidence was very high. The April number was the second highest since 2001. When you look at the U.S. manufacturing PMI statistics, they're at the high-end of the five-year range, business investment up 9% year-on-year. So some of the factors that drive gasoline demand and diesel demand have been strong domestically and PMI's have been improving internationally across Europe and Asia as well.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes, I think our view \u2013 and same thing in the petrochemicals business. We are seeing good, solid demand, really globally, at the petrochemicals business. So you kind of factor in \u2013 we may actually have better economic conditions in 2017 versus 2016 and that should be a positive direction for us. You want to comment, Tim?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","I just think on the demand side, it's flattish or same side store sales, when we look at the retail side of our business, the market side, we were down about half a percent in the first quarter. I think we're really \u2013 what you have to see to balance the market is you've got to see some uptick now in the summer driving season and you've got to balance with some exports. And we have seen good demand there, but I think those are two key parts of how you get the demand to catch up with the supply piece. And that's going to be the critical verticals that watch going forward.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Jeff Dietert - Phillips 66","I just might mention the emphasis on exports as well. We had a very strong fourth quarter, 175,000 barrels a day of product exports. The first quarter number was 144,000 barrels a day, a little bit softer due to some maintenance at Alliance, which is one of our major export facilities. But also we are positioning the portfolio for continued export growth at Beaumont, where we have 400,000 barrels a day going to 600,000 barrels a day of crude and product export capacity.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Okay. And then just last question is just on the capital spending. The first quarter number was actually quite low, and especially on Midstream we haven't seen a number this low in a while. So just curious how you're expecting that to progress, do you expect the Midstream spend to start ramping up or should we be thinking maybe that the guidance have some room to come down?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yeah, I wouldn't annualize that first quarter number, certainly. It's clear, we finished the heavy lifting around the Sweeny Hub project. And I think purposely as we thought about the 2017 capital budget, we've built in quite a bit of flexibility. We had some concern over margins and cash generation in 2017, so we left ourselves a lot of flexibility this year to adjust CapEx if needed. But I do think that \u2013 we're still guiding to the 2.7 (25:39) today, mid-year we'll give you an update on that, but we have a lot \u2013 and we have a lot of good opportunities. I think, you think about FID'ing the frac but we've always thought that would be the back-half of the year. And so I think you will see things pick up, Phil.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, Greg.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","You bet.","Operator","Ed Westlake is on line with a question with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yes. Good morning. Thanks for your time this morning. Just on the Chemicals. Obviously one of the big, big drivers of the improvement in cash flow as you look into 2018 is going to be not spending on the cracker and getting your share of the EBITDA, and then distributions. Maybe just a reminder of just sort of the latest thoughts on CapEx in 2017 and then 2018 at CPChem. And then a question on how the processes of distributions, presumably there'll be a board meeting at some point early next year, and if the cracker is up and running you'll decide to increase distributions, maybe some color there? Thank you.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yeah, well, just a couple. So CPChem's budget this year is $1.375 billion, and I think they're probably going to be right on top of that number it looks like to us at this point in time. But that's down quite a bit, about $600 million from last year. So certainly we are finishing up the polyethylene units, the cracker will be towards the end of the year as we finish that up.","And then so that should generate between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion mid-cycle at the CPChem level, so we're anxious to see that. I mean the policy of CPChem is essentially to distribute the cash. We pay all the expenses, but then most of the cash gets distributed. I think the \u2013 I mean, the question a lot of people have is when is the second cracker coming? And I suspect that we would not FID the second cracker in 2018. It could be towards the end \u2013 or 2019 is what we're looking at right now. So I think our expectation is we'll have a full year of 2018 cash flow out of the new project. And, Tim, you may want to comment on timing.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yeah. So as we look at the Gulf Coast project, as Greg alluded to in his comments, the polyethylene unit completes this summer. We should start to see the earnings impact on those derivatives in the third and fourth quarters, you got to get through the startup piece of that.","And then the cracker completing late in the year in the fourth quarter, we really see the earnings for the full stream really come on in the first half of 2018 to hit that run rate EBITDA. But I think we've got a very strong possibility that we've got a much increased cash flow that translates back to distributions to the owners.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yeah, Ed, this is Kevin. I would just add, we are expecting distributions from CPChem this year. We haven't had discretionary distributions in a little while, but we are anticipating some of that starting this year. Obviously that will increase quite a bit next year with the combination of capital coming down and the EBITDA from the new project.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","And then one for, Tim, just on \u2013 always good color on the NGL arb and exports. Maybe we just need higher prices, but it does feel like there's going to be a wall of NGLs coming, and so there should be some excess return from the infrastructure you're putting in. But any comment on the current market conditions would be helpful.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yeah. Well, it's been interesting. In the first quarter the LPG markets in general, whether it be ethane, propane, butane, have really entered into the cracking slate. So fairly \u2013 some variability during the quarter in each of those components being favored. So that kind of added some demand on the propane, butane side.","We've continued to export very heavily as an industry, almost 1 million barrels a day of propane. And so we've seen inventories fall. And so I think the demand-side has been really strong. The challenge is we need more supply from our perspective to really load that. But the high propane prices narrowed the arb into various markets. So if it continues, but we need to see more volume supply side to really widen that and a little bit higher crude price.","So I think as we look forward, we think NGLs will continue to come on stream based on what we see, building into 2018. But we think in front of that, in 2017, we would expect the international arb to be a bit narrower until we get that piece sorted out.","But overall, we're seeing a lot of production opportunity developing, and that's why it still gives us a very bullish case we believe long-term on the NGL supply, chemicals production here, as well as exports out of the U.S.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Paul Cheng with Barclays is online with a question. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning or good afternoon from New York.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Hey, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, I think, Greg, that you mentioned that the new ethane cracker, once that is fully operational, $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion EBITDA mid-cycle. How you define as mid-cycle? Or that if you can tell us maybe the other way, is that based on the first quarter market condition, what that EBITDA contribution may look like?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Paul, just \u2013 yeah. So that cracker's about 3.3 billion pounds a year of ethylene. And so very simply, if you think that the first quarter cash margins in that low $0.30 per pound range. So when you multiply that out, you get about $1 billion at today's conditions, maybe slightly more.","And as we think longer-term, we think with continued low ethane pricing, improvement strengthening the crude, that that comes up another \u2013 into the mid-cycle range in the mid-$0.30s, which drives the $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So based on the first quarter, it's about $1 billion?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yeah, I would say...","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's (31:49) polyethylene?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yes. That's the full chain. So that's polyethylene plus the ethylene.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And, Tim, do you have maybe some number can share about the LPG Export Terminal and the NGL fractionator, what's the run rate in the first quarter? And what kind of EBITDA contribution there may be?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","So the LPG Export Terminal, we ran it \u2013 eight cargos a month is kind of what we define as capacity. We hit that. But overall utilization was in the 90% range, a little bit higher.","On the fractionator, we were still running in the mid-80s, 80,000 barrels a day and 100,000 barrels a day. We've just recently been successful optimizing that unit a little bit right around 100,000 barrels a day at capacity. So I think we continue to find ways to improve and optimize around the asset.","I think the run rate EBITDA, I'd still say very dependent on the arb, but we're somewhere in the range. If you look at the total, we're probably still in the range of around $200 million for the year, I would say, in these current market conditions. Just because the differentials between the U.S. and Asia and Europe are expected to remain pretty narrow.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Kevin, that first quarter turnaround cost end up to be lower than your previous guidance. Does \u2013 it means that for the full year, we should correspondingly assume it's going to be lower by the same amount? Or that the full year turnaround costs will still be about the same?","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yeah, Paul, we haven't revised the full year guidance number. But it probably pushes you more to the lower end. We gave a pretty big range, $625 million to $675 million. And so realistically it probably pushes you more to the lower end of that range.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Or maybe let me ask it in this way. I mean the lower in the first quarter turnaround costs is just because you guys have been doing a better job and coming in below the budget. And maybe that even a little bit faster, not because that you have pushed some of the activity into the other quarters? Right?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Right. Right. For the most \u2013 that's right.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","(34:08) that If you don't have cost overrun in the remainder of the year that we should see the same amount of that being come down in the full year.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Right.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","In theory.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Right.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And final question that, Tim, for DAPL. With that up and running, does the pipeline operation, will in any shape or form, change the way how you source your refinery crew (34:32) or how you run your refinery? Or that doesn't really impact you, because that is not going all the way to the Louisiana side yet?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","I didn't catch the last part of that, Paul. Not going all the way...","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","To Louisiana, since that (34:47) refinery in the Gulf Coast is in Louisiana.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yeah. Well, we've seen recently the disruption in heavy Canadian crude has put a call on the Bakken crude in the northern tier. So I think as we think about DAPL startup, we see pretty good pull on that supply, generally. Certainly for some of our refining operation, that remains a very viable supply. You bring it to the Gulf Coast, you get to Beaumont. We've got the opportunity to get to Lake Charles. We're working on the extension to St. James. So I think then, you now see light crude from North Dakota lining in the Gulf Coast and you're going to see some rebalancing.","So I think as we look at it, it all depends on the yield and the pricing. But we think Bakken will be an attractive supply crude within our system, particularly in Louisiana and in Wood River and some of our Mid-Con refineries. So I think that, from our standpoint, it's always good to have that extra option. And in the end, I think it helps rebalance the light sweet crudes on the Gulf Coast.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","But have you make any changes to your operation yet or not really?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","No. When we look at the Bakken, it's just really nothing required much there from the different \u2013 from what we've run traditionally in a light crude unit.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs is online with a question. Your line is open.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys, and, Jeff, congratulations on the new role. It's great to have you on the other side.","Jeff Dietert - Phillips 66","Thanks, Neil.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","A couple questions on the crude side of the equation. And I guess the first is related to the OPEC cut and the potential extension later in May and your thoughts on the impact of the reduction in OPEC's supply on the light, heavy, and the medium sour barrels for your coastal refineries.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yeah. On the OPEC, we're still seeing evidence of good compliance from the standpoint of OPEC reducing that. It certainly impacted the supply of medium and heavy sour crudes. And then you've had the Canadian crude outage as well, so that alone has kind of bid up, if you will, the price of the heavy medium sours. And then you put increased production of light crudes in the U.S. on top of that and you've seen that narrow.","So our expectation is that this tightness lasts until the Canadian crude comes back on, widens out a bit. But depending on how much OPEC continues with the cut, that could continue to keep that differential tighter but maybe widening a bit with Canadian supply coming back. But I think generally, our view is it's still going to remain tighter than what it has been, say, for the last several years just because of the increased light and decreased supply of heavy sour.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And...","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sorry, go ahead.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I just \u2013 I think our base case assumes that there's extension on May 25 in terms of OPEC.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. It seems like we're lining up that way. The follow-up is just on U.S. oil production. As it continues to tick up, it feels like more of this light crude is coming down to the Gulf Coast. And there's increasing questions we're getting from investors about crude export capacity, and so it's more of a macro question for you guys. If the U.S. continues to grow at this 800,000 to 900,000 barrel a day annual pace, do you think we have enough crude export capacity on the Gulf Coast to clear the basin? And, ultimately, there's more crude export capacity to be built?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","I think there's capacity today. We talked about Beaumont. Greg talked about that going to 600,000 barrels a day. You can always look at additional capacity there as well. And then you look around the system. And as you start to get beyond that utilization, perhaps there's an opportunity. So I think everyone is looking in the Texas Gulf Coast, Louisiana Gulf Coast at ways to increase export capability. And so our view would be is you may get some shorter-term tightness, but we'll probably find ways to continue to export should that continue to grow but it's also an infrastructure opportunity like what we're seeing around the Beaumont Terminal.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I think our view \u2013 certainly, we've demonstrated we can export, as an industry, over 1 million barrels a day pretty efficiently. I think as you start approaching that 2 million barrel a day mark, though, I think there's going to be additional investment required, is our view. And then the other issues, I think Luke (39:34) is probably the only facility that could really handle the big ones...","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Correct.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","...very large crude carriers. And to my knowledge, I don't think there's any work going on there thinking about turning that around and going the other way. So I think there's going to be some additional infrastructure opportunities around crude exports out of the U.S. in the next couple of years, particularly as we see Permian, light sweet ramping up, and all that's going to hit on the Gulf Coast.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Greg. Thanks, Tim.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Take care.","Operator","Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research is on line with a question. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, everyone, and welcome to Jeff. Greg, excellent decision to hire a sell-side oil analyst that you wildly overpaid. If we could ask you a long-term strategy question, Greg, we know your view on Refining, I'm certain, that hasn't changed. When we think beyond the major projects stuff over the next year, where do you think the growth in the business \u2013 what's your view of how you will generate growth? Is it going to be a second major project that's been alluded to on this call? Thanks.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes, I think there will be certainly opportunities. You're starting to see the second wave of crackers being planned in the U.S. and, certainly, we think that the feedstock will be there for another additional wave of crackers and we want to be in that lineup ultimately with CPChem. I think there will be continued opportunity for infrastructure around the crude and the product side, so I think Midstream will certainly continue to be a growth vehicle for us and we'll continue to use the master limited partnership to help fund that and be a part of that growth as we move forward.","I think in Refining, I think Refining is a good business. It's just, long-term, I just don't see it growing. I think that we've seen some decent gasoline demand growth over the last two years in the U.S. but, ultimately, I think there's just too many factors that are going to hit you in terms of efficiencies of vehicles, trending in terms of vehicle ownership in the U.S. and how we do that.","So I actually think demand rolls at some point in the next couple of years in the U.S. and that we're going to need less transportation fuels. So I think exports are a really important part of that, that equation, and you see us, and many others, gearing up to try to handle that as we think a little differently about where our markets are going to be in the future. But really to invest in refining to add capacity still doesn't make sense to us. I think to invest to reduce your cost structure, gain access to advantaged crudes and grew some yields, those are all good investments that we should be making and what you will see us continue to do that around refining.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, that was actually where this all had started, where you finished, Greg, which is the export story., U.S. exports on every level are way exceeding overall market growth. Where are we taking market share? I know part of it is poor refining operations in certain parts of the world, but I just wonder how we should think about the long-term potential of the market when we must be making someone lose out somewhere, right?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yeah, Paul, it's Tim. I think when you think about the Gulf Coast with the types of assets there are with access both inbound, outbound on product and crude is going to be really the place where you see the exports. That puts you naturally into Latin America. And you're right, there has been operating issues within that. But we're also competing directly, if you will, then with the European refineries. And I think with the cost position that we have, the proximity to the market, I think that's where we continue to see it.","And then West Africa continues to be a developing market and growing that the Atlantic Basin and the Gulf Coast will continue to serve. It's just a question of how much can those grow and who supplies the Asian demand? But we still feel, to us, like, the Middle East and Northeast Asia are still going to be the big suppliers into Asia. That's quite a haul from the U.S, and so I think, logically, the trade patterns start to sort out that the export markets for the U.S. will likely largely be in that Atlantic Basin.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","The other thing, just not long-term, Paul, but maybe near-term, mid-term, kind of 2018, certainly 2017, we see less refining capacity coming on globally than what we've seen in the past few years. I think in our balances, we have about 800 (44:15) a day coming on in 2017 and 2018.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. It's interesting because ever since the export trend started, it's been surprising us to the upside, and I'm slightly struggling to know how far it can go. It's obviously outright positive for you guys. Just if I could ask a follow-up. You've had a bit stronger Chemicals results than some of the other results you've seen, perhaps Dow and Exxon, would be what I'm thinking of here. Was there anything particularly differentiated about why your results were that bit better in terms of relative to your competitors? Thanks.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","I think first of all, the demand regardless of chemicals, we think about aromatics and plastics, it's all been really strong and so I think we were obviously benefiting; the industry did from a really good market condition. And then it comes back to, Paul, your advantage feedstock will be produced in the Middle East, will be produced in North America off of that. So we continue to have an advantage feedstock.","And then fourth quarter results were probably weaker than we would've expected so the quarter-on- quarter improvement sequentially somewhat reflected better operating, less turnaround activities, et cetera, but then fundamentally, margins were better and that's really about how you capture those, you have got to have access to markets and you like to work on that competitive advantage on the feedstock. And so I think those two showed up.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes, we saw good strength though, in both ethylene and polyethylene. We saw good strength coming off our Middle East joint ventures, our aromatics business did much better quarter over quarter. And then I think the other thing is kind of lost in the conversation maybe as we had quite a bit of turnaround activity at CPChem. So again your 33, (46:00) which is a large ethylene cracker; Sweeny was down for most of the quarter. Q-Chem I was down for turnaround, M-Sty (46:08) had a big turnaround, and so in spite of pretty substantial turnaround activity at CPChem, they had a really solid quarter.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch is online with the question. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. It's still morning here. Good morning, everybody. Jeff, we are going to hit you around the holes over here. Congratulations on your move.","Jeff Dietert - Phillips 66","Thank you Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So I'm not sure if this is for Kevin or Greg, but last quarter I think, Greg, you talked about having $500 million to $750 million of discretionary capital budget. I'm trying to wrap everything together in your comments about softer refining, or I guess similar to last year , and then the trend, the cash burn trend, and then all the visibility of the dropdowns that you have. So there's a lot of flexibility.","But then I'm looking at the trend in net debt to cap for your balance sheet. Where do you want that balance sheet to be? And how long do you think you can extend the buybacks beyond your commitments to 2017? I think you talked about a couple billion dollars for this year.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes, so maybe start with CapEx. I think we've said $500 million to $700 million of flexibility in capital this year in 2017 that we've built into the plan. Obviously the further you get into the year, the harder it is to adjust that as we FID projects and kind of move forward. And I think we'll continue to look at where margins are and save some ability to adjust capital, certainly through midyear, let's say, Doug.","We continue to think about the business on mid-cycle basis. We should generate $4 billion to $5 billion of cash kind of mid-cycle. We still expect that we'll be able to generate $2 billion out of the MLP through drops. And with that we can certainly afford $1 billion of sustained capital, $1.3 billion dividend, growing that dividend.","And then you think about we have a choice. Do we buy shares, do we reinvest in the business? I think you can certainly afford kind of a $1 billion to $2 billion growth program and a $1 billion to $2 billion share repurchase program. And so that's kind of how we think about the business.","I think the first quarter certainly \u2013 I probably wouldn't use the word cash burn in terms of that. I think we certainly plan to bring cash down to this level given all the things that we had going on. We did not have a drop in the first quarter. And you certainly \u2013 as we move through 2017, you expect that we're going to do something around growing PSXP.","You were at $630-ish million dollars run rate EBITDA. We're committing to get to $1.1 billion run rate by the end of 2018. And so in this year and next year we're going to have to be moving directionally to do that.","So I think we can make it all balance in terms of a strong share repurchase program, strong dividend program, and continue to fund both our sustaining and growth CapEx.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, Greg, I guess what I was getting at is looking at the trend, the slide 17 trend, is there a kind of a range that you would have us expect your balance sheet to live within over time? Not necessarily this year but longer-term, where would we expect your balance sheet to sit through the cycle?","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes. I think we'll continue to target 20% to 30% debt-to-cap. And of course we're at the upper end of that range today. I think, Kevin, you may want to talk about the debt and the restructuring of the debt and an ability to draw up an MLP. But you should expect that we'll pull PSX debt down and that you'll see the debt at PSXP grow.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yes. I think that's an important point, Doug, that as you \u2013 with the growth of the MLP, debt will increase at the MLP. That's going to happen. And our expectation is that over time \u2013 and it may not be a perfect match, but generally at the PSX level debt will come down so that such \u2013 that on a consolidated basis we're staying about flat.","We just recently issued about $1.5 billion of short-term debt. That is pre-funding for a maturity. We have a $1.5 billion maturity that will be taken care of next week. That is all at the PSX level, but we've structure that debt in such a way that we can move it down into the MLP with \u2013 as part of a drop-down transaction. And that way you're kind of far funding the drop by moving debt from the parent company into the MLP. And so we're managing leverage that way.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That was extremely helpful. I appreciate the full answer, guys. My follow up maybe is a quick one, maybe not. But I wanted to go back to one of the operating result on refining. Versus our numbers at least it was particularly strong in the Gulf Coast.","And what's really behind my question is I'm trying to understand is there anything unusual about this particular quarter that caused that. And I guess one of the earlier questions was alluding to the RIN issue.","So I realize, Kevin, you were pretty assertive in your answer to this. But there still seems to be a debate as to whether RINs are in the crack or not. And obviously as it relates to things like moving the point of obligation and so on, I'm just curious if the collapse in RIN prices in Q1 was one of the reasons that refining did a little bit better. And maybe if you've answered the question already, I apologize, but I just wanted to get some clarity around that.","Kevin J. Mitchell - Phillips 66","Yes, certainly. The reduction in the RIN cost is a component on the improved \u2013 it really shows up in capture, right, the improvement in the capture rate, which was pretty significant for us, especially on the Gulf Coast. The other component which I touched on are some of those other clean products. And I don't know how sustainable that is. There's always some degree of benefit from those sort of chemical grade products.","But you saw a spike in the relative margin on those products, and so that was part of it as well. And that benefit was concentrated in the Gulf Coast also.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yes. Maybe just a comment on the chemicals piece. So that's really aromatics out of Alliance. It's solvents and cyclohexane for instance out of Sweeny. So we have pretty good exposure on those two refineries into that. And the strength in the chemicals business was evident really across that.","So I think as we think about the chemicals business, we believe that in the aromatics and the solvents businesses, that strength is going to continue.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That was really my follow up, was so that has continued so far both on the RIN side and on the derivative petrochemical side. They're both \u2013 those two trends have continued into Q2 so far?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yes. So far it's positive. There's obviously volatility in those chemical prices. But when you look back at the results across the various value chains in chemicals, feels like a pretty good pull on all those. And then, you're right, the RINs prices being lower does impact and improve the capture rate.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Really helpful.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Yes. We continue to believe that the RIN is essentially captured in the crack, though. I think it's hard to see sometimes, but I think our view is that it is.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yes. I think we're kind of in between. We actually believe it's in the crack largely. And we also believe there's an element at that that you see in the market side as well. But largely to us, we think it's in the market crack.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answers, guys. Thanks so much.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets is online with a question. Your line is open.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, everyone. I was wondering if we could dig into the Frac Two potential FID that you mentioned for later this year. So obviously Frac One hasn't contributed, I think, the EBITDA that you had anticipated. So what gives the confidence to potentially FID it later? Is it just that the economies of scale are so overwhelmingly attractive there?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yes, I think the next tranche of capital investment will be lower, which is always a good thing from a project standpoint. Second of all, the first frac in terms of the frac fees I think are \u2013 is still a very attractive piece. And now we're leveraging lower CapEx, improve that, and now we're able to run it closer to that design capacity which impacts things as well.","And for us, a second frac based on NGL helps us with our costs around the export terminal and some other things. So as we build out more, you actually start to leverage up across that entire hub in terms of incremental EBITDA and in terms of improved cost. And again, we're still looking long-term and saying, this is what's needed from an industry standpoint, and it ties back with things like what we're doing with Sand Hills to expand its capacity. We're just seeing increased NGL needed eventually for more cracks as ethane comes back into the mix more out of rejection, and then that's stronger than we see in exports.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Understood. And then I guess kind of along the same lines, I was wondering if we could talk about something that hasn't been brought up in a couple of years I think, which is the condensate splitter. I think in maybe in 2014, that was something that seemed like it might make sense for you guys. Is there any chance that that project comes back to life? And I'm thinking particularly about how light some of these Delaware Basin crudes are.","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yes, well, I think we have to see that supply, but we're watching that. And some of those gravities that we're seeing around that 50 degree mark \u2013 that kind of revives that whole discussion I think around what exactly would be produced. And so I think that that's one where you've got to see the supply come in before you would get on that path.","But it will be interesting to see if the Permian comes back in that light fraction, if there's sufficient volumes there to really say that the best way to manage that is a splitter versus blending or direct export. So that's just an option that we're watching. So nothing planned right now, but it \u2013 it's one that we are aware of and thinking about.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil is online with a question. Your line is open.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Folks, good morning. Jeff, I would also congratulate you for escaping the purgatory of energy sell-side these days. I just wanted to revisit a couple of items that came up. Beaumont, I realize, we're expanding the storage capacity and the opportunity to export. Is that oil export arb open today? I'm just wondering, are you maxing out your capability there, or is this really a kind of second half of the year event once all of the pipelines are up and running and bringing crude down?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Well, as an industry, you've certainly seen it, and those differentials drive that. And what we're seeing is \u2013 I'll frame it this way. We're seeing a lot of interest in the storage to be able to create that option. And so we have done oil exports out of Beaumont already in this year, and so I think we look at it and say as long as those new pipelines get connected, the volumes are coming via from North Dakota, the Mid-Con and the Permian, et cetera, then that will continue to build.","So I think right now, you see it very volatile as those differentials come in and out of play. But longer-term, if you believe light oil production is going to increase, we're just \u2013 we see that as a continuing need.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Right. Okay.","Greg C. Garland - Phillips 66","I think \u2013 just tactically, I think once you see that WTI-Brent get above $2.50 a barrel, people get a lot more interested in exporting.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Sure, okay. Tim, I think earlier you had mentioned Canadian outages, and my question is pretty simple. Just into 2Q with the outage or syncrude, are you seeing any meaningful impact on the system whether it be direct or indirect?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Well, we've obviously \u2013 the availability has caused us to look at other crudes to run. We've not seen a problem from a supply standpoint. There's plenty of crude options available. But it does cause us to re-jigger across some of our system because we are not bringing down as much Canadian crude as we were. And so I think from our viewpoint, operationally, it's been a minimal impact, but it has created different options for us around the system.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Right. So think about it more in terms of capture rate, I suppose, like paying out for crude rather than lack of surplus, I suppose?","Timothy Garth Taylor - Phillips 66","Yes. We go back to the economic optimization of what's the best thing to run.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.

Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $1.4 billion, or $3.11 per share. We generated $1.7 billion of operating cash flow. We continue to operate safely and reliably, successfully executing our strategy and delivering another quarter of strong performance. Midstream achieved record adjusted earnings in its transportation and NGL businesses and continued to progress its portfolio of growth projects.","We captured favorable margins in our Refining and Marketing businesses. CPChem also operated well and contributed to our strong cash generation. During the quarter, we distributed $841 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We recently announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program further demonstrating our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. ","Disciplined capital allocation is fundamental to our strategy, and it creates value for our shareholders. Over the long-term, we will reinvest 60% of our operating cash flow back into the business and return 40% to our shareholders, through dividends and share repurchases. We're dedicated to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We buy back our shares when they trade below intrinsic value. We're buying shares today.","During the quarter we advanced our portfolio of Midstream growth projects. These projects will contribute to future earnings growth, creating additional value for our shareholders. Phillips 66 Partners has started line fill and commissioning activities on the Gray Oak Pipeline. The 900,000 barrel per day pipeline will transport crude oil from the Permian and the Eagle Ford to the Texas Gulf Coast, including our Sweeny refinery. We expect to begin initial service in November and anticipate full service in the first quarter of 2020. Phillips 66 Partners owns a 42.25% interest in the joint venture. Gray Oak Pipeline will connect with multiple refineries and export facilities in the Corpus Christi area, including the South Texas Gateway Terminal, in which PSXP has a 25% ownership. The terminal will have two deepwater marine docks, over 7 million barrels of storage capacity, and up to 800,000 barrels per day of throughput capacity. The terminal is expected to start out in mid 2020. ","The Liberty Pipeline will provide transportation from the growing Rockies and Bakken production areas to Cushing, Oklahoma. Liberty will have access to the Gulf Coast via the Red Oak Pipeline. We own a 50% interest and will construct and operate Liberty. The Red Oak Pipeline system will connect Cushing and the Permian Basin to multiple locations along the Gulf Coast, including Corpus Christi, Ingleside, Houston and Beaumont. We own a 50% interest and will operate Red Oak. The Liberty and Red Oak pipelines are backed by long-term volume commitments and are targeted to begin initial service in the first half of 2021. ","With these new pipelines, along with our existing crude system, this positions us to serve the key shale oil producing regions and provides connectivity to major Gulf Coast market centers. We are adding three fractionators to the Sweeny Hub, each with a capacity of 150,000 barrels per day. Fracs 2 and 3 are on track to start up in the fourth quarter of 2020. The recently sanctioned Frac 4 is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021. The fracs are backed by customer commitments. Upon completion of Frac 4 the Sweeny Hub will have 550,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity. ","In connection with our expansion at the Sweeny Hub, PSXP is increasing storage capacity at Clemens Caverns from 9 million barrels to 15 million barrels. The project is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. ","Also at the Sweeny Hub, PSXP is constructing the C2G pipeline, 16 inch ethane pipeline from Clemens Caverns to the petrochemical customers in the Corpus Christi area. The pipeline will have 240,000 barrels per day of capacity and is expected to be complete in mid 2021. ","In Chemicals, CPChem is expanding its strategic partnership with Qatar petroleum to develop petrochemical assets in the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Qatar. Pending final investment decisions, these world scale projects will add ethylene and high density polyethylene capacity at advantaged feedstock locations. This further enhances CPChem\u2019s leading polyethylene position to supply the world's growing demand for polymers. ","At the Lake Charles refinery, we started up Phillips 66 Partners 25,000 barrels per day isomerization unit, increasing our production of higher octane gasoline blend components. ","At the Sweeny refinery, we\u2019re upgrading the FCC to increase production of higher value petrochemical feedstock and higher octane gasoline. This project is on track to complete in the second quarter of 2020.","So before I turn the call over to Kevin. I would like to invite you to join us on November 6th for our Investor Day in New York City. Look forward to providing an update on our strategy, how we're positioned to deliver superior returns to our shareholders. You'll see members from our management team, and they'll each discuss their businesses, including projects we\u2019re executing to grow Midstream and Chemicals as well as improved returns in Refining and Marketing. ","With that, Kevin will take us through the financial results. ","Kevin Mitchell ","Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our financial results. Third quarter earnings were $712 million. We had special items that netted to an after-tax loss of $690 million, mostly due to an impairment of our DCP Midstream investment, reflecting continued deterioration of the DCP unit price and lower GP valuations. After excluding special items, adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion or $3.11 per share. Operating cash flow was $1.8 billion excluding working capital impact. Capital spending for the quarter was $867 million, including $569 million on growth projects. ","We returned $841 million to shareholders through $402 million of dividends and $439 million of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 444 million shares outstanding. ","Moving to Slide 5. This slide highlights the change in pre-tax income by segment from the second quarter to the third quarter. Adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion were up slightly from the prior quarter. Increased results in Marketing and Specialties were offset by lower earnings in Refining. The third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21%. ","Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. Third quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $440 million, an increase of $70 million from the previous quarter. This quarter we achieved record adjusted pre-tax income in the transportation and NGL businesses. Transportation adjusted pre-tax income was $248 million up $3 million from the previous quarter due to higher pipeline volumes. ","NGL and other adjusted pre-tax income increased $26 million, driven by improved butane and propane trading activity. At the Sweeny Hub, the export facility averaged 11 cargoes a month and the fractionator ran at 108% utilization. ","The Lake Charles isomerization unit reached full production in September, and the initial operating performance is in line with expectations. ","DCP Midstream adjusted pre-tax income of $23 million was down $12 million from the previous quarter due to hedging impacts. During the quarter, the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline in which DCP had a 25% interest began commercial operations. The pipeline transports approximately 2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from the Permian to Gulf Coast markets. ","Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Third quarter adjusted pre-tax income for the segment, which $269 million, $6 million lower than the second quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pre-tax income was $251 million down $9 million from the previous quarter. The decrease reflects low margins partially offset by higher polyethylene sales volumes. Global O&P utilization was 97%. ","Adjusted pre-tax income for SA&S increased $2 million. During the third quarter we received approximately $300 million in cash distributions from CPChem. ","Next on Slide 8 we'll cover Refining. The third quarter crude utilization rate was 97% and clean product yield was 84%, both consistent with the prior quarter. Turnaround costs were $120 million, up from $67 million in the second quarter. In addition, our share of WRB turnaround expenses amounted to $46 million. Refining third quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $839 million, down $144 million from last quarter. The chart provides a reasonable view of the change from the prior period. The decrease was driven largely by the Central Corridor.","Atlantic Basin adjusted pre-tax income improved $21 million, due to the higher distillate crack partially offset by lower volumes. In the Gulf Coast the decrease was driven by turnaround costs and lower margins from narrowing WTI LLS crude differentials. In the Central Corridor, the decrease was mainly due to a decline in the market crack that was partially offset by widening WCS differentials. Additionally, there were higher turnaround costs at WRB. In the West Coast, the decrease was driven by turnaround costs.","Side 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the third quarter was $14.60 per barrel, compared to $15.24 per barrel in the second quarter. Our realized margin was $11.18 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 77%. Market capture was impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We make less gasoline and more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. ","During the quarter, the distillate crack increased 6% and the gasoline crack decreased 11%. Losses from secondary products of $1.07 per barrel improved $0.28 per barrel from the previous quarter due to increased butane blending into gasoline. Our feedstock advantage of $0.03 per barrel was in line with the prior quarter as the impact from widening Canadian crude differentials was offset by narrowing Gulf Coast differentials.","The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. The other category reduced realized margins by $0.38 per barrel. ","Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted third quarter pre-tax income was $498 million, $145 million higher than the second quarter. Marketing and Other increased $146 million from higher margins. During the quarter, we were able to optimize product supply across our integrated logistics network in multiple regions to capture favorable market conditions. Specialties was in line with the prior quarter. We reimaged approximately 400 domestic branded sites during the third quarter, bringing the total to approximately 3,700 since the start of the program. Refined product exports in the third quarter were 220,000 barrels per day. ","On Slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pre-tax costs of $178 million, improved $27 million from the prior quarter. Lower net interest expense was due to increased capitalized interest. The decrease in corporate overhead costs was primarily due to lower environmental expenses. ","Slide 12 shows the change in cash during the quarter. We started the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Cash from operations was $1.8 billion excluding working capital. There was a slight working capital use primarily from inventory associated with cargoes and transit at quarter end. PSXP issued $900 million of unsecured notes and a portion of the proceeds were used to repay the remaining $400 million expanding under a term loan facility.","During the quarter, we funded $867 million of capital spending and returned $841 million to shareholders through $402 million of dividends and $439 million of share repurchases. Our ending cash balance was $2.3 billion. In October, Phillips 66 Partners also repaid $300 million of senior notes due February 2020. ","This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items for the fourth quarter. In Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the fourth quarter crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and pre-tax turnaround expenses to be between $170 million and $200 million. We anticipate corporate and other costs to come in between $210 and $230 million pre-tax. One additional item is not reflected on the slide, we expect 2019 adjusted capital spend to come in between $3.3 billion and $3.6 billion. This is broadly consistent with prior guidance and we look forward to providing you more detail on our capital program at the upcoming Investor Day. ","With that, we'll now open the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open. ","Doug Terreson ","So during the past three or four years, profits and return on capital in Refining and really Midstream do seem to have been stronger at Philips 66 and most of the peers, on this point I want to see why you think that's been the case. Meaning do you think it's because one; you have competitive advantage in the operational financial or strategic rooms. Or two, does it start with better governance and specifically that you\u2019re one of the few energy companies in which management performance is benchmarked against the overall market rather than only against energy peers which obviously is a lower bar, so broad array of potential reasons for the outperformance but just want to see why you guys think outperformance seems to have recur or be sustained at Phillips 66? ","Greg Garland","First of all, I think we have a great set of integrated assets. And we've been thoughtful about how we invest around the assets and we've been careful in our refining business to pursue investments that are certainly high return, quick payout investments with access to advantage crude or yield structure. In Midstream, we've leveraged our investments around our existing infrastructure, around, our Refining footprint as we create more value by doing that at the end of the day. I think our Chemicals business is differentiating. I mean, think about the chem's business, when we think about our competitors and who we compare ourselves to we have a pretty broad peer group, we're looking at peers in Midstream and Refining and Chemicals, we also look at our performance versus the S&P 100. And so we're looking at that on a total shareholder return basis but we also -- half of our long-term comp is return on capital employed, return still matter, Doug as you know, you're the teacher of us for that. So we're always watching the returns and we're investing. And then as you think about, we've returned $25 billion back to our investors over this period of time. We know that a strong competitive, secured, growing then is important to people and we know that buying our shares back when we trade below intrinsic value creates value. And that would be brilliant. ","Doug Terreson ","Yes, impressive results over the years that speak for themselves. I had another question too. And this is about Refining and specifically we're getting obviously closer to crunch time on IMO 2020 and just so I just wanted to get your updated views on the -- your market outlook for spreads between compliant, non-compliant fields and also light-heavy differentials, how you guys are thinking about that as we get closer to the goal line? ","Greg Garland ","Hey, Kevin?","Kevin Mitchell ","Yes, I think we\u2019re continuing to watch. We've consistently talked about the forward curve, not because it's an accurate predictor but because it's an indication of where consensus views are or at least some people are willing to trade. And we have seen the Cal 20 market move wider on distillate cracks, the 10-year average distillate crack versus Brent is about $13 a barrel. Cal 20 is out about $18 a barrel. So that has strengthened as we've moved closer to the implementation date. Similarly for high sulfur fuel oil discounts the 10-year average is about $12 below Brent and the Cal 20 is currently at $24 a barrel wider. We've seen high sulfur fuel oil discount start to widen as we've moved towards implementation and for refineries that continue to produce high sulfur fuel. There is a rapidly declining market for that product. So those discounts are starting to widen out and we think we'll see above mid cycle margins as we look into 2020 driven by this IMO impact. ","Operator","Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open. ","Neil Mehta ","If I want to kick off on marketing, particularly strong set of earnings there relative to I think street expectations. How much of that was the market environment with crude coming down versus something sustainable and ratable that you can kind of pull forward? Can you just talk about how you think about the outlook for that business and its strength? ","Kevin Mitchell","Neil, let me address that for you. So as you think about the third quarter in our marketing business, it's usually a stronger quarter probably seasonally on average is probably the best quarter anyway and you combine that with the fact that you had the right set up in terms of the movement in prices as you went through the quarter, certainly until you got to the very short-lived price spike that happened later in the quarter with the Saudi strikes. And so you had that environment. And then we also had the situation of -- at various locations around the country where you had sort of product supply, issues are upsets that we were able to leverage the network we have in place to move product into market and capture those opportunities as they were. So there is certainly an element of what we saw in the third quarter that I wouldn't consider just normal ratable roll that forward. It probably amounts to a reasonable portion of the increase. When you look at the sequential quarter-over-quarter increase, we were up $145 million or so. And so it's a reasonable portion of that, but certainly not all of it. ","Neil Mehta ","The other place is Chemicals which again outperformed our model and it felt more like throughput versus margin but given the weakness in global chemicals margins, any comments about the resilience that you've earnings there? And then the outlook for commodity chemicals would be helpful, too? ","Jeff Dietert","You're right, Neil. The margin didn't do anything to help us in the third quarter. We actually were off slightly on margins relative to the prior quarter but we made up that on volumes and I think we had -- CPChem had record polyethylene sales volumes and that was a combination of strong operations, high utilization and I think a little bit of sales out of inventory as well contributed to that. But fundamentally right now it's still a relatively weak margin environment where CPChem is able to do well is really a portfolio factor in terms of if you look at the assets they have, the feedstocks where they're positioned globally, they continue to perform very well on a competitive basis relative to the others in their space. ","Greg Garland ","I think as we look at the outlook, we continue to see a robust outlook for ethane supply. Ethane rejection, we're estimating over 1 million barrels a day, it continues to grow. So very strong ethane availability and we're seeing increase in pipeline capacity, new fractionators coming online that creates a positive outlook for ethane supply going forward. We continue to expect to see polyethylene demand grow at a faster pace than global GDP growth. We have seen some softness in the immediate term. You'll see the IHS polythene margin in our release was $0.23 and change for 3Q, it's down $0.19 to $0.20 in October. So a little bit of continuing softness there. ","Operator","Paul Cheng from Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead, your line is open. ","Paul Cheng ","A couple of quick questions, just that given the varied economics, how much is high sulfur resid or the resid component? You may be able to recycle through your Refinery as a fit to you coker, have you test it to see whether it worked for you? And does it make any difference whether that you are using delayed coker or fluid coker technology? ","Jeff Dietert","Yes. So we have seen with the further discounts are or the rapid discounts in high sulfur fuel oil and other heavy intermediates, an opportunity to increase utilization in a number of our refineries. They're relatively small volumes, 1,000 to 5,000 barrels a day here and there, depending on the refinery across our portfolio. As you know, we do have substantial coking capacity to upgrade these streams and expect to benefit from these discounts. Logistics provide a meaningful limiting factor as bringing in large volumes of high sulfur fuel oil or other intermediates, requires infrastructure pipeline capacity, storage capable of managing these streams. And so I think that\u2019s a limiting factor. As we go forward, high sulfur fuel oil has weakened substantially and for the refiners that are producers of high sulfur fuel oil, that's going to be a headwind for capacity utilization. We expect some economic run cuts and stress on refineries that don't have the cokers to process this high sulfur fuel oil and so we expect those refineries to run at lower utilization rates for the high sulfur fuel oil to result in wider discounts for heavy high sulfur crudes. And so we expect those differentials to widen out and see a benefit from high sulfur fuel flowing through to wider discounts on crudes. And we're starting to see that in the marketplace with a little bit of a lag. ","Paul Cheng ","Jeff, do you have a number that you guys will be willing to share in terms of what's the technicality and taking into consideration or the logistic limitation that you can run, what economic is here? ","Jeff Dietert","Well, I think logistics are going to be a big restricting factor and that the many plants are not set up to bring in large volumes of heavy intermediates. ","Paul Cheng ","On the Gray Oak, the initial start-up in November. Do you have a capacity that you can share with us before that the full startup and also whether that is just going to Corpus Christi and whether there\u2019s any extension beyond that when that's going to happen? And what is the Corpus Christi current core export capacity you guys will estimate at? ","Jeff Dietert","Yes. So I think as you know we are ramping up Gray Oak later this quarter and then in the first quarter, it will probably have full impact by late first quarter, second quarter timeframe. Our South Texas gateway facility is scheduled for a mid-summer start up. As you look at industry-wide, Corpus Christi exports had been running about 600,000 barrels a day with the startup of Cactus and Epic pipelines. We saw that rapidly increase to 1.2 million barrels a day and that's actually the maximum throughput that we've seen so far from the facilities in Corpus Christi. Theoretically there is about 1.7 million barrels a day of potential capacity but it's not clear that all of that can run at really high utilization rates. So I think we'll see Corpus Christi continue to increase and probably take market share from other export facilities across the Gulf, especially for Permian barrels. And so it may be tight here until the back half of 2020 when there is more export capacity available in Corpus. ","Greg Garland ","The other thing, Paul, the early service is obviously going to the Corpus area but producers will be able to hop on the Kinder system and get the Houston if they so choose to do that. ","Operator","Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open. ","Phil Gresh ","First question is just with the impact we've seen on freight rates and availability. I'm curious if you see any potential impact to crude differentials as a result of this moving forward or just in general how do you think it will impact refineries and product markets and crude markets? Thanks. ","Jeff Dietert ","I think we are seeing those wider tanker rates prior to some of these implications, you could ship Gulf Coast to Asia VLCC rates around 350 a barrel. That was as recently as September. They jumped to $10 a barrel earlier this month and have recently come back in around $6 a barrel. The sanctioning of China's COSCO Shipping Company has had a big influence on that, vessels linked to Venezuela inflows are factor, longer sales times due to the Chinese tariffs are having an influence as well. There are a number of ships that are in dockyards currently with scrubbers being added. And then as we think about IMO influences, they're going to be slight changes that we think are going to result in longer routes as well. So you've got a mix of short-term factors intermediate-term factors, and I think some long-term factors that are contributing to steeper shipping cost. As we look at this, it looks to us as though particularly Brent WTI and really it's the Gulf Coast to Brent spread that is likely to be impacted wider requirements for Houston to Brent spread. So we expect that will widen a WTI a bit, perhaps reduced some US imports short-term. We're also seeing long-haul importers in Asia in particular that are being impacted by the higher tanker rates. Many of these refineries are responsible for the tanker portion, the tanker expenses there. And so we've seen reports of run cuts in Asia that will take some product out of the market. So I think those are probably the major influences. ","Greg Garland ","On balance, we view it's positive for the PSX portfolio though. ","Jeff Dietert ","And I think as we look at our portfolio, we are dealing mainly in short-term spot movements and would expect -- we don't see it influencing our market capture at this point. ","Phil Gresh ","And second question, I think I'll just stick to a cash flow question in the quarter rather than the strategic that will be discussed at the Analyst Day. So, Kevin, with the cash flows in the quarter, it looks like there is a flip on deferred taxes there working capital was a headwind. I think you are expecting to be a tailwind in the back half, so just any quick updates you would have there? And if you could I know you gave the 2019 CapEx in the past, I think you've given 2020. Is there any refresher on that? Thanks. ","Kevin Mitchell ","Let me hit the deferred taxes first. So we had a slight -- we had an adjustment on deferred tax this quarter because of the DCP impairment. So that impairment flows through the income statement and is tax affected on the income statement. From a tax standpoint, there is no change in basis and so I could suggest that back out in deferred taxes so you can give 900 million pre-tax impairment. It's about $200 million of deferred tax impact there. So our year-to-date deferred taxes of $115 million if you normalize for that DCP item would be around about $300 million which is about exactly where we'd expect it to be. Our guidance for the year is $400 million. ","In terms of the broader working capital position, I think I did talk to the slight use of cash in the third quarter related to inventories on the water. As you look at the full year, we would expect that the majority of the working capital use that we've recorded to-date so full year working capital has been a use of cash, $1.3 billion. We'd expect the majority of that to come back in the fourth quarter which reflects our sort of normal seasonal trend as we build inventories at the beginning of the year and bring them back down later in the year. So that's where we\u2019d expect to be on that. And then in terms of capital we will defer that to the Investor Day. ","Operator","Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open. ","Roger Read ","Just wanted to follow-up, I think maybe on the Midstream part of the business. I guess a couple of questions here. One, have you given any clarity as to what assets were affected by the DCP write-off? And then I'll just go ahead and kind of list them out here and you can take them as you want. With the new pipelines coming on both from West Texas through to Eagle Ford to Corpus and then from Cushing down to Houston, do you run any risk of sort of cannibalizing some of the other ops you have going on? I'm thinking about Beaumont specifically and maybe give us an idea of how that's affected? And then my final question in the Midstream area, as you look at the frac unit that ran above capacity here, we think about the capacity growth to a little over 0.5 million barrels a day by I believe 2021. Should we think about any limitations on capacity -- running above capacity out in 2021 from dock capacity issues at Sweeny? ","Jeff Dietert ","I might take the Beaumont question and let Kevin do DCP. With Beaumont, we see substantial Mid-Continent barrels coming into the Beaumont facility, be it from Cushing, be it from the Bakken pipeline and we see that as an excellent option for exporting -- storing, exporting, reaching other facilities in the Houston area. Obviously, we also have Bayou Bridge that moves into Lake Charles and provides an advantage for crude feedstock advantage for Lake Charles and ultimately potentially the ACE Pipeline down to Alliance. So, I see Beaumont being a very strong option for Mid-Continent barrels whereas at Corpus Christi it's the lowest transportation cost option from the Permian Basin to get to the water and advantages at Corpus Christi with lower fog days and much less congestion there relative to other options. So I think Corpus is substantially advantage relative to Permian barrels. As you think about our Liberty and Red Oak pipelines coming in and the flexibility that Red Oak has to deliver to Corpus to Eagle side, to Houston, to our Sweeny Refinery over to Beaumont, the flexibility of hitting all those export facilities is a substantial advantage that I think was a big reason why shippers were willing to commit to it relative to other pipeline options. ","Kevin Mitchell ","And then on DCP. So there were two elements to the impairment write-down, although the bulk of it all relates to our impairment of our investment in DCP. So there was a small component which was a DCP level asset impairment which included impairing some goodwill, that's relatively small out of the $900 million in aggregate. That's about 45 million of that flow through to our financials. The bulk of the reduction related to us impairing our investment in DCP. So that's not specific to any one asset but it's looking at the carrying value that we have on the balance sheet for our investment in DCP relative to fair value and the fair value calculation is dominated by the DCP unit price. We\u2019ve highlighted this in our 2Q 10-Q that we had a potential impairment that we considered may be temporary at that point in time. But given that the unit price continued to deteriorate over the third quarter, it was appropriate to take the impairment in this quarter. ","Jeff Dietert ","Last question was around the fracs, 550,000 barrels a day and kind of 35%, 38% yield of propane, that\u2019s 200,000 barrels a day. So it will be imbalance between our LPG export capacity and our fractionation capacity. ","Operator","Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Doug Leggate ","I don't want to get too much ahead of what you might say in a couple of weeks, Greg but I'm just curious as kind of a follow-up to Roger's question on the Midstream. Have you had any different thoughts about the ownership -- the right ownership structure for PSXP? I'm thinking specifically after the simplification you did with the IDRs, obviously your ownership is quite significant and the arbitrage of having a Midstream business, all the benefits that were there several years ago perhaps one could argue they're not as obvious today. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that? And I've got a follow-up, please. ","Greg Garland ","Upper point, the unit price has done nicely since the IDR transaction on PSXP, I think just straight-up cost of capital standpoint, probably still has a cost of capital advantage versus PSX and 5.5%, 6% yield on a some of parts basis. We're still advantaged to build our Midstream business in PSXP. So we'll continue to grow organically PSXP and as indeed as you've seen, we've done last couple of years 1 billion plus of kind of organic capital investments. We have a great growth portfolio. PSXP has great capacity to execute. So I think you'll see us continue along those same lines. ","Doug Leggate ","Okay, I appreciate taking the question I'll expect we will get more color at the Analyst Day. My follow-up is I kind of feel like if I ask this question, I don't know how often you're stock keeps rallying to new good levels but every time it does I kind of ask this question. Buybacks versus dividends, Greg, what's your latest thinking? Because obviously you\u2019ve been very -- I think my experience of watching you do this over the years is you've been quite sensitive to price changes in terms of when you step on accelerator and when you pull back. Your yield is obviously for good reasons, obviously is a little lower than it's been recently in quite some time and probably one of the lowest in the peer group now. So how are you thinking about the right balance between those two, especially as the underlying cash flow capacity of the business has got a pretty good growth trajectory over the next several years? Now I'll leave it there. Thanks. ","Greg Garland ","No, I always start kind of mid-cycle cash flow of $6.5 billion, Doug and we can afford $1 billion sustaining capital, $5 billion, $6 billion dividend and we can afford of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion of share repurchase, $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion of growth capital. Might be a healthy tension in there. So we start from the basis that we want the dividend to be competitive with certainly S&P 100 in our peer group, we look at that. I think we've had 25% compound annual dividend growth since our first dividend. So we've demonstrated a good track record of strong dividend growth. You expect that will continue for us. Certainly 1 billion, 5 billion, 6 billion is very affordable and $6.5 billion of cash flow, so we've got room to grow it. Now share repurchases, we\u2019re intrinsic value, we look at kind of mid-cycle earnings out of our business streams. We're looking one to two years out in our long-range plan and we're planning historical multiple that more trade below intrinsic value we're buying. We have a grid, we reset a grid every quarter. If the share price goes up we buy less and if share price goes down we buy more. And so that's the way we handle that. I think we're all in about $77.40 since in terms of our total share repurchases since inception. So given where the share price is trading today we're pretty happy with that. ","Operator","Prashant Rao from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Prashant Rao ","I don't mean to front run or anything that you'll say in a couple of weeks but do you have a question on longer term, the Midstream ramp and capital decisions, especially given how well the segment is performing. On a macro basis, there is concerns on U.S. oil production next year that are mounting, there is rig counts falling and we've had some concerns among investors on global demand growth and recession risk is still on some investors\u2019 mind. So should these factors materialize? I was wondering about the potential pressures that could put on intermediate demand for some of the longer-term Midstream projects in your queue? And maybe if you could talk about the levers at your disposal in terms of the capital commitments, deployments, I mean how you could protect and defend the consolidated sort of return on the growth portfolio on invested capital should there be impact? And thinking sort of, if I look at Liberty and maybe some of those projects that come on late 2020, early 2021? ","Greg Garland ","Well, so I'll start and then and Kevin and Jeff can kind of fill in the blank. So first of all, Gray Oak, Red Oak and Liberty are all backed by long-term customer commitments that extend well beyond the timeframe that you just mentioned. As I think about the U.S. upstream industry, I think we're going to move into a period of slowing growth in U.S. upstream. Actually, I think that's a good thing. I don't think we can continue to grow 1.6 million barrels a day in the U.S. against the world demand going at 1.1 million. I don't think that's particularly healthy for the industry and for us in all of our business segments we need a strong viable upstream business in the U.S. So just from a high-level standpoint, I don't view the slowing growth as negative in terms of the opportunity set. Jeff or Kevin, you want to hop-in on that? ","Prashant Rao ","And just one quick follow-up, on IMO 2020, are you marketing any of these newer VLSFO blends? And if so, one of the questions that we get is and there's been a lot of speculation around this is sort of engine compatibility along parameters like the viscosity and flash points, paraffinic values, how valid are these concerns? And sort of as a maybe a related question, between -- if you are doing VLSFO, is there any technical or operating preference between using like a straight run vacuum gas oil with sulfur or some blending or is that clearly determined by the economics of the commodity market? ","Jeff Dietert ","Yes, I think one of the advantages of having a technology center is that we have been able to test fuels for compatibility and we have taken advantage of that. We will be offering compliant fuels in the market and we've had the ability to test them. We suspect that early on that the shipping companies will prefer marine gas oil and as confidence builds in some of the low-sulfur VGOs that those will gain traction as well. Our industry blending fuels is kind of a core competency for Phillips 66 and I think for our industry in total. So we expect to move forward with the IMO as planned. ","Operator","Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Manav Gupta ","As you speak with the shippers and other suppliers, what's your sense of the level of compliance that we might get even before like Jan 1? I'm assuming you would like to test this out before you enter Jan month. So how do you think compliance will trend into the last two months of the year? ","Jeff Dietert ","Yes, I think we're in a transition period. We saw the converting other tanks to compliance fuels really starting in August and September. We are seeing interest in compliance deals now and would guess to maybe 15% of the fleet is experimenting with compliant fuels today. That's going to accelerate as we move into November and maybe it increases to 50% of the use of compliant fuels in the fleet. And then as you know, with a number of these voyages go in 30 to 45 days, if you're going to be compliant, when you arrive in January you're going to need to be compliant when you depart in late November or December. And we think 75% to 90% of the fleet will have switched in December. And so we'll start to get a good view of what this market starts to look like. We are seeing inventories build with 30 VLCCs reported with compliant fuel in Asia. And so this transition period, there is probably going to be some price volatility and it's going to take us a few months to work through this transition and we're expecting to be ready to go once full implementation hits in January. ","Manav Gupta ","That's great. Quick small follow-up, you have one of the highest diesel yields in the industry, but I'm just trying to understand are there any we quick hit projects which you can do, which will increase your distillate production in 2020? And same for LSFO, any small quick hit projects, which will allow you to make probably 20,000 or 30,000 barrels more of LSFO? ","Jeff Dietert ","Yes, we've got a number of small capital high return projects that will increase our diesel yield. Quite frankly with the industry trend towards diesel demand growing more rapidly than gasoline demand, these were projects that we had full intentions of implementing regardless of IMO but they will benefit from the shift in IMO. And what we think will be stronger demand and stronger diesel cracks going forward. It's about 25,000 barrels a day in total for our '19 and early 2020 projects. We also have some high sulfur fuel oil, hydro treater projects that are going to increase our ability to make low-sulfur fuel oil as well and those will be implemented early in 2020, late this year and early 2020. ","Operator","Justin Jenkins from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Justin Jenkins ","We\u2019re about to the top of the hour so I'll keep it to one. But I think the one topic we haven't discussed is California here today and obviously margins have normalized here recently but just curious on your outlook for that particular region and maybe some of the drivers of the margin volatility that we've seen over the past month and a half there? ","Jeff Dietert ","Yes, I think the fall is the typical season for planned maintenance and we've had some planned downtime that was planned months ago at San Francisco. That had some impact on 3Q and will have some impact on fourth quarter as well. We have delayed some maintenance due to the strong margins and just the heavy maintenance that was planned at some of our other refineries but we're probably close to the peak of maintenance on the West Coast and expect as facilities come on those margins will normalize as we go into November and December. ","Operator","Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Chris Sighinolfi ","A lot of has been asked and answered and I appreciate all the added color. I was hoping, Kevin, Roger touched on it but if we could just circle back quickly to the DCP write-down, I'm just trying to better understand some of the mechanics there. I guess if I look at the public LP value deterioration net to your interest versus the magnitude of the write-down, pace to a pretty sharp decline the GP value and I just think about the base $85 million GP payment. I'm calculating something around a 9 times multiple now. If I use September end for the LP stake, I guess, question one is, am I looking at that correctly? I am assuming I am. Does that suggest a cut in the GP payout or is there something else that led to the multiple compression there obviously coverage and growth differences with PSXP, but I know when you guys eliminate the IDR there last quarter it was your pricing at around 17 times? So anything you can help me on that front would be helpful. Thanks. ","Kevin Mitchell ","Yes, I think you're thinking about the impairment correctly. There is no assumptions of change in distribution or any of that around. This reflects sort of ongoing level of distributions that we've seen and so you've got the LP unit price drives a significant portion of the valuation but then you got the GP valuation and the GP valuation is also linked to the unit price because as the unit price declines then that LP multiple has come down and then that translates across to how you look at the GP multiple. And so when you combine all that together that\u2019s where we get to where we are, I'm not going to get into the details of exactly what multiples we've used but the unit price is a big determining factor across both the LP and the GP valuation. ","Chris Sighinolfi ","I guess one follow-up growth on that. Is your fair value estimation an independent PSX exercise or is this something you do in coordination with Enbridge? ","Kevin Mitchell ","No this is all PSX. This is based on our book value that we have for our investment in DCP and it's all driven by conventional sort of impairment analysis accounting methodology that drives how we look at that. ","Operator","Jason Gabelman from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Jason Gabelman","I just wanted to ask on the Midstream organic growth projects. You\u2019ve typically talked about those projects at EBITDA build multiple of 6 times to 8 times. I'm wondering if the pipeline projects that you've announced and that you've sanctioned over the past couple of years, if those fall within the range and if those have maybe landed at the top or bottom end of the range or any indication you can give us on the types of multiples you're seeing on those pipeline projects? Thanks. ","Jeff Dietert ","I would just stay with that 6 to 8 range. I think that's a good range to be thinking about for our Midstream projects across the board. ","Jason Gabelman ","Okay. And then if I could just ask on CapEx, it seems like it continue to drift higher this year and the implied spend for 4Q, I guess is $1.2 billion which looks like a big step higher from 3Q. So what's driving that move higher and why was the range moved higher once again? Thanks. ","Greg Garland ","Well, what the estimate and the range reflects is -- so several projects that are in flight now that were not part of the original capital budget, so that's the primary reason. Earlier in the year, we had signaled increase related to Gray Oak in addition. But the other element that creates a little bit of uncertainty into exactly where the final number lands is, several of the Midstream projects sit in joint ventures and the joint ventures, those capital programs are on a cash flow basis. And so we're also subject to the exact timing of when the cash flow hit which sometime it's not always easy to get that to precise. And so that's also one of the reasons why we've given it in a range that way because there is always some element of uncertainty as to where that goes. But bear in mind, we have a lot of projects that we're spending on right now between the -- you've got the fracs and Sweeney, the Gray Oak Pipeline, the Red Oak Pipeline, liberty, the C2G Pipeline. And so those are some of the larger projects and suite of smaller projects as well as a lot of different moving parts out there as we work through that. ","Operator","Thank you.

Jeff, you may begin.","Jeff Dietert","Good morning, and welcome to Phillips 66 first quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today's call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Mitchell, Executive Vice President and CFO.","The presentation material we will be using during the call can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our Q&A session.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg Garland for opening remarks.","Greg Garland","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $512 million, or $1.04 per share. We generated $1.3 billion in operating cash flow excluding working capital. Our solid earnings reflect the benefit of our diversified portfolio and we've seen positive impacts from U.S. tax reform. Our strategy is designed to generate long-term value for our shareholders and our employees are executing the strategy well. We've achieved significant growth milestones and completed return enhancement projects.","We're developing new projects with attractive returns that complement our strategy, and by doing all this well we can continue to reward our shareholders with solid distributions. During the quarter we bought back 35 million of our shares in a single transaction and continued with our share repurchase program. All in, we'll return $3.8 billion to shareholders. Since our company formation in 2012, we've returned over $20 billion through dividends, share repurchases and share exchanges. To put this in perspective, our market cap at inception was $20 billion. Today our market cap is over $50 billion, we repurchased exchange close to 30% of our shares outstanding at the time of the spin.","CPChem start-up is new cracker at Cedar Bayou which is one of the largest and most energy efficient crackers in the world. This milestone caps a completion of it's U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project. The cracker reached full design rates in April. CPChem also operated well during the quarter and is fully recovered from the hurricane downtime at Cedar Bayou. With major capital spending now complete and contributions from the new petrochemicals project we expect increased distributions from our chemicals joint venture.","In midstream, Phillips 66 Partners recently announced it will proceed with the construction of the Gray Oak pipeline system. The pipeline will provide crude oil transportation from the Permian Basin to Gulf Coast destinations including our Sweeney Refinery. An extension open season is underway and will determine the ultimate scope and capacity of the pipeline which could be up to 700,000 barrels per day or more. Assuming the pipeline is fully subscribed the capacity could be expanded to about one million barrels per day. The pipeline is backed by long-term take or pay commitments with primarily investment grade customers and is expected to be complete by the end of 2019. Phillips 66 Partners will be the largest equity owner in this joint venture project.","Construction continues on the Bayou Bridge pipeline extension from Lake Charles to St. James, Louisiana. Commercial operations are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2018. Existing segment of the line from our Beaumont Terminal to Lake Charles is operating well and is providing crude optionality to our Lake Charles refinery. PSXP has a 40% ownership in Bayou Bridge. Phillips 66 continues to expand the Beaumont Terminal where we're adding 3.5 million barrels of fully contracted crude oil storage. This project will bring our total crude and product storage capacity at Beaumont to 14.6 million barrels by year end. The Sand Hills pipeline capacity was closed to 400,000 barrels per day at the end of the first quarter, further capacity expansion to over 450,000 barrels a day is anticipated in the second half of 2018. The pipeline transports natural gas liquids from the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast of Texas and is owned two-thirds by DCP and one-third by Phillips 66 Partners.","DCP continues to progress construction of two 200 million cubic feet per day gas processing plants and the high growth DJ Basin. The Mewbourn 3 plant is expected to start up in the third quarter of 2018 and the O'Conner 2 plant is scheduled for completion in mid-2019. DCP is also participating in the Gulf Coast Express pipeline project in which it holds a 25% interest. The pipeline will provide an outlet for natural gas production in the Permian Basin to markets along the Texas Gulf Coast. The pipeline has a total design capacity of approximately 2 billion cubic feet per day and is nearly fully subscribed. The pipeline is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019.","In refining, we recently completed SEC unit modernization projects at the Bayway and Wood River refineries. At both facilities we replaced the FCC reactor system with state-of-the-art technology. The projects were completed on-time and on-budget. Units have been operating as planned and early operating data is showing an increased field of high value clean products as premise. At the Lake Charles refinery, we completed crude unit modifications to run more domestic crudes which improves our supply optionality. Additional improvements are planned to be completed in the fourth quarter.","Finally, we're very honored that four of our refineries were recently recognized by the AFPM for excellent safety performance in 2017. Our Bayway refinery received the Distinguished Safety Award which is the highest annual safety award given by or industry. The Sweeney Alliance and Woodward refineries were also recognized for their Top Tier safety excellence. I'm very proud of the people of Phillips 66 and their strong commitment to our safety culture.","So with that I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financials.","Kevin Mitchell","Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide 4, first quarter earnings were $524 million. We had special items that netted to a gain of $12 million. After excluding special items, adjusted earnings were $512 million or $1.04 per share. Operating cash flow excluding working capital was $1.3 billion. Capital spending for the quarter was $328 million with $171 million spent on growth projects. First quarter distributions to shareholders consisted of $3.5 billion in share repurchases and $327 million in dividends.","Slide 5 compares first quarter and fourth quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings decreased by $36 million driven by lower refining results, mostly offset by improvements in chemicals, midstream and marketing; highlighting the benefit of our diversified portfolio. Slide 6 shows our midstream results; transportation adjusted net income for the quarter was $136 million, up $28 million from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to lower taxes and operating costs. Volumes were lower in the first quarter due to the impact of turnarounds at certain of our refineries.","NGL and other adjusted net income was $73 million compared with $20 million in the fourth quarter. Our first quarter earnings reflect improved realized margins and positive inventory impacts. We continue to one run well at our Sweeny Hub [ph] this quarter averaging about nine cargos a month at the export facility, and 95% utilization at the fractionator. However U.S. Gulf Coast to Asia margins remain challenged. DCP Midstream had adjusted net income of $24 million in the first quarter. The $10 million increase from the previous quarter was due to the timing of incentive distributions, hedging gains and lower taxes. The increase was partially offset by lower volumes. DCP has steadily improved it's financial condition, EBITDA is growing, it's generating positive cash flow and making distributions to our owners [ph].","Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7; first quarter adjusted net income for the segment was $232 million, $111 million higher than the fourth quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, adjusted net income increased $129 million from higher margins and volumes reflecting the Cedar Bayou facilities return to full operations. Global O&P utilization was 96%, up from 79% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted net income for SA&S decreased by $16 million due to turnarounds.","In Refining; crude utilization was 89% compared with 100% in the fourth quarter. Clean product yield was 83%, a decrease of 4 percentage points. Both, our utilization and clean product yield were lower due to turnaround impacts. Pre-tax turnaround costs were $245 million, an increase of $146 million from the previous quarter; this excludes the turnaround costs for our joint venture WRB. Realized margin was $9.29 per barrel, up from $8.98 per barrel last quarter. Although the market crack decreased 6%, our actual realized margins improved 3% from wider crude differentials, specifically heavy Canadian.","The chart on Slide 8 provides a regional view of the change in adjusted net income. In total, refining's first quarter adjusted net income was $89 million, down $269 million from last quarter due to lower volumes and higher costs associated with turnarounds; this decrease was partially offset by higher realized margins. In the Atlantic Basin, the $193 million decrease in adjusted net income was mostly due to a major turnaround at the Bayway refinery. The Gulf Coast adjusted net income decreased $71 million mainly due to turnarounds at the Sweeney and Alliance refineries.","Adjusted net income in the central corridor was $203 million, an increase of $11 million from higher realized margins driven by Canadian crude oil differentials. The impact from the fourth quarter completion of Ponca City refinery turnaround was more than offset by first quarter turnarounds at the Wood River and Boga [ph] refineries. In the West Coast, adjusted net income decreased $16 million from the previous quarter mainly due to lower volumes.","Slide 9 covers market capture [ph]; the 3:2:1 market crack for the first quarter was $13.12 per barrel compared to $13.98 in the fourth quarter. Our realized margin for the first quarter was $9.29 per barrel resulting in an overall market capture of 71%, up from 64% in the fourth quarter. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries. We made less gasoline and more distillate on premise in the 3:2:1 market crack. Losses from secondary products of $1.47 per barrel were lower than the previous quarter by $0.52 per barrel. Feedstock advantage improved realized margins by $1.63 per barrel which was $0.81 per barrel better than the prior quarter from the widening WTI\/WCS differential.","The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. This category reduced realized margins by $2.08 per barrel compared with $2.39 per barrel in the prior quarter. The improvement was driven by lower RINs costs.","Let's move to marking and specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted first quarter net income was $174 million, $50 million higher than the fourth quarter. In marketing and other, the $42 million increase in adjusted net income was due to improved realized margins and lower taxes and operating costs; this was partially offset by lower volumes. During the first quarter we exported 190,000 barrels per day of refined products, we continue to see strong export demand during the quarter. Specialties adjusted net income was $45 million, an increase of $8 million from the prior quarter mainly due to lower taxes.","During the first quarter we completed the restructuring of our XL Power Loops [ph] lives joint venture, both partners contributed their base oil businesses to the venture to create an integrated manufacturing and marketing business. The JV restructuring provides XL Power Loops [ph] with greater agility to provide quality base oil solutions to our customers.","On Slide 11 the corporate and other segment had adjusted net costs of $162 million this quarter compared with $140 million in the prior quarter. The $22 million increase reflects the ongoing impact of lower tax rates on our corporate costs. Slide 12 highlights the change in cash during the quarter. We entered the year with $3.1 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Cash from operations excluding the impact from working capital was $1.3 billion. Working capital changes reduced cash flow by about $800 million largely due to normal seasonal inventory builds.","We funded approximately $300 million of capital expenditures and investments, and we distributed $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of over 37 million shares, and in the quarter with 466 million shares outstanding. We also received $1.5 billion from the issuance of debt. Our ending cash balance was $842 million.","This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items.","In the second quarter in chemicals we expect a global O&P utilization rates to be in the mid-90s. In refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and pre-tax turnaround expenses to be between $90 million and $120 million. We anticipate second quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $170 million and $190 million after-tax. The increased guidance reflects interest expense associated with our first quarter issuance of debt.","With that, we'll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And you have a question from Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.","Doug Terreson","Good morning, everybody and congratulations on having the financial strength to be able to repurchase 7% of your equity in one quarter, we don't see that often, that's pretty impressive. So my question is about AMO 2020 and specifically, how you guys are thinking about the type of products that are likely to be provided to the market as it seems that many of these deals are still in the design phase and there is still lot of unknowns in that area? And when you think about marine fuel blends, how challenging the issues of compatibility and stability are likely to be? And also availability along the marine field network as the market goes through the transition in coming years. So two questions on AMO 2020.","Greg Garland","While we know the star -- the sulfur content of marker fuels, we don't have the detailed specifications yet, they're still evolving. We do expect a significant influx of diesel into the bunker category, we talked about last quarter kind of 2 million to 3 million barrels a day, increased diesel demand. Secondly, we do expect low sulfur cat cracker feed to be an attractive stock for bunker fuels as well which will support the gasoline markets also. We're expecting the turnover of tanks and blending infrastructure to start next year perhaps some time around mid-year and so it's a big shift and we're preparing for that.","I think one of the things that I would mention is just that our portfolio -- our existing refining assets are well positioned for this IMO transition, we've got very high distilled yield, about 41% last year, $1 a barrel distillate change margin is $300 million in EBITDA. In addition, we expect fuel oil to weigh on heavy crude prices. We have heavy crude of about 700,000 barrels a day or about 35% of our total portfolio. We have more coking capacity at 470,000 barrels a day than the peers, every dollar per barrel change in heavy crude discount is about $250 million in EBITDA. So our portfolio is well positioned the way it stands today.","Doug Terreson","It sounds like it -- I just wanted to follow-up on your point about diverting vacuum gas all around the crack or straight to the marine fuel pool. I mean it seems that that would surely enhance marine fuel supply but it also seems like it would come at the expense of gasoline supply and that might make it somewhat of a zero sum game. So would you disagree with that, number one? Number two, how commonly is that practice been employed in the industry; meaning is this something that you guys have done frequently or have we seen this before?","Greg Garland","This is something that we expect to be more of a new activity which converting from Max gasoline to Max diesel during the summer months as well as pulling some of the cat cracker feed. I think we'll support gasoline margins as well as supporting diesel cracks.","Operator","Next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta","First question I had was just around capital spending. I know it's really early in the year but CapEx was below -- certainly, the annualized run rate that you've kind of guided to -- can you just speak to the guidance and whether there is a downward factors to it and just the timing of spend as well?","Greg Garland","Neil, I think we're consistent with the guidance around the 2:3. I think that we were a little lie the first quarter and we knew we were going to be when we put the plan in place but 2:3 is still good guidance for us this year.","Neil Mehta","Second question on the quarter; Midstream big part of the beat, NGL and other was a driver of that and other some inventory benefits there, can you just kind of speak to what some of those dynamics were and how we should think about the run rate going forward?","Kevin Mitchell","As you look at that, so I think the NGL segment reported $73 million of income in the quarter. About $20 million of that is associated with inventory LIFO related items, nothing specifically unusual in what happened, it's just that the magnitude and it's positive in the quarter and these things will happen from time to time and it can go in the opposite direction also. But as you look at that and try and think about our run rate going forward, you probably ought to back out somewhere in the order of $20 million from what we reported in the first quarter.","Neil Mehta","That's helpful. And last question for me; on Permian differentials you guys have a good perspective on this, it's just over the next two years their absence of major pipeline is still the back half of 2019; how do we get the crude to market from West Texas?","Greg Garland","I think it's a good question. You're correct, the next major pipelines are scheduled for the back half of 2019. We saw about 750,000 barrels a day of new capacity that was added late last year and early this year, and it certainly appears that that pipeline capacity is filling up more rapidly than anticipated. As we look at alternative route options, trucking is one. That's kind of a $12 a barrel movement at this point although that's not going to be a steady number. A typical truck can haul about 180 barrels of crude, it's roughly a 500-mile haul from the Permian to the Gulf Coast, it's a day -- 2-day round trip, so you need 100 trucks to move 10,000 barrels a day. It's not really realistic to expect to move 100,000 barrels a day or 200,000 barrels a day, it's just not really practical.","From a rail perspective, there is not a lot of rail facilities. Most of the rail facilities in the Permian Basin are now designed for frac sand and not crude movement, and so that's not a great option. So we are in need of new pipeline capacity serving the Permian Basin. I think there's a lot of talk on the crude side and when you look at the Midland differential to East Houston, it's out to $9 a barrel, when there was enough infrastructure that was kind of $3 a barrel differential. When you look at natural gas as well, waha [ph] prices have declined about $1 in MMBTU relative to where they were last year, and that sets a lower price for natural gas and ethane rejection; so we may see some additional ethane production coming out of the Permian Basin as well.","Operator","Next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez","First one is just more housekeeping, probably for Kevin. The tax rate seemed really low in the quarter, I'm just trying to figure out if that's maybe some one-off issues driving that or if that's kind of sustainable?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes Blake, it is a little bit low and it really reflects the mixed effect of certain items in the portfolio; so the higher proportion of international earnings than I would say normal in part because of the amount of U.S. refining turnaround activity we had, so relatively low U.S. refining earnings contribution. Some of that dynamic as you look in the chemical segment, the Middle East joint ventures that CPChem has -- so that's in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, those are equity method accounting accounted at the CPChem level and those equity earnings are after-tax. So the entities themselves pay tax and that flows through after-tax. And so that has the impact of reducing the overall effective tax rate and it's more pronounced than a period where the other pre-tax income is lower because of -- for example, turn around impacts.","You also have the effect of non-controlling interest in the effective tax rate calculation. We factor that into our overall guidance range effective tax rates but again when the rest of the portfolio is in a relatively low earnings quarter it has a slightly bigger impact. So all in, as we look at where this -- where we expect this to be on an ongoing basis, we'd still come back to -- it should be low 20s from an effective tax rate standpoint.","Blake Fernandez","Got it, thank you. Greg I'll go out on a limb and assume that the buyback level of $3.8 billion in the first quarter is not sustainable. As we kind of get our bearing straight after that big slug; do you have any thoughts around the way we should think about that moving forward?","Greg Garland","Yes, I think we'll stick with our guidance of $1 billion to $2 billion of share repurchases in 2018. We maybe towards the lower end of the range given what we've done in the first quarter but yes, we'll still be buying shares, we're buying today.","Operator","Next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil Gresh","First question is just on some of the cash flow items, I guess that's for Kevin. The ending cash balance obviously given the repurchase in the quarter; how do you think about managing the cash balances and where you'd like to have them? And I guess a related question to that is -- should we be thinking of dropdowns to PSXP as a -- I guess the driver of some cash that would potentially make it's way to the parent company this year or with the organic opportunities available at PSXP is that not necessarily something that we would be thinking about?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes Phil, so a couple of comments on that. Obviously the drawdown in the cash was a function of the buyback, so we did a $3.3 billion buyback with Berkshire and we issued $1.5 billion of debt; so we consumed a fair amount of cash in doing that. Part of the reason we were able to do that is, if you think back to tax reform and the ability to get access to cash that previously was -- it wasn't trapped internationally but there was a greater cost to accessing that cash, and so we've taken advantage of that. And so what that means is, on a go-forward basis we have the ability to utilize more -- get more access to overall available cash balances. In terms of as you look out the year, we typically don't give what we haven't given guidance on dropdown plans around that. But as we commented or stated in the PSXP earnings release, we're not that far from our stated 2018 EBITDA guidance at the MLP level. So there is potential with organic growth projects underway at the MLP. Dropdown needs would be pretty minimal from an MLP growth standpoint and I wouldn't imagine we'd be in a situation where we would just force a draw to provide funding back up to the parent; all those decisions are made from us at a long-term MLP growth perspective.","Phil Gresh","That's very helpful, thanks. I guess the second question; a bit more of a strategic one for Greg. Just thinking about the current environment for chemical margins, obviously your cracker coming on-stream sounds like it's going really well in terms of the startup. If you look at the margin profile out there, ethylene margins are challenged but the full chain margins are still holding in pretty strongly. So how do you think about the chemical environment and what it might mean for the timing of a second cracker?","Greg Garland","Well, I mean first of all it was a great startup, I think it's one of the better startups we've had in the last few that we've executed. So kudos to the CPChem folks who are doing a great job to get that cracker up and running it at full rates. The derivatives were up in the fourth quarter last year, Dow is up and so we've been up since really the fourth quarter and the market -- so the market facing element of those projects are out there in the markets and you look at kind of the full chain margin which is what we really care about, what that's spread between ethane and say polyethylene, and particularly high density polyethylene and as you said, those margins are pretty similar.","So we've been able to move the products into the markets without a really detrimental effect on the margins at this point in time, the chain margin; and I think that really speaks to the demand that we're seeing out there, we're seeing good fundamental demand growth in North America, Europe, Asia for petrochemicals but specifically for polyethylene. You've got ExxonMobil coming up later this year, then you have two crackers coming up in '19, and what's happened -- we thought these crackers are all going to hit in 2017, it just didn't happen and so they are getting spaced out and the markets being able to absorb these volumes that are coming on -- couple with good demand growth globally.","And so as we start thinking about that next cracker, we like what we see in terms of NGL supply, increasing NGL is coming particularly out of Permian but from the U.S. Gulf Coast is a good place to build the next cracker we believe. We're still kind of 2019 probably for an FID on that facility.","Operator","Next question comes from Mina [ph] with Credit Suisse.","Unidentified Analyst","I had a quick question on the Mitcon [ph] results which were very strong. So I'm trying to understand how much of WCS you were running in the Mitcon and did you actually uptake the intake of WCS in your Mitcon system which got reflected in those very high capture?","Greg Garland","We imported 550 million of Canadian imports on average for 2017 or 1,000 million, sorry, thank you. And some of that was for -- our net -- we were about 450 million and 80% of that was Canadian heavy. And -- so that's the range of what we'd expect to run on an annual basis, we don't intend on updating that on a quarterly basis but we continue to import as we could on the Canadian heavy front.","Unidentified Analyst","Jeff, my phone up is on the question that Phil also asked was; I'm trying to understand were you actually shot ethylene in 1Q '18 because what I'm trying to get to is the $232 million net income you reported; would that have been like $250 million and $260 million had your ethylene cracker actually been running and you were not shot of ethylene in that period?","Jeff Dietert","No, weren't short of ethylene. We had an ethylene inventory and there was plenty of ethylene available in the industry and I think that's what you're seeing in terms of just say ethylene margin itself.","Operator","Next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","I guess if we could maybe hit the midstream segment one more time, I mean that has just been going back to the last year, year and a half; pretty tough sector until the fourth quarter, now the first quarter. So can you kind of walk us through how much of this is sort of market conditions changed, right oil prices recovered and how much of it is -- you know, the new project is coming online as well as just internal restructuring and so forth? And then, maybe kind of help us understand the sustainability here going forward, Exxon oil price continuing to increase, you're holding at these levels.","Greg Garland","I think you want to start -- NGLs have certainly recovered versus say a year ago in terms of pricing. First quarter volumes were seasonally -- they were lower than the fourth quarter or third quarter but that's just seasonal, weather related impacts, particularly around the NGL side for us. You have the Sweeny Hub that's performing albeit not at the level that we would expect if you take the first quarter, then you kind of analyze those results we get to pay $130 million, $140 million of annualized EBITDA out of the Hub. We've laid in the plan as we said previously, $150 million of EBITDA for the Hub this year; and that's against an expectation of kind of $300 million to $400 million without the ARB [ph].","So I think that that asset still has room to go and as we look at the NGLs are coming at us out of the Permian this year, we do think that these across the doc are going to go up to get in the back half of this year and certainly into next year, so we see continued improvement there. We certainly have the new pipe Stapel [ph] is on, Bayou Bridge is on, so a lot of it is around the new assets that we've been bringing on that have been driving this.","Jeff Dietert","Roger, I might just highlight; I know you're aware but in our supplemental reports on Page 6, we identified midstream adjusted EBITDA and if you look at PSXP and other midstream, it generated about $363 million of EBITDA in the first quarter. If you were to annualize that it's about $1.45 billion. We've also got about $300 million of refining assets and that's -- ties back with the $1.8 billion to $2 billion of EBITDA that we've talked about in our presentation material. So that supplemental report will give you a scorecard to keep track on our progress.","Roger Read","And then maybe you could just -- a complete change of direction here; RINs, you mentioned in the presentation part that lower RINs -- it helps out a little bit. Just curious what your expectation is if anything for -- let's call it potential RINs reform as we see '18 unfold.","Greg Garland","So I'd answer the question this way, wherever hopeful. I'm just not sure we're going to get there. There is a lot of good work that's going on, AFPM, API; management teams are in Washington talking to Congress about potential reform. Our view is that it's broke, the system is broke, we need to fix it and so we'll see but I don't hold a lot of hope for 2018. Now some of my friends in the business are a lot more optimistic than I am that we'll get something done in 2018. I guess the other impact that you're seeing is the small refinery exceptions and that has certainly had an impact on the RINs prices. So we'll continue to follow, we'll continue to work it and continue to be hopeful we get to a resolution there.","Operator","Next question comes from Justin Jenkins with Raymond James.","Justin Jenkins","I guess maybe in midstream with the Gray Oak projects, not sure how far I'll get here but have to try. Can we get a ballpark of maybe total capital cost fairly the range on that project? And then along that line maybe the confidence you had to push the spend down directly to PS 60 at the outset here?","Greg Garland","Yes, so two parts. First part is really can't comment, we're an extension open season and the actual volumes that we end up with will dictate the size of the pie, the actual capital cost. You should expect that I would say 45 to 60 days will get this wrapped and then we'll come back and we'll tell you what the capital cost is going to be on the line. And we started at kind of 380 in the open season, I would just tell you we obviously did got more interest than that and that really kind of encouraged us to move on with the extension of the open season. So I think we're really optimistic on the line and we're the ultimate capacity, it lands on that line. And then as you think about the decision of where to place it, we've always said we want to execute as many of the organic projects as we can at PSXP and given this pipeline, we have increased the budget of PSXP for this year and Gray Oak is part of the reason we increased that. But you shouldn't look at that increase as the total cost of the pipeline if you want to think about it that way.","So anyway, I think that Gray Oak is a great opportunity for our Company, it's certainly a great opportunity for Phillips 66 Partners, and we'll continue to make decisions about where do we place these projects, either PSX or PSXP obviously. But we'll continue to put as much as we can to PSXP and execute as much organic growth as we can at the MLP and that's very consistent with what we've been saying for the past couple of years.","Justin Jenkins","And I guess shifting gears maybe on cash returns; I understand you answered Phil's question earlier about the buyback but how should we think about maybe the mix of returns going forward? Here we've got a good problem to have with the dividend yield, maybe as low as we can remember in a while but the mix of the buyback versus dividend growth or maybe faster dividend growth going forward?","Greg Garland","Yes, I still think that if you think we're kind of $5 billion to $6 billion of cash at mid-cycle generation we can afford to -- first, $1 billion outstanding capital, the dividends of $1.04 billion, now that gives you a lot of room to grow the dividend but also execute a $1 billion to $2 billion growth program and $1 billion to $2 billion share repurchase program. And so that's how we continue to think about it at mid-cycle. Certainly as these new projects come on and we're going to add another $1 billion to $1.5 billion of EBITDA that increases our capability to fund or reinvest in the Company but we'll -- we're sticking with the 60:40 guidance, it's going to be really hard to hit that this year because we're already 3:8 distributions against the 2:3 capital budget and we just don't see ourselves really materially changing the capital guidance at this point in time in the year. So we'll be having on the distribution side in '18 but long-term we do like that 60:40 mix.","Kevin Mitchell","And just to add Justin on dividend, no change from what we've said in the past in terms of secure, competitive and growing. So we'll continue to grow the dividend, just because we did the big share buyback this year doesn't preclude us from increasing the dividends as well this year.","Operator","Next question comes from Doug [ph] with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Unidentified Analyst","A couple of follow-ups actually on that last question Greg, if I may. Obviously your share price is substantially above when you set the original distribution policy I guess. What about the mix between dividends and buybacks as part of that 60:40 split? Do you see yourself skewing more to back to the dividend or is -- are you kind of agnostic to the share price as it released to where you're buying back shares?","Greg Garland","No, I wouldn't say we are -- well, first of all, on share repurchase it's all intrinsic value. And as we've said, we're using historical multiples and our view of EBITDA essentially, kind of two years out. As long as shares trade below that we're going to be buying shares. When you think about the dividend to Kevin's point; secure growing -- I think investors need to see that we have runway to continue to grow the dividend and we want to grow the dividend every year. We think it needs to be competitive, we look around and kind of what's the S&P to 100 yields or what's the yields of our competitors; and so we make sure we've got a very competitive dividend in the group. So we'll always grow the dividend but we'll grow it within those parameters in the extent that we're balancing between reinvestment and share repurchase, we'll buy the shares in.","Unidentified Analyst","So is it dividends per share or dividends per se; in other words, when you buy back stock is that counted as part of the dividend growth per share or not?","Greg Garland","We're looking at dividends per share.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. So my follow-up is more of a macro question Greg, and it kind of goes back to the dinner you hosted back in December. I think you talked about the IMO issues has been more -- I don't know if it's worse in a month or more kind of transitory when it happens and not something that you would expect to work through the system. I'm just wondering your views of changed or not? I understand you're well positioned for it regardless of what happens but do you see it as more enduring or still somewhat short-lived when it gets implemented in 2020?","Greg Garland","Yes, my own personal view and Jeff can jump in on this if he has to do. This is -- I don't know if it's going to short-lived but I think within a couple years you'll see that actually competed away.","Operator","Next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern","I was wondering on the crude export front, since you guys have Belmont and so on. We're export over 2 million barrels a day now, most people are expecting a million barrels a day of growth in the U.S. So is there the infrastructure in place to or will be in place to export 3 million plus barrels a day next year? And then 4 million in 2020 and on down the line?","Greg Garland","Yes, you're right, we've seen a number of weeks over 2 million barrels a day of exports. We've expanded our capacity at Belmont to go from 400,000 barrels a day to 600,000 barrels a day. You saw we're participating in the Buckeye facility in corpus as well associated with the Gray Oak pipeline. We are seeing the expansion of export capability, it's one part of the value chain that's going to have to grow in order to continue to export and we think the majority of the incremental production is going to be exported. So we think maybe there's 3 million barrels a day capacity today but that number is growing, we don't see an immediate issue there at this point.","Brad Heffern","And then maybe for Kevin; you guys gave the mid-90s utilization guidance for CPChem. I assume that that's off of a new base, so if you could just clarify that if that's the case and if that's for the whole quarter and sort of what the new capacity number is that that 95% is based on?","Kevin Mitchell","Brad, you're correct that with the crackers starting up, the declared commercial operations on it in April, and so that adds it into the denominator from a total capacity standpoint. So the new polyethylene units were already reflected in the denominator, the new cracker is in effective second quarter; so that 96% includes our assumptions around what all the new units will be running.","Operator","Next question comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd","Maybe I want to start off on product exports. I mean can you talk about the dynamics that you're seeing right now in product exports due to sequential decrease I think quarter-on-quarter. But it seems like we're also seeing reports that demand to ship is colonial [ph] has dropped to very low levels. I mean what are you seeing in terms of sequential drivers? What are you seeing in terms of relative netbacks, so that you can see domestically versus export and your ability to kind of capitalize on that going forward?","Greg Garland","You're right, our product exports were down 190,000 barrels a day this quarter, about 90,000 barrels a day of that was gasoline and 100,000 barrels a day was diesel. We had refinery maintenance at Alliance in particular that reduced the availability of product that we could put into the export market. We are continuing to see strong demand, continued struggles with refining capacity in Latin America and so we expect that to hold up longer term.","Ryan Todd","And then maybe of a follow-up on -- since you brought up your personal views Greg on the duration of the IMO benefits; how do you think that it gets -- how do you think the ARB [ph] gets competed away. I mean, I don't disagree that it will be but at this point we've seen from for the most part independent refiners holding a relatively good line in terms of incremental investment; you're not planning for any large scale material investments to kind of compete away the ARB [ph]. How does it get competed away and who is that? Is it the majors and the global NOCs of the world and Asia that kind of competes the way they are how do you think that plays out?","Greg Garland","I think you'll see continued investment in Asia in refining capacity, that's a big fuel market obviously. I suspect there will be continued discipline, we don't plan to make big investments, really just swing the portfolio. I think we've got plenty of capability as we sit today, there may be small things that we do along the way but I just -- it's just -- this industry, we just have a long history of being able to compete away really good margins and whether it's $5 or $15 on the distillate crack, I don't know what that's going to be; probably on the low end of that one for a couple years. But I think you're in a time, certainly '19 or '20 when we're going to really like the refining business and the margins and the cash is coming off this business but you know, to get out another three or four years ago it gets really hard to forecast.","Kevin Mitchell","One other thing I would add is we're not seeing the adoption of scrubbers at the pace that we anticipated a few months ago. I think it's been much lower and depending on the availability of the 3.5 [ph] fuel; after the changes are implemented, perhaps there may be a more rapid adoption of scrubbers but that's going to depend on the availability of the fuel and a number of items that are just hard to predict at this time.","Greg Garland","I guess the other thing longer term too in terms of newbuilds in the shipping industry; if you relate the high end of the range I think people have to start talking about LNG and you know other options too. So I mean these things always come into balance by many factors really, we're working on that equation, it's not just going to be refining capacity, it's going to be the choice of the ship owners and we'll see where does it go.","Operator","Next question comes from Prasant Rao [ph] with Citi.","Unidentified Analyst","I wanted to ask this a different way, I know we've talked about IMO and the discrete window and Greg I agree this is something that does get competed away. But if you think about increasing clean product yields and specifically you guys have a few projects in 4Q, in trials and then you did a few earlier already. There is a baseline growth of clean product demand globally and export demand, and that feels like something that is more buildable towards. So I wanted to get a sense of IMO aside, what are your thoughts on a multi-year basis in terms of how that ramps? At what point -- how you build towards that in terms of incremental investment, not the IMO impact which feels like just an upside shock but more the secular growth flick could be multi-year that we've seen for several years here; what can we expect in terms of incremental investment towards that?","Greg Garland","From our perspective it's $300 million a year, give or take is what we've been investing in refining to either improve yields or to access more advantage crude, one way or the other. I think the other part of the equation that we haven't talked about today and we could have touched on it in our past discussion but I think we're going to move to a higher octane fuel. And so I think that over a period of whatever 10 or 12 or 15 years, whatever it takes, you will see the industry invest to make a higher octane fuel assuming that gets done here in the next year or so. So I think there will be investable opportunities for refiners and for PSX that are -- what I would say not multi-million dollar investments but solid -- high returning projects for us; and so we'll always do that.","The industry itself seems to have the ability, every time we do a turnaround we replace an exchanger that was a bottleneck for us or whatever; and we can create 1% or 2% a year, I think you'll continue to see that happen in the industry as we move forward. So I think it will be a combination of specific investments that people want to make to address the yield or advantage crude and then you to see the general creep [ph] that we tend to have in industry.","Kevin Mitchell","There aren't attractive projects to invest in, we'll continue to buyback stock and reduce the share account and make it accretive that way.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just a follow-up on something; Greg you came a lot of detail on this about the potential for the timing of the second cracker but I wanted to focus more and less on the margins and more on sort of the timing of the shift that we've seen in terms of the majors announcing their plans for petrochemical opportunities and investments and sort of -- over the last few months, how the industry book of projects in valuations may have been moving this and if those dynamics in anyway impact or sharpen your plans in terms of the potential plans for another cracker in the Gulf and in terms of timing how that -- there is a lot of moving parts there, so just wanted to get a sense on that particular piece of it, not necessarily the margin recoveries?","Greg Garland","Well, I mean certainly it's a joint decision between the owners of CPChem and I think we have to have an agreed view of when the appropriate time that cracker is. At the CPChem level we're thinking about how do we move our products into the market in the most efficient manner, and we're the world's largest producer of high density polyethylene and these projects are generally geared towards that although we've added quite a bit of NAO capacity over the past couple of years also. So we're thinking about how do we efficiently move these products into the market; and so that's one thing we think about in terms of the timing decision, obviously NGL supplied feedstock supply those factor into those decisions of where you're going to build it and what are you going to build, ethane or some LPG cracker. And so I think that there's kind of multiple decision points that we go through when we're thinking about the timing on a cracker.","One other things we wanted to make sure that there were some daylight in between when this Gulf Coast cracker project one came out and when we would do the second one. And so you kind of think of coming up in '18 and having most of '19; it seems like appropriate timing to us in terms of FID in light '19 and really getting started in earnest in '20 and '21 on the construction.","Operator","Next question comes from Paul Chang with Barclays.","Paul Chang","A number of quick questions. Kevin, I think last year or a couple of years ago, you were talking about going forward you may want to keep the consolidate debt to be flat, so that you would reduce some of the C-corp level at the MLP level going up; is that still the objective going forward or that -- I mean over the past couple of years I think all that has been going up. So should we assume in the next 12 to 18 months that the cash flow increase further? Are you going to use a portion of them that trying to pay down your debt?","Kevin Mitchell","Some of this has been a function of -- debt has gone up on a consolidated level over the last year or two, and a big factor there has been the transaction we just did in the first quarter with the large share buybacks, so that added $1.5 billion of debt that we hadn't anticipated doing. But as we look ahead and we see a period of reasonably strong margins, you've got new projects coming online, you've got chemicals with the new assets up and running and expect increased distributions out of chemicals. We think we'll have the ability to pay down some of that debt over the next couple of years or so, I think you kind of got to that point that we have the ability to potentially bring debt back down a $1 billion or $1.5 billion or so over the next couple of years if margins hold in where we think they're going to be.","Paul Chang","But you don't want to do even more than just $1 billion, $1.5 billion from the current rate?","Kevin Mitchell","It depends, I mean it's going to be somewhat dependent on the relative -- the alternative opportunities. The $1.5 billion we just added was clearly incremental debt, so it would be nice to be able to take care of that over the next near-term period, couple of years or so; and then it becomes opportunistic, what's the best use of available cash and it will depend on what the investment opportunities look like, where the share price trades and opportunities around share buybacks, and so it will be that continual sort of balancing act across those capital allocation decisions.","Greg Garland","I think one thing that hasn't changed is really our view that we want to maintain a strong investment grade rating. So I think that really comes into play, we've always said around 30% debt to capital or 31% or so today, so we're slightly over that. But we'd used the 30% as kind of a proxy of a strong investment grade rating. But as we look at the debt and the capacity that we have today, we're comfortable with this level of debt at the Company. And as we said, we've got strong investment grade ratings today.","Paul Chang","Greg, it seems that my understanding of the chemical is as you comment, you know as much as anyone; can you just give us a maybe easy way. With the new event cracker, if we're looking at today's margin, what is the contribution off the net income to you guys going to be?","Greg Garland","Well, from an EBITDA basis, kind of it at today's margins at the CPChem level kind of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. So $500 million to $600 million of EBITDA back to us is an easy way to think about that.","Paul Chang","Okay. So that is -- if today's margin hold because there the ethylene margin is already pretty low and you already have to pick it up from last year; so incrementally as Sweeny [ph] just on the ethylene margin. And that $1.2 billion is just on the ethylene margin I presume?","Greg Garland","No, that's a full chain margin.","Paul Chang","But you already have the PE margin from last year, right. So yes, I'm looking at incrementally with these clean cracker come on-stream; so what is the additional uptake that we should assume?","Greg Garland","First of all, we're in startup right in the fourth quarter of last year. We're using ethylene that it either be inventoried or purchased and so you really didn't get the full impact of the new cracker being up. So the new cracker is probably our lowest increment of cost as we think about our value chain and the other crackers in our system, and so I think you -- the $1.2 billion is a good number if you want to think about this year, annualized.","Paul Chang","Final one for me; how much is [indiscernible] can assess by pipeline into your refinery?","Kevin Mitchell","Paul, for commercial reasons we don't talk about individual sourcing of feedstock for individual refineries.","Paul Chang","Okay. Or that can you tell us that which refinery -- I noted that you've won mostly in Berga [ph] how about the Ponca City and all the one, can you give us some idea which one may have assess?","Greg Garland","Well, I think as you look at the Phillips 66 portfolio, we're roughly 35% heavy, 35% medium and 30% light on the portfolio as a whole.","Kevin Mitchell","And some of that light is imported.","Paul Chang","I understand. And some of the light is also not from Midland [ph], it's probably from cushing or some other places.","Kevin Mitchell","Right, correct.","Operator","Thank you. We have now reached the time limit available for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeff Dietert","Thank you, Sharon. And thank all of you for your interest in Phillips 66. If you have additional questions, please call Rosie or me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

My name is Erica and I will be the operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Rosy Zuklic, General Manager, Investor Relations. Rosy, you may begin.","Rosy Zuklic","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Phillips 66 second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; Tim Taylor, President; and Kevin Mitchell, Executive Vice President and CFO.","The presentation material, we will be using during the call can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website along with supplemental financial and operating information.","Slide two contains our Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ from today's comments. And factors that could cause those differences are listed here as well as in our filings with the SEC.","With that, I'll turn the call to Greg Garland for opening remarks. Greg?","Greg Garland","Thanks, Rosy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're committed to our strategy growing our high-value businesses and our focus on performing well. Operating excellence remains a top priority, operating safely, running our assets well and managing costs.","During the quarter, we delivered solid operational excellence performance. Refining performed at record rates, achieving 100% utilization. For the first half of the year, our personal safety metric, which we believe was already among the best in our industry, improved 16%; and our process safety metric improved 75% compared to the prior year.","In Chemicals, CPChem completed three major turnaround this quarter. The global olefins and polyolefins businesses operated 91% of capacity. PCP NGL volumes were up and reliability of operations improved. Total adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $499 million. The market environment remained challenging as low margins continue to impact our DCP Midstream, NGL trading and refining businesses.","Our fee-based midstream business performed well and we continue to see good demand in Chemicals. Although demand for refined products is up relative to last year, the weighted average market crack was more than $5 per barrel below where it was a year-ago and crude differentials remained tight.","We remain focused on executing our strategy in those areas under our control. Our growth projects are all progressing well and we continue to see great value and opportunity long-term.","During the second quarter, the Dakota Access Pipeline project began laying pipe and expected to be completed by the end of the year. Once in service, the DAPL\/ETCOP pipeline is expected to provide the most economic option for moving Bakken crude to the Gulf Coast.","In the Gulf Coast, the Beaumont Terminal expansion is ongoing. We have 3.2 million barrels of new storage capacity under construction, two million of which should be in service by year-end. We have plans to ultimately expand this facility to 16 million barrels.","Also in the Gulf, development of the first phase of the Sweeny hub is nearing completion. Sweeny Fractionator One is operating well, however, volume mix across all of our fractionators remains impacted by heavier NGL feedstock as a result of continued ethane rejection.","We expect construction of the 150,000 barrel per day Freeport LPG Export Terminal to be completed later this year. Our master limited partnership, Phillips 66 Partners, remains an important part of our midstream growth strategy and a significant source of attractive funding.","In May, we completed $775 million drop-down and PSXP successfully issued over $650 million of public equity. PSXP increased its limited partner distributions by 5% in the second quarter and remains on track to achieve its growth objective of a five-year, 30% distribution compound annual growth rate through 2018.","DCP Midstream is making progress on its strategic initiatives. DCP expects to achieve cash breakeven at NGL prices below $0.35 per gallon this year. DCP is working on its cost structure, reducing capital and converting commodity-exposed contracts to fee-base, to improve financial strength. We expect DCP to be self-funded going forward.","CPChem continues to advance a U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project. It is now 80% complete with expected startup in the second half of 2017. Once running, CPChem's global ethylene and polyethylene capacity will increase by approximately one third. As capital spending is reduced, we should see increased distributions from CPChem starting next year.","During the quarter, we advanced several Refining projects. At the Wood River Refinery, we're undergoing debottlenecking and are on schedule for completion in the third quarter. At the Billings Refinery, efforts are underway to increase the amount of heavy Canadian crude we can run to 100%. At Bayway, work on the FCC modernization is progressing. These are all high return, quick payout projects.","Our Marketing and Specialties segment is the highest returning in our portfolio. In the U.S., we are increasing branded and unbranded volumes and we're selectively pursuing incremental growth opportunities in Europe.","We're mindful of the current market environment and we've maintained our capital disciplined approach in terms of how we allocate capital. We continue to target a long-term 60\/40 split between reinvestment in our business and distributions back to the shareholders.","During the quarter, we generated over $1.8 billion in cash from operations in a PSXP equity offering. We returned over $570 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter and increased our quarterly dividend by 12.5%.","This represents our sixth dividend increase since the formation of our company with a 33% compound annual growth rate. We've returned $12.3 billion to shareholders over this four-year period through dividends and repurchase or exchange of 118 million shares.","We reinvested $620 million into our businesses during the quarter. We're looking at all of our projects in our portfolio to ensure that we only advance projects that meet our return expectations. We've made a decision to defer FID on frac two. We're also working with our partners to project finance DAPL\/ETCOP.","We're going to give you some more detail around our 2016 capital expenditures later this summer; but at this point, we expect our capital expenditures for the year to come in below $3.3 billion, well below our $3.9 billion capital budget.","So, now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to review the quarter results. Kevin?","Kevin Mitchell","Thanks, Greg. Good morning. Starting on slide four; second quarter net income was $496 million, we had two special items that netted to a loss of $3 million. After removing these items, adjusted earnings were $499 million or $0.94 per share.","Cash from operations for the quarter was $1.2 billion, excluding almost $600 million of working capital benefit. Operating cash flow was $560 million. Undistributed equity earnings totaled almost $350 million.","Capital spending for the quarter was $620 million with approximately $340 million spent on growth, mostly in Midstream. Distributions to shareholders in the second quarter totaled $571 million, including $329 million in dividends and $242 million in share repurchases.","At the end of the second quarter, our debt to capital ratio was 27%; after taking into account our ending cash balance, our net debt to capital ratio was 22%. Annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 6% for the first half of 2016. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 31%.","Slide five compares second quarter and first quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were up $139 million, driven mainly by improvements in Chemicals, Refining and Marketing and Specialties.","Next, we will cover each of the segments individually. I'll start with Midstream on slide six. After removing the non-controlling interest of $22 million, Midstream's second quarter adjusted earnings were $39 million, in line with the first quarter.","Our transportation business is composed primarily of fee-based assets. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter were $65 million, down $7 million from the prior quarter, driven by higher operating costs including seasonal maintenance.","Equity earnings from Rockies Express Pipeline were lower due in part to contract restructuring to lengthen the term of a commitment. These items were partially offset by improved volumes.","In NGL, adjusted losses were $17 million for the quarter. The $6 million decrease from the prior quarter was largely driven by project expenses related to the Freeport LPG Export Terminal and lower earnings due to timing effects of seasonal storage. These decreases were partially offset by the benefit of higher fractionation volumes compared to the first quarter.","Adjusted losses for DCP Midstream were $9 million in the second quarter, a $12 million improvement compared to the previous quarter. This was primarily due to improved operational efficiencies, higher recoveries, continued cost savings, and increased commodity prices.","Turning to slide seven. In Chemicals, industry chain margins increased during the quarter as demand for polyethylene remained strong. Second quarter adjusted earnings for the segment were $190 million, up $156 million (sic) from the first quarter.","In olefins and polyolefins, adjusted earnings increased $25 million, largely due to higher margins driven by increased polyethylene sales prices. In addition, equity earnings also improved due to stronger margins. This was partially offset by higher operating costs from planned turnaround activity. Global O&P utilization was 91%. Adjusted earnings for SA&S rose by $9 million on higher equity earnings from increased sales prices.","In Refining, we ran well with 100% crude utilization for the quarter. In addition, clean product yield increased from 82% to 84% with gasoline yield at 45% for the quarter. Pre-tax turnaround costs were $69 million, $31 million lower than guidance due in part to the deferral of certain maintenance activities. Despite higher market cracks in all regions, realized margins were $7.13 per barrel, roughly the same as in the first quarter. This was primarily due to higher losses on secondary products and lower clean product differentials.","The chart on slide eight provides a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. In total, the Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $152 million, up $66 million from last quarter.","Regionally, earnings were higher in the Atlantic Basin, Central Corridor and West Coast, reflecting the benefit of higher margins and volumes. Earnings were lower in the Gulf Coast, as the benefit of higher volumes was more than offset by lower margins caused by lower product differentials and higher secondary product losses.","Next, we'll cover market capture on slide nine. Our worldwide realized margin was $7.13 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $13.84 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 52% compared to 67% in the first quarter.","Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries and our production relative to the market crack calculation. With 84% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack.","Losses from secondary products of $3.41 per barrel were $1.51 per barrel higher this quarter as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such as coke and NGLs increased. Feedstock advantage was slightly higher than the first quarter, but crude differentials generally remained tight.","The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. These costs were higher than the first quarter, primarily due to lower clean product differentials and higher RINs prices.","Let's move to Marketing and Specialties, where we posted a strong second quarter, despite the rising commodity price environment. Adjusted earnings for M&S in the second quarter were $229 million, up $24 million from the first quarter.","In Marketing and Other, the $37 million increase was largely due to higher margins in international marketing and higher domestic gasoline volumes. Specialties' adjusted earnings decreased by $13 million, primarily as a result of lower base oil margins, partially offset by higher lubricants volumes.","On slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had after-tax net costs of $111 million this quarter, an improvement of $16 million from the first quarter. Net interest expense decreased by $2 million, while corporate overhead and other expenses decreased by $14 million, primarily due to lower legal and remediation accruals and lower taxes.","Slide 12 shows cash flow for the year to-date. We began the year with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations in the first half was $1.3 billion. Working capital changes increased cash flow by $100 million.","In May, Phillips 66 Partners raised $656 million in a public equity offering. We funded $1.4 billion of capital expenditures and investments and we distributed nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 523 million shares outstanding.","At the end of June, our cash balance stood at $2.2 billion, up from $1.7 billion at the end of the first quarter. This concludes my review of the financial and operational results.","Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In the third quarter, in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be the mid-90%s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90%s. And before tax turnaround expenses to be between $100 million and $120 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $115 million and $125 million after-tax. And company-wide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30%s.","With that, we'll now open the line for questions.","Rosy Zuklic","Hello, Erica, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez","Folks, good morning. I had two questions for you. One, I wanted to clarify the CapEx comment. I just wanted to make sure that below $3.3 billion was indeed for 2016. And assuming that is the case, with these project deferrals that you've mentioned, I'm assuming that alleviates some of the pressure on 2017 spending, so any kind of thoughts or outlook on 2017 will be helpful.","Greg Garland","So, you're correct. The guidance of below $3.3 billion was for 2016. We're still working 2017, Blake, but we've been saying for most of this year that we are on a glide slope to $3 billion maybe slightly under. So, we'll give you some updates in the fall, of where we're going to be in 2017; but I think around $3 billion, pretty good number for 2017.","Blake Fernandez","Great. Thanks, Greg. The second question is on the economic run cuts. Obviously, we have your guidance here in the mid-90%s, which is below 2Q, but still pretty healthy. Some of your smaller peers are already talking about run cuts in 3Q. I'm just curious, does your guidance contemplate any run cuts or do you envision that happening?","Greg Garland","Well, I think, I'll let Tim jump in on his view in the industry. I think, most of ours is reflective of turnarounds at this point in time. We run our LPs pretty frequently and we'll make those decisions as we get into the third quarter; but I think my personal view is, we've got a lot of inventory stacked up. I think industry is going to be facing run cuts in the second half of the year.","Timothy Taylor","Yeah, Blake, I guess we look at it and we think about the inventories heading in. And it's a global issue as we think about where the supplies come on this year, and ultimately, the way to rebalance the product side of the market is that run cuts will come, so I think everyone's kind of looking at their own kit, configuration will make those calls, but I think that that is something that will happen to rebalance the whole supply-side. That said, the demand side's been good. So, that's been the strength of it. We've definitely responded as a global industry with a lot more supply.","Blake Fernandez","Appreciate it, guys. Thank you.","Greg Garland","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey","Good morning, all.","Greg Garland","Hi, Paul.","Paul Sankey","Afternoon all. Afternoon and morning. The project on the Gulf Coast, the cracker, is that ahead of schedule or are we still looking at a sort of mid-2017 type start in?","Greg Garland","Yeah, Paul, there's two pieces of the cracker project. One is the derivatives project, the polyethylene plants at Sweeny and the second is the cracker at Baytown, which is just east of Houston. So, the derivatives plant, those projects are still online, they come online actually before the second half of 2017 to be complete, the cracker is now looking like it's going to complete in the second half of 2017. And that's really the change that we're seeing, primarily related to productivity and the complexity of that project we're seeing several month's delay. So, continue to progress on both of those very well, but the cracker is behind where we're seeing the derivatives project at this point.","Paul Sankey","Yes. Forgive me. I've somewhat lost track. But, I think originally, it was an end of 2017 start-up overall, wasn't it, or...","Greg Garland","We were thinking, probably start-up we were saying mid-2017...","Paul Sankey","You were...","Greg Garland","Yeah. We were, and so I think this from an ethylene standpoint, pushes it out in the second half of the year with the derivatives piece will be up earlier.","Paul Sankey","Understood. Are you implying the costs are higher than you had anticipated?","Greg Garland","I think, they're generally in line, but with the delay we'd expect maybe some increase in cost, but I think certainly well within the scope of what we're thinking, but I would anticipate that it's higher than what we had thought when we hit that mid-2016 or 2017.","Paul Sankey","And somewhat related, just a metric question that's also related to another business division, but what's your view of the NGL market here and the availability for those projects of cheap feed stocks and the general \u2013 and if you could just update us on your general view of what you're seeing in NGLs, that would be great. Thank you.","Timothy Taylor","Yeah. Okay. So, on the NGL side, we had pretty strong response in the second quarter. Ethane started coming out of rejection, but we've actually seen NGL prices begin to fall. And I think that the real key on this is, A, export demand and the pet-chem demand in the industry.","So, we're still seeing supply and we're still seeing ethane and rejection that's there to feed the new cracker start-up, so until there's cracker start-up on the ethane side, we think that will be the main driver. We're starting to pull more ethane out of the gas stream, which should strengthen the ethane price. On the propane side, we had strong exports and that's kept the propane market really connected to the international pricing in the international markets.","We saw some short-term cancellations I think this summer as really the differentials between the U.S. and some other markets start to close. We're starting to see corrections. And our view is that long-term, you still have excess length in both ethane and propane and propane has to lead the market to rebalance and clear.","And so, I think that what you see is, you just see the market start to readjust, and we're starting to see some of that now in the pricing this month in July. So, I think we're still, overall, still see a lot of value in that LPG value chain and the growing production as soon as crude oil production, gas production resumes out in the future.","Paul Sankey","Thank you.","Greg Garland","Yeah. The only thing I would add, Paul, just short-term, we think it's going to be pressured here in the back half of the year both crude and NGLs.","Paul Sankey","Yes, I know what you're saying. Thank you.","Greg Garland","Okay. Take care.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead.","Jeffery Dietert","Good morning or good afternoon, I guess.","Greg Garland","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffery Dietert","Depends on where you are. On the Refining side, you've got a diverse portfolio across multiple regions and different types of refineries. Could you talk about which regions, which types of refineries might be most impacted as far as refinery runs in the type of market environment that we're in now?","Timothy Taylor","Yeah, Jeff, this is Tim. I think, fundamentally, simpler refineries that run on light sweet crudes are going to be the most impacted. Clearly, there's been a sustained differential on the heavy light side, the bias toward the heavy, medium crudes are pretty available. So, I think that as you think about the system, we would expect the heavier oriented refineries to be very competitive and the pinch point comes on the lighter refineries around the globe and then that depends a lot on their configuration as well. And clearly, as usual, if you think around the world the Atlantic Basin is going to be a pitch point and possibly some of the operations in Asia, as we think about that.","Jeffery Dietert","Secondly, Marketing and Specialty performance was stronger than we had anticipated. Could you talk a little bit about the strength in that segment, maybe categorize some of the seasonal strength, some of the RINs influence, and maybe just comment on what some of the stronger aspects were in that segment?","Timothy Taylor","Well, it begins basically with good demand, right? You've got good pull-through in terms of demand, the response that we've seen globally by the consumer certainly in the U.S. Our volumes were up across some of the same store sides roughly 2.5%, so we produce more, we actually move into the market. So, I think it reflects the strength on demand side and so we were able to capture a little better margin in terms of the value, if you will, of our distribution wholesale market. So, I think it speaks to strength there.","The RINs are always interesting in terms of what's the impact in terms of the cost and the capture as it moves with the price, but I think that could bias into the price of the product as well. And I think we're able to capture some of that is certainly shows up as a cost in Refining, but it's a tailwind as well. You generate the RIN in marketing. But, fundamentally, the spread, the wholesale margin was improved and I think that really reflects in our mind, the strength of the consumer gasoline market. Distillate remains rather flattish from our perspective.","Jeffery Dietert","You mentioned product exports, 174,000 barrels a day in a quarter, which was a strong quarter for exports. Maybe a quick comment on that and I'll let you go.","Timothy Taylor","Well, we were able to bring up exports about 50,000 barrels a day, good opportunity. And so, I think, we just look at the decision as a better inland placement or an export sale. Clearly, the Gulf Coast for us is a big piece of that. And we're very well positioned to supply the demand in Latin America as we've seen some reduction in the run rates down there, so it was a good market and then you had the RIN value on top of that, it provides some incentive as well. So, I think the export markets will likely stay strong for U.S. refiners on the Gulf Coast.","Jeffery Dietert","Thank you.","Greg Garland","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. I think this morning it's amazing how much controversy thus is causing this quarter. Good morning, guys.","Greg Garland","Hey, Doug.","Doug Leggate","Greg, I wonder if I could ask first of all about a decision to defer the second cracker. Can you explain for us a little bit, has that been driven by yourselves, your partners? What was the basis of the decision there? And maybe now that you don't have the associated capital, when you expect a free cash flow swing to be on CPChem next year?","Greg Garland","So, let me just clarify a point. It was the frac two we've deferred, not the second cracker, although we can certainly talk about the second cracker and the timing on the second cracker today too.","Doug Leggate","I see. Sorry.","Greg Garland","And if, Tim, you want to talk about the cracker, go ahead.","Doug Leggate","I apologize. That's what I was referring to, yes.","Timothy Taylor","Yeah. We actually continue to do engineering work, do site studies. Still like North America and we think about the long-term supply, we look around the world for that, but I don't see FID on that cracker until sometime 2018, 2019, just as we do development work and look at things.","So to the second part of your question, so next year capital spending at CPChem will decline with the completion of the first cracker, so that may be in the order of $1 billion a year on that. And then in 2018, as you ramp up the production on the new cracker, you're likely to see at the CPChem level, this is both of those numbers, another $800 million to $1 billion with some upside depending on how the market is. So substantial cash flow swing at CPChem if you think about free cash flow. And so we're anticipating that we'll get strong distributions back from CPChem here beginning particularly in 2018.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the clarity. Apologies for my confusion. I guess what I was thinking was that when you talk about the swing to a positive dividend, I'd always assumed that the capital for the second project would start in 2017. I didn't realize the timing had been pushed. So, that in dollars that you're talking about, is that a gross number at the CPChem level?","Timothy Taylor","Yeah, that's a change roughly just from the cracker impacts.","Doug Leggate","Got it. Thank you. My follow-up, if I may is really going back to the capital question broadly. It seems you're maintaining the return of capital to shareholders whereas the capital seems to be taking the flex on the environment. I'm just wondering, is that the right interpretation going forward? In other words, how do you see your buyback strategy as it relates to use of proceeds from future PSXP equity sales and dropdowns and so on? Is that something we should expect to be ratable?","Greg Garland","So, let me kind of bisect that and talk about them both. I think that we've said, in terms of the capital spend at PSX, we've always been on a glide slope towards $3 billion. There's no question our capital the last two years has been very high as we've tried to advance the Midstream business and get PSXP to scale quickly. So, that was the decision we took really kind of end of 2012, coming into 2013.","When we think about share repurchase, we think about intrinsic value, and as long as the shares are trading below intrinsic value, we're going to be in the market buying. So we're in the market every day buying. Some days we buy more than others, that's true. And I'd say, consistent with our guidance that we've been giving in 2016, we're going to be between $1 billion and $2 billion of share repurchases this year.","Doug Leggate","Is there an outlook you can give for 2017, Greg?","Greg Garland","We haven't given our outlook on that, but I would say we'll probably be within that same range in terms of share repurchase for 2017.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you.","Greg Garland","Absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward Westlake","Yeah. First a small one. Just in the quarter \u2013 good morning, everyone \u2013 the cash flow ex-working capital obviously was weak. What would be the three things, aside from, I guess, refining margins that you'd point to?","Kevin Mitchell","Yeah, Ed, this is Kevin. So bear in mind that the almost $350 million of undistributed equity earnings, so that's reflected in the earnings number, but the distributions aren't coming back. The bulk of that is in CPChem, but you also see it at WRB JV, XL power lubes and then there's several other smaller JVs.","Some of those, it's reflective of the investment that's taking place inside of those JVs, that's consuming that cash. Some of it, a portion is just a timing effect that distributions aren't necessarily ratable. So when you think about the $560 million of cash flow, excluding working capital, if you were to add back the undistributed equity earnings, to put it on a consistent basis, that's just over $900 million of operating cash flow, which then lines up with what you'd expect from the earnings generated given the environment.","Edward Westlake","All right. Okay. And then I do want to touch on NGL frac two. So, is that just a function of matching upstream customer plans? Is it because cash flow in the short-term is a little bit weaker because of Refining or is it because there's maybe better things to do out in the broader MLP space given you've got PSXP and obviously your own balance sheet that you could use?","Greg Garland","Well, I think, I mean, we've always consistently said we'd never build a speculative frac. And I think our view is that NGLs will continue to grow, but they're going to grow slower than what we thought two years ago. And so, I think that decision to push the FID on frac two simply reflects that, Ed.","Edward Westlake","Right. Okay. And then a broader comment then on the second part of that around the opportunity set to look at inorganic growth across the portfolio in the MLP land.","Greg Garland","Yeah. I think, I mean, that's always something we look at every day in terms of inorganic growth. The other thing I would say is, we think we still have a pretty good backlog of organic projects that we can invest in around our own infrastructure, whether it's more terminals, butane blending, ethanol blending, more pipes. So, I think that just around the portfolio we still have a really good backlog of investable opportunities for the MLP. There's no question, when you think about the long-haul third-party, whether they're crude pipes or NGL pipes or fracs, I think those opportunities are probably diminished versus what we thought two years ago.","Edward Westlake","Thank you.","Timothy Taylor","Yeah, and Ed, just to comment, we purchased additional small interest in Explorer pipeline as one of the opportunities we look at is inorganic, but that's a pipeline we've been \u2013 it's in PSXP today, but predecessor to PSXP, Phillips, we've been investors in that pipe for a long time. So, it fits strategically. But I think those are kinds of inorganic bolt-ons that we look at that say they can add value and they fit strategically with our overall footprint at PSX and PSXP.","Edward Westlake","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read","Good morning.","Greg Garland","Hey, Roger.","Roger Read","I guess coming back to some of the cash flow questions, obviously PSXP is a significant contributor year-to-date and would expect so going forward. Any way to think about what the contributions from that to the overall PSX cash flow statement should be as we look out through 2017?","Timothy Taylor","Yeah. Roger, it's Tim. So, if you look back in history and you think about our spend, we anticipate about $2 billion a year of funding or purchases, if you will, at PSXP. To the extent that those are PSX, it's a project, just what we do. But I think, that's kind of \u2013 to meet our target on distribution growth and our plan to hit the $1.1 billion of PSXP, you're kind of roughly in that $2 billion a year range of purchases. So, that will be a source that equity and debt financing that will finance that.","Roger Read","Okay. And so, I'm just trying to think from a modeling standpoint, we could essentially assume a majority of that being available to PSX, but probably not wise to consider 100% of it?","Timothy Taylor","Yeah. I mean, the majority of \u2013 we have a large backlog organic that we're developing that would fit logically in the MLP, so that's been the strong connection so far with smaller bolt-on outside inorganic; but, yeah, so the majority of that I think you can think about as PSX and \u2013 but we're always looking at opportunities to add to the value through outside opportunities as well.","Roger Read","Okay. Great. And then what...","Greg Garland","Roger, we're at a run rate EBITDA of about what $400 million at PSXP today, we feel really good by the end of 2018 being a run rate EBITDA of $1.1 billion. We see a clear path to get there and don't see an issue at all in getting there.","Roger Read","Perfect. And then my other question, and this kind of ties back into the run-cut question and the guidance of the mid-90%s and then in just the second quarter kind of undershooting on the expected \u2013 I guess, it's called maintenance expense or the turnaround expense. What specifically on the maintenance side was deferred? And since the guidance makes it sound like it's a pretty modest amount of spending in Q3, I'm assuming deferred out of Q3. I was under the impression a lot of this is not something you can defer. So, I'm just sort of curious what changed in the operations on the Refining side and maybe do we have to think about 2017 as a higher turnaround year?","Timothy Taylor","So, basically our major maintenance turnaround is still on schedule, we planned. These are relatively small unit turnarounds that just were able to defer. So, they just move around sometimes on a planning basis; but the fundamentals, the way that we go about the major turnaround planning is unchanged, so I think our guidance where we typically get to on turnaround expense is pretty consistent year-on-year. Flexes a little bit depending on which refinery, but we've really haven't changed our philosophy on turnaround expenditures and timing of those.","Roger Read","Okay. Thank you.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brad Heffern","Hi, everyone.","Greg Garland","Hey, Brad.","Brad Heffern","I wanted to circle back on some of the CapEx conversations from earlier in the call, Greg, respecting that you said, you'll give more detail later this summer, I think. But, I'm curious why the CapEx is coming in so low? Obviously, you cited the frac two deferral, but I wouldn't think that there was any CapEx in the budget for that. It sounds like the major projects are on budget. So, what exactly is it that's leading to the lower numbers?","Greg Garland","Well, it's several projects in Midstream beyond frac two that we're looking at. I also mentioned the project financing of DAPL\/ETCOP. So, that's going to be a very classic type project finance. So, our share of that will be somewhere around $600 million-ish, I would say. Probably most of it will be in 2016, maybe a little bit spilled over in 2017, but if you could just kind of sum all that up and that's really how you get to a $3.3 billion level. And frankly, we're still working the numbers and I suspect it's going to come in below $3.3 billion, when we give you guidance in a couple months.","Brad Heffern","Okay. Thanks for that. And then I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the dynamics in the Atlantic Basin on the Refining side right now? Obviously, the arm has been opened, but it seems like products going nowhere but in the tanks on the East Coast. So, something seems to have to give on the Refining utilization side, and since you guys see both sides of the market there, how do you see that playing out?","Timothy Taylor","Yeah. You're right. We've had a lot of build of inventory in pad one in New York Harbor, there's been an incentive on Europe to continue to run that reflects storage economics right now. But, there is a place that needs to rebalance, somewhere between the U.S. East Coast and some of the European refiners, we still look at that, say there needs to be some balancing on the inventory side or the production side to balance that out. And that typically tends to be a more marginal or higher cost area, another reason we think about that.","So a lot of dynamics in play around that and we'll have to see how it shakes out, but no matter how you cut it, some plays, you've got to get the production and demand back in balance a bit more on the Refining side, so that's why we anticipate that run cuts come and that would seem to be one of the places that we look at that think that could occur.","Brad Heffern","Okay. Thanks. And then quickly kind of related, is there any update on Whitegate? Is that still in the sale process?","Greg Garland","So, I would say, we're still in the process on Whitegate, I would tell you we're pleased with the progress to this point. And hopefully, as I said, I think on last quarter, our intention is we get this closed this year.","Brad Heffern","Okay. Thanks.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd","Great. Thanks. Maybe just one \u2013 a follow-up question regarding some of the PSX and PSXP strategy. Just curious as to whether organic cash flow business at the base business, if you were to continue to see weakness in Refining of the Midstream or so on through 3Q and 4Q, does the level of organic cash flow accelerate or change the pace at all of PSXP drops in terms of how you see the timing play out in 2016?","Timothy Taylor","No, I think, again, we look at PSXP, we've talked about our $1.1 billion target, you've got to continue to progress to make the distribution coverage, so we have a strong backlog of MLP-able income available, and so we're going to continue to grow that, hit our target there in 2018. So, we're continuing to see good Midstream cash flows in our fee-based assets and that's a key component of what we want PSXP to do.","Ryan Todd","Okay. Thanks. So, then, maybe just one on M&A. In your strategic update portion of the note, you hint that you're evaluating all parts of your portfolio, which is something I hadn't seen in prior releases. I guess, can you expand any more on that? Things that you're looking at in the portfolio? Would you be considering selling anything that's in the portfolio? And, if so, is there anything you can comment in terms of non-core things that might potentially be on the table?","Greg Garland","Yeah, I think, my comments earlier were around the capital budget and the projects that we have on deck and ensuring that any project we do meets our hurdle rate expectations.","In terms of the overall portfolio, of course, we have the process on Whitegate, we just talked about; but I think as we come to the end of the Whitegate process, I don't think there is a lot more in portfolio that we have on deck, certainly for 2016 or thinking about it into 2017.","In terms of potential M&A, we look at every day, I would tell you that price is still relatively high to us, relative to the organic opportunities we may have in front of us. But, we would look at that. And if we can find assets for the right value, we're certainly willing to do that. I think the Explorer one was a good example, but that was done at the PSXP level. And in terms of Midstream, you'll see us doing more and more activity at the PSXP level.","Ryan Todd","Great. Thank you.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Faisel Khan","Hi, good afternoon and thank you for your time.","Greg Garland","Hey, Faisel.","Faisel Khan","Hi. Greg, I wanted to go back to \u2013 and Tim \u2013 your prepared comments around the Freeport Export facility. I think that is beginning the commissioning phase right now. If I remember right, I think the contracted volumes were, I think, six cargos a month. Just wanted to make sure I understood some of your commentary around that. I think you were talking about a lower number in the commissioning phase?","Timothy Taylor","Yeah. So, we're about 97% complete on the LPG Terminal. There's different pieces, so we're actually right at the front end of our commissioning and drying out process, getting it ready. So, we anticipate that will be operational toward the end of the year, but we are actually essentially completing construction and now working into the commissioning piece of that business, so that's about to become operational.","On the market side, and you asked about the contracts. We continue to work the contracts, as Greg said, the commodity environment is challenged today. So, I think that the commercial arm or opportunity is narrower than what we had originally planned in the short term, but we still fundamentally see that strength.","And as I said, it's got to clear the market here somewhere to really make everything balanced just based on the demand side. So, we feel pretty good about the longer-term fundamentals there with some stress short-term I think on the commercial side of that. But the load across that looks really solid to us. And we continue to work that.","Faisel Khan","Okay. Do the contracts support the ramp that you guys talked about, the $200 million to $400 million in EBITDA? Is that something \u2013 the current situation in the market doesn't impact sort of how we model those cash flows ramping up into the first half of next year.","Timothy Taylor","So, we've said that the EBITDA on that project $400 million to $500 million, 20% or so, would be commercial opportunities. And so, the ramp up schedule really relates more to the fee. And I think that what we're seeing is that opportunities for that are going to be a bit lower, but in the commercial arm is really where we're seeing most of the compression in terms of that run rate; but we're ready to ramp up when that thing becomes operational as these contracts start to kick in and we get the asset in play. But that takes a bit of time as you bring up the operation.","Faisel Khan","Okay. And on the Marketing and Specialty side, obviously that business continues to remain strong and generate high returns on capital. It looks like you're investing a little bit more capital in that business, if I'm looking at some of the commentary correctly. So, the upgrading of sites, buying more additional sites in Europe, and I was just wondering if you could comment about whether you are increasing the amount of capital into that business with sort of the addition of sites and sort of improvement of branded sites across your network?","Timothy Taylor","So, Faisel, most of that capital, the capital investment in sites is in Europe. We have a great market position, good return; but it's going to be modest, just given the size of the market and the rate at which it's growing. So, it's really, I think a level that we see continuing to go forward.","On the U.S. side, a little bit of capital on the Marketing side for that, but most of this is done through our dealers and our marketers, our customers. And so, it's part of our marketing structure, but making good progress in terms of revamping the sites, particularly on the 76 and the Phillips 66 brand, and we're seeing increased pull-through to the branded chain. So, we're strengthening that really through our marketing and commercial relationships versus a capital investment piece that we are driving.","Faisel Khan","Okay. And then last question from me. You guys talked about sort of the headwind from secondary product pricing during the quarter. Is most of that now resolved now that crude's flattened out and come off a bit? I just want to make sure \u2013 I understand that headwind is still continuing into the third quarter or has it completely been resolved?","Timothy Taylor","Yeah. Crude ran up quite a bit in the second quarter, and so as it comes off, the margin between say a coke and a crude, that that differential widens back out. That said, some of the other products are LPGs. And to the extent that NGL prices \u2013 I mean, propane price has come down significantly here recently. And so as you see that, it's a moving target; but generally, we do better with lower crude prices in terms of the secondary product loss, if you will. So that narrows and it's basically a boost or tailwind for our margins.","Faisel Khan","Okay. Great. Thanks for the time.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng","Hey, guys.","Greg Garland","Hey, Paul.","Kevin Mitchell","Good morning.","Paul Cheng","Just curious, is there a number that you can share on the fractionator one that seems to come on stream late last year, what's the contribution in the second quarter? And also when the LPG Export Terminal up and running, should we assume that the entire Sweeny NGL hub is going to report under NGL business or that the LPG Terminal is going to be in the transportation segment?","Greg Garland","It should all be in NGL. Let me take a, maybe a 30,000-foot view on this question if I can, and then Tim can come in behind me and give you some of the details. So, I know you have a concern around this and we understand that. If I can just go to the 30,000-foot level and just talk about the Sweeny hub in general, we still think that that's a great project and we see value creation opportunity there.","If you think about NGL pipes coming out of the Permian and West Texas and the Eagle Ford and going by Sweeny. You think about world-class refining, world-class petrochemicals. We have the largest single site ethylene facility at Sweeny, we're building 1.2 million tons of polyethylene capacity, building the fractionator, we're building the caverns, we're building the interconnecting pipes to Bellevue and on to Freeport and then the 150,000 barrel a day LPG Export facility. So, we still like that concept and what we are creating there.","I think short-term what you're seeing in the market, there's going to be stress in the LPG side of it. The frac is running well, it's running to design limits. We're seeing certainly heavier feed than what we premised. And so, we're running about 80 a day at the frac today versus 100%, but it's completely loaded in the backend of the frac.","The other thing I would say is, as this project is coming up, we have a lot of project expenses that are hitting us beyond just the frac. So, think about the pipes and the caverns and the commissioning and the start-up of the LPG Export facility. So you should expect to see those costs continue through the end of 2016.","But when you talk about the frac itself, we dropped it, all of it, it's at PSXP today. The EBITDA is about $100 million, so $25 million a quarter. There's a little bit of leakage that goes to the non-controlling interest, so then you take that and bring it to the net income level. And that was more than offset by the project expenses we had and the seasonal trading activities that we had in our NGL business.","We're not worried about this whole NGL complex that we're building at Sweeny in terms of it coming up. And we're looking forward to getting the LPG Export up later this year, we'll start commissioning activities actually in the next couple weeks as we start thinking about that. So, I just want to say that we still really like this project a lot. And Tim, if you want to fill in anything I missed, you're welcome to do that.","Timothy Taylor","No, I think it really is about the total. And, Paul, it's a PSXP asset today. Greg said we're down a little bit with the ethane. The ethane comes out of rejection that comes up naturally. It also starts to load more of the pipe in the caverns that are there. So, relatively small contribution, but it's up and it's running a lot better. We had great operational improvement this second quarter and so that's what we're focused on. And then we've got to get this LPG up and get the entire value chain going on that one.","Paul Cheng","Kevin, do you have a number you can share? What is the RIN cost and [indiscernible] resell for the Refining segment? And what is the RIN benefit that embed in the Marketing segment in the second quarter?","Kevin Mitchell","No, Paul, we haven't disclosed our specific RIN costs in Refining or benefits in Marketing. But you highlight the situation, so we do have the RIN exposure in Refining. We have an offset in Marketing. Obviously as RIN prices increase, that's hurting Refining more, and you see that reflected in our capture rates, but there's offset in Marketing. But we don't provide the actual numbers.","Paul Cheng","All right. And in the page nine of your presentation as you guys go through that was mentioning that the inventory impact on the margin capture rate. Can you elaborate what exactly where you talking about here?","Kevin Mitchell","So to the extent there is an inventory impact in our capture, it's reflected in that other bar. The actual effect in the quarter was...","Paul Cheng","No, I understand. I just think that you mentioned that that bar is relate to inventory impact. So, I'm just trying to understand what is that impact. What's causing that impact or that how big is that? That number is serious. Over $2 per barrel is a pretty big number.","Kevin Mitchell","Yeah. So it's a combination of your RINs expense, product differentials, outbound freight costs, any inventory effect, they're all in there. And inventory is normal.","Paul Cheng","Sure. I understand. So the inventory is not a major cause on that one?","Greg Garland","No.","Kevin Mitchell","No.","Paul Cheng","Okay. And Tim, when you run through your LP, is Bayway or Whitegate or Alliance, those [indiscernible] refinery, is it still make sense to run that through or that you actually look like that you should doing some run cut?","Timothy Taylor","Yeah. We don't disclose individuals; but yeah, as I made the comment, we think about it and look at the light suites and say where would that incrementally be in addition to product configuration. So rather than \u2013 just go ahead and say that we always look at that and we'll look at that and make sure that incremental barrel has incremental profit. And to the extent that we don't we'll crude cut the crew.","Paul Cheng","But you haven't seen it yet for those three facilities within your portfolio?","Timothy Taylor","No.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Thank you.","Greg Garland","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip Gresh","Yes, hi there. My first question is you talked about the $400 million of income at PSXP going to $1.1 billion. I just wanted to clarify, is that all, I guess, project-related EBITDA growth or is some of that drops? I guess what I mean is, I'm just trying to understand how much Midstream EBITDA growth you're expecting from 2016 to 2017, given that you have a lot of one-time costs that you're incurring this year to ramp the projects?","Timothy Taylor","So, with the $1.1 billion is a target of both existing assets, when we began as well as our growth projects. As we think about the composition, so exactly what we drop when is something that we always look at, so it's going to be a combination of both of those; but as you look at the Midstream EBITDA, we put out in 2018, we drove from around $1 billion say in, Refining and Midstream income when we started in 2013, 2014 pushing that up over $2 billion, so that's really the growth that's there \u2013 some of that's commodity as well. So, there's some \u2013 depending on the commodity markets, could be some of that about 20%. And that's really how we think about it is, that look through EBITDA, you've got $1 billion plus of EBITDA growth over that period, but what you put in the PSXP is a mixed question that we really don't address specifically.","Philip Gresh","Okay. So if I strike the PSXP part of it, do you have a view on how much EBITDA growth you'll get out of these midstream projects between 2016 and 2017? For example, the $400 million to $500 million from the Sweeny hub and the other projects.","Greg Garland","So, at the end of 2017, you put the Sweeny hub, you've got DAPL\/ETCOP, you've got Bayou Bridge coming on. So, you're pushing up well over probably $500 million of incremental EBITDA in the Midstream both the combination of PSXP as well as PSX.","Philip Gresh","Okay. Thanks. My second question is just for Kevin on the balance sheet. In the past, we've talked about whether you consolidated balance sheet or ex-PSXP. Generally curious how you're thinking about that today. And then, with this macro environment, we're seeing in the back half that could be potentially worse than the first half on free cash flow, general willingness to use the balance sheet in an interim period to continue buybacks, noting that 2Q buybacks were the lowest we've seen in a couple years?","Kevin Mitchell","So, debt to cap, 27% fully consolidated at the end of the second quarter. On a net basis, 22%. When you exclude PSXP, I think, it's 25% total. 19% on a net cash basis. So, it's still a fair amount of headroom from a balance sheet standpoint, balance sheet capacity to weather the ups and downs in the market.","Most of the capital programming, Greg talked about $3.9 billion capital budget coming to something $3.3 billion-ish for the year, but a lot of the capital is locked in and so that's where having the balance sheet capability to deal with that over that time period certainly helps us.","The MLP model is a critical part of the overall funding. So, as we continue to grow the MLP dropdown assets, you will see cash coming back to the PSX level and it's going to be in the form of, you'll see equity raises like within the second quarter and you'll see debt going on the MLP as well.","Greg Garland","Just one thing, Phil that I would add to that. We're kind of on a glide scope slope to $3 million and so think about $1 billion-ish of sustaining capital and $2 billion of growth, most of that growth is really directed towards Midstream and we fully expect that we can fund that coming out of the MLP.","Philip Gresh","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have now reached to the end of our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Rosy for closing remarks.","Rosy Zuklic","Thank you, Erica. And thank you all for your interest in Phillips 66. If you have additional questions, please feel free to give C.W. Mallon or myself a call. Thank you.","Greg Garland","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Please note, that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.","Jeff Dietert","Good morning, and welcome to the Phillips 66 third quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today's call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Mitchell, Executive Vice President and CFO.","The presentation material we will be using during the call can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 Web site, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our Q&A session.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our SEC filings.","Before I turn the call over to Greg, I'd like to point out a change in our question-and-answer session. Based on investor feedback on how to improve our call, and to allow everyone the opportunity to ask a question, we are asking that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If you have additional questions we ask you rejoin the queue.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg Garland for opening remarks.","Greg Garland","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Third quarter adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion, a record $3.10 per share. This quarter, we demonstrated the value of our integrated portfolio attributing strong earnings. In the central corridor, our Refining and Midstream assets ran at record levels, capturing strong margins. We continue to benefit from advantaged feedstocks as the industry's largest purchase of heavy Canadian crude. We achieved record Midstream earnings. And in Marketing, we realized solid margins on refined product sales. We've repurchased or exchanged nearly 30% of our initial shares outstanding over the last six years, contributing to our record adjusted earnings per share this quarter.","We continued our commitment to distributions by returning $775 million through dividends and share repurchase in the third quarter and $5.2 billion for the year. Strong shareholder distributions remain fundamental to our disciplined capital allocation approach. We're investing in a robust portfolio of projects with attractive returns to create shareholder value and drive future growth.","During the third quarter, Phillips 66 Partners once again achieved record adjusted EBITDA. PSXP has grown at a rapid pace during its first five years. With its scale and financial strength, PSXP is well positioned to fund and sustain a significant organic capital program to drive future EBITDA growth. Phillips 66 Partners is the operator and largest owner in the Grey Oak Pipeline project. Grey Oak will provide crude oil transportation from the Permian and the Eagle Ford to Texas Gulf Coast destinations, including our Sweeny Refinery. Supported by shipper commitments, the capacity of the pipeline will be 900,000 barrels per day, is on schedule to be in service by the end of 2019.","At the Sweeny Hub, we're building two 150,000 per day NGL fractionators, and adding 6 million barrels of storage at Phillips 66 Partners Clemens Caverns. We have agreements in place with multiple parties, including DCP Midstream, to supply Y-grade to the new fractionators. The Hub will have 400,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity, and 15 million barrels of storage when the expansion is completed in late 2020. Our Sweeny Hub is strategically located on the Texas Gulf Coast, and directly accessible from the Permian. Gulf Coast fractionation capacity remains tight, and there's strong interest from customers and future expansion projects.","At the Beaumont Terminal, we recently placed 900,000 barrels of fully contracted new crude oil storage into service. We're having additional crude tanks under construction that will increase the terminal's total capacity to 14.6 million barrels by the end of this year. During the third quarter, we had about 200,000 barrels per day of exports across our dock. The continued growth in domestic crude production is expected to result in the need for higher Gulf Coast exports, and we're making investments to capitalize on those opportunities. At Beaumont, we recently approved a new project to further increase crude storage by 2.2 million with completion anticipated in early 2020.","PSXP also has a 25% interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal under development in Corpus Christi. The terminal is connected to Grey Oak Pipeline, and will provide 3.4 million barrels of crude storage upon completion in late 2019. DCP Midstream continues to expand the Sand Hills Pipeline to meet the demand for growing NGL production in the Permian Basin. DCP increased the pipeline's capacity to 440,000 barrels per day at the end of the third quarter, and further expansion to 485,000 barrels per day is expected by the end of this year. Sand Hills is owned two-third by DCP and one-third by Phillips 66 Partners. In the high-growth DJ Basin, DCP's Mewbourn 3 gas processing plant started up in the third quarter. And the O'Connor 2 plant is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2019.","In Chemicals, CPChem has a leading position in polyethylene to supply the world's growing demand for polymers. CPChem's portfolio of cost-advantaged assets are strategically located in the U.S. and the Middle East. Abundant ethane supplies remain the cost advantage feedstock for U.S. Gulf Petrochemicals growth. CPChem continues to optimize its U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals assets, and is developing a second U.S. Gulf Coast project that would include ethylene and derivative capacity. CPChem is also evaluating additional capacity across multiple product lines to do bottlenecks on existing units.","In Refining, we continue to focus on high-return projects to improve margins. We have an FCC optimization project underway at the Sweeny Refinery that will increase the production of high-value petrochemical products and higher octane gasoline. This project should complete in mid 2020. At our Lake Charles Refinery, Phillips 66 Partners is constructing a 25,000 barrel per day isomerization unit. This new unit will increase production of higher octane gasoline blend components when completed in the third quarter of 2019.","We're opportunistic about future growth opportunities across our businesses. With growing hydrocarbon production in the shale plays we see opportunities for further midstream infrastructure build-out, including pipelines, export facilities, and NGL fractionation. Our refining system is well positioned to capture low-cost crude feedstock, and we see good opportunities for future chemicals expansion. We will remain a disciplined allocator of capital. We'll continue investing in growth projects with attractive returns that align with our long-term strategy, and we'll continue to provide a strong, competitive, growing dividend. And we'll be a buyer of our shares when they trade below intrinsic value.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financials.","Kevin Mitchell","Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on slide four, third quarter earnings were $1.5 billion. After excluding special items, adjusted earnings per share was $3.10. The third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 23%. Our year-to-date after-tax return on capital employed was 14%. Operating cash flow excluding working capital was $2.1 billion. Working capital impacts reduced cash flow by $1.5 billion. Distributions from equity affiliates were $910 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $779 million, with $537 million spent of growth projects. We ended the quarter with 461 million shares outstanding.","Slide five compares third quarter and second quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings increased $134 million driven by higher earnings in Marketing, Midstream, and Refining, partially offset by lower Chemicals results.","Slide six shows our Midstream adjusted net income, which was a record $261 million in the third quarter. Transportation adjusted net income for the quarter was $175 million, up $38 million from the previous quarter. The increase was due to higher volumes, increased pipeline tariffs and storage rates, and lower operating costs. Our operating pipelines in the central corridor benefited from strong utilization at our refineries. In addition, the Bakken Pipeline [technical difficulty] averaged more than 500,000 barrels per day. NGL and other adjusted net income was $64 million, an increase $14 million, reflecting increased Sand Hills and Southern Hills pipeline volumes and propane and butane trading activity.","Sand Hills pipeline throughput during the third quarter was a record $421,000 barrels per day. We continue to run well at the Sweeny hub. During the quarter, the export facility averaged 10 cargoes a month and the fractionator averaged 110% utilization. DCP Midstream adjusted net income of $22 million in the third quarter is up $7 million from the previous quarter due to increased pipeline volumes, higher NGL prices and improved hedging results.","Turning to Chemicals on slide seven, third quarter adjusted net income for the segment was $210 million, $52 million lower than the second quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins, adjusted net income decreased $70 million due to low margins from higher ethane feedstock costs. This was partially offset by higher polyethylene sales volumes as CPChem operated at 96% domestic polyethylene utilization and also grew from inventory.","Global O&P utilization was 91% in the third quarter reflecting planned turnaround activities and unplanned downtime from a third party power outage that impacted the Cedar Bayou facility. Adjusted net income for SA&S increased $9 million from improved margins. The $9 million increase in other mainly reflects the gain on an asset sale. During the third quarter, we received $325 million of cash distributions from CPChem.","Next on slide eight, we will cover Refining. Crude utilization was 93% compared with 100% in the second quarter. Our third quarter clean product yield was 84% and realized margin was $13.36 per barrel. Pre-tax turnaround costs were $55 million, a decrease of $5 million from the previous quarter.","The chart of slide eight provides a regional view of the change in refining's adjusted net income which increased $48 million in the third quarter. In the Atlantic basin, adjusted net income increased as the Humber Refinery returned to normal operations following a second quarter turnaround. This was partially offset by third quarter unplanned downtime at the Bayway Refinery.","Gulf Coast adjusted net income decreased due to narrowing heavy crude differentials and unplanned downtime at the Alliance Refinery. Adjusted net income in the central corridor was $633 million. An increase of $241 million reflecting improved heavy Canadian and Permian crude differentials and higher volumes. Third quarter capacity utilization was 108%. In the West Coast, the decrease was mainly due to a 25% decline in the gasoline market crack.","Slide nine covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the third quarter was $14.21 per barrel compared with $14.86 in the second quarter. Our realized margin for the third quarter was $13.36 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 94%, up from 83% in the second quarter. Market capture was impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries. We made less gasoline and more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack.","Losses from secondary products of $1.62 per barrel were lower than the previous quarter by $1.19 per barrel, primarily due to improved NGL and coke prices relative to crude oil. Feedstock improved realized margins by $2.50 per barrel, a decline of $0.65 from the prior quarter due to narrowing Gulf Coast heavy crude differentials, partially offset by improvements in the central corridor.","The other category includes impacts associated with product differentials, RINs, outgoing freight and inventory. This category improved realized margins by $0.26 per barrel. Let's move to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted third quarter net income was $290 million, $95 million higher than the second quarter. Marketing and Other increased $98 million due to higher realized margins in the U.S. and Europe, reflecting seasonally stronger market conditions.","U.S. branded marketing volumes increased 2% sequentially. We re-imaged $384 domestic marketing sites during the third quarter, bringing the total to over 2100 since the start of our program. Refine product exports in the third quarter were 190,000 barrels per day. Specialties adjusted net income decreased $3 million during the quarter from lower base oil margins. ","On slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment has adjusted net costs of $187 million, up slightly from the prior quarter. Lower interest expense was due to a second quarter debt repayment and higher capitalized interest. Corporate overhead increased primarily from employee severance costs and taxes.","Slide 12 highlights the year-to-date change in cash. We entered the year with $3.1 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Cash from operations excluding the impact of working capital was $5 billion. Working capital changes reduced cash flow by $1.6 billion. This reflects a $1.5 billion use in the third quarter due to an inventory build which included the impact of unplanned downtime at Bayway and Alliance, as well as the timing of crude cargo receipts and payments. We received $1.2 billion from the first quarter issuance of debt net of second quarter debt payments. During the year, we funded $1.6 billion of capital expenditures and investments, and we returned $5.2 million to shareholders through the repurchase of shares and payment of dividends. Our ending cash balance was $924 million.","This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items for the fourth quarter. In Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid 90s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid 90s, and pretax turnaround expenses to be between $110 million and $130 million. We anticipate Corporate and Other costs to come in between $170 million and $190 million after tax.","In closing, next quarter we are changing our segment reporting to be on a pretax basis. Income taxes will only be reflected at the consolidated company level. This change will make our segment reporting more comparable to our peers.","With that, we'll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. As we open the call for questions, as to courtesy to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. [Operator Instructions]","Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Doug Terreson","Good morning everybody, and congratulations on another great result.","Greg Garland","Good morning, Doug.","Kevin Mitchell","Hi, Doug.","Doug Terreson","Greg, you guys have been a leader in the whole energy industry in pledging to balance your spending and distributions. And while it's worked very well for shareholders, it obviously starts with disciplined capital spending. And so on this point, while you may not have your specific guidance yet, I wanted to see if you could provide some color or maybe philosophy that you might have on capital spending for 2019 and beyond?","Greg Garland","Yes, we'll I'd start from the guidance we've given that long-term we want to reinvest 60% of cash from all sources back into the business, and 40% goes back to our shareholders, so a strong dividend and share repurchase. And see us deviating from that, Doug, over the longer-term. Any given year we could bounce around a little bit. This year is going to be hard to hit. We'll hit 60-40, but it's going to be the other way, given we're already at $5.1 billion of share repurchases for the year. But there's no question I think that we're working the capital budget for 2019 now, we go to our Board, in December, for approval. So I don't want to get too far out ahead of that.","So we got Grey Oak, and the fracs. And of course Grey Oak, even though it's a PSXP, it gets consolidated up into PSX. So at the consolidated level we're probably looking at something between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in '19. We'll tell you what the number is when the get to the Board in December. ","Doug Terreson","Sure. Thanks a lot, guys.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Neil Mehta","Hey guys, good morning. Congrats on a good quarter here. I had two quarter-specific questions, but also then want to see if we could extrapolate them forward. And so if I think about where the driver -- in fact, one of the big drivers of outperformance versus model, was it was in the mid-con n your central corridor business. So can you talk about how you see that outlook going into the fourth quarter, and into 2019 as well? And there are a lot of components to that question, so your views on Brent, WTI, Western Canadian crude, and also just gasoline margins in the region. And then I have a follow-up.","Greg Garland","Okay. That was five questions packed into one Neil, but we'll try to deal with it. So let me just start the high level and then I'll have Jeff step in and kind of give our views. So I think, first of all, no question large differentials on WCS, but also WTS differentials were strong in the quarter. We're able to capture that at Borger and to some degree into Ponca. And we ran really well, so 108% capacity utilization. So where we needed to run really well, we ran well and we were able to capture that opportunity. And I'll let Jeff comment on our future views in terms of WCS spreads.","Jeff Dietert","Yes, so PSX is the largest importer of Canadian crudes and we benefit from these wider discounts. Production growth is continuing to exceed; infrastructure development, production up roughly 300,000 barrels a day both in 2017, and 2018 with further growth coming in 2019 as well. The pipelines are full. Enbridge Line 3 is the next one lined up for year end next year. It's only 370,000 barrels a day incrementally. And then Keystone and Trans Mountain are kind of 2022 plus. For the time being the rails are full as well.","When you look at the DOE stats for Canadian imports, we've imported right at 200,000 barrels a day for the last four months. That looks to be about what we can do at this point as an industry. There are some long-term contracts that have been signed and we expect the rail capacity to increase later this year and really more so next year. Canadian storage is at record high levels and it typically rises during the fourth quarter. So things continue to be tight with Canadian differentials.","Neil Mehta","And then the other area was marketing. You guys put up very strong results. I guess, there's a seasonality element to that, but it seems like gasoline wholesale margin is holding as well. So talk about your view for the marketing and specialties business and can we carry some of the strength forward?","Jeff Dietert","Yes, so there is seasonal strength there. The third quarter has got July and August, two summer months with the Fourth of July and Labor Day weekend in there as well, versus only one summer month in the second quarter. And so there is a big seasonal component there. When you look at wholesale gasoline prices, they were relatively flat in the third quarter versus more volatility in the second quarter and it's easier to push through the margins in a more stable price environment. We had strong margins in Europe as well and so really strong performance overall for the marketing segment.","Kevin Mitchell","But Neil -- this is Kevin -- as you look into 4Q you would normally expect to see the demand will come off seasonally as it typically does. And so you would expect weaker results from that segment as you go into the fourth quarter from the third.","Neil Mehta","Makes sense. Thanks again guys.","Jeff Dietert","Thanks, Neil.","Operator","Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Roger Read","Yes, thanks, good morning and a very impressive quarter.","Greg Garland","Thanks, Roger.","Kevin Mitchell","Thanks, Roger.","Roger Read","Just to dive in here, maybe a little bit of a follow-up on Neil's question as we think about capturing the central corridor and throughputs. So should we generally think about it as it's a Hardesty price adjusted for transportation or is there a component of WCS you get, you know, south of the border, doesn't have a price? I'm just trying to think about it in margin capture potential over the next few quarters until crude by rail has an opportunity to maybe narrow the differentials up.","Greg Garland","So Roger, I think the easiest way to look at this is just on a quarter on quarter change in the Canadian heavy discount 2Q versus 3Q in this case and as we go into 4Q just compare the difference in the discount at Hardesty and factor that in. We do see about a 30-day lag. And so I think it makes sense to lag that a little bit as well. But the easiest way to look at that is just sequential changes.","Roger Read","All right. I appreciate it.","Greg Garland","The other thing I'd add is Roger, we have invested in infrastructure that allows us to capture that. So we have things at Hardesty, we've got commitments on pipes coming south. And so I think we're really well-positioned to capture that ARPU when it's there.","Roger Read","Great. Thanks. And then the unrelated follow-up, PSXP, obviously there's been some pressure on refining MLPs across the space. You're structured differently in terms of assets and the size of the business. Just wondering, are you seeing issues where you may ultimately roll PSXP up or that you need to do something about the IDR, I was just wondering how you're evaluating that business to time a little bit of change maybe overall in the sector?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes, that's right. I'd point out we're at a different spot than some of the ones that have rolled up. It's a billion dollar plus EBITDA, we've grown at a 30% compound annual growth rate, the distributions. On our call later this afternoon for PSXP, we're going to lay out a great organic portfolio of projects that's investable. We kind of made the pivot from a drop down story to organic growth story. PSXP on its own has substantial capacity to invest. And so, we just look at it as a vehicle to help us grow our midstream business. And so we like that component. We think PSXP is a strong entity and a valuable part of our portfolio. Now, IDRs this is certainly a topical question and I don't think we'd go a meeting that we don't get asked about IDRs and what are we going to do with IDRs.","I would say that we don't think that there's a constraint on growth created by the IDRs today. Although, we do acknowledge that there's a lifecycle to MLPs. We certainly understand that. I would say that the path to how you deal with IDRs is a well-worn path and well-understood by most people. And the only guide rails that we would put is we're certainly willing to deal with the IDRs at the appropriate time, but it's going to have to be in a manner that is fair to LP unit holders but also to the PSX shareholders. So we'll get the IDRs at some point.","Roger Read","All right. Thanks. I'll stick to the one in one.","Kevin Mitchell","Okay.","Operator","Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Phil Gresh","Yes, thank you. First question would just be on chemicals, Greg, obviously there's been some tightness here on the feedstock costs and there's been a little bit of pressure on the margin, on the product margin side as well. Maybe you could just talk about how you're viewing those fundamentals in 2019, how long it'll take to resolve some of the fractionation issues. Obviously, you're going to help contribute a bit to that recovery, but just any thoughts you have?","Greg Garland","Yes, well, I think, during the quarter, I think I had a wild ride, you know, in the high 30s more than doubled and went back down into the high 30s and it's below that today. And I think the industry just had a hard time keeping up with that. So it did cause some margin compression. And frankly, we always thought with the new unit that have come on, three so far, that there would be some compression in margins as these materials started hitting the market. I think that thing that we all missed was how quickly the frac capacity build up.","And it was really you know, that frac capacity going up that drove the ethane prices so quickly and rapidly. I think that KIMS did a great job of adjusting their feedstock slates and obviously by cracking more propane and then putting pressure on ethane and you saw the result on the ethane prices. But I think we're going to be at this tension point until we can get some more frac capacity on and we'll see some coming on in '19. There's two or three fracs coming on in '19 and then a couple of more fracs including our frac 2, frac 3, another 300,000 a day in '20. So I think as we move into '19 and '20, we'd start to resolve that issue around feedstock.","So in the interim what will happen is, I think the export price of propane, the feeling if you own ethane price and of course fuel value is always a core on ethane price. Our views are still 600,000 or more a day in rejection across the U.S. where there's plenty of ethane, we just need the frac capacity to get it out. And then finally I'd just say you know, as we look into '19, we're still constructive in terms of the margin outlook. Globally, we could see good demand growth, really, globally, but in the U.S., Europe and in Asia -- and we just like the supply and demand fundamentals that we see looking out into '19 and '20.","Phil Gresh","Okay. Great. Second question, I guess, this one would be for Kevin since you mentioned it in your prepared remarks. You talked about in secondary products that coke -- I presume that maybe that's needle coke was the contributor to that margin improvement if I looked in the Atlantic base and your secondary margins were really strong there. So maybe you could just elaborate on the contribution that you're getting there?","Kevin Mitchell","Yes. So it's a combination. It's not that you've got then NGL impact, the strong NGL prices, and you had improved pricing across all grades of coke, so petroleum coke, and coke, needle coke and so strong pricing across the board and so that all contributes to that, that's a secondary product impact.","Phil Gresh","Okay. And you feel that sustainable?","Kevin Mitchell","Well, that depends on where the markets go. I mean that category as if you look back over time. That moves around it can move around quite a bit in terms of the overall impact on capture, so it will move as market conditions do so.","Phil Gresh","Okay, it sounds good.","Kevin Mitchell","They were also down during that period of time and so that they're probably impacted that the amount of the positive direction on secondary products but I think the coke market globally has improved, there's no question around that. We have two refineries certainly like troughs in Humber they're probably most of impacted implements particularly by the specially grade cokes. The last two, three years we've been working to develop new markets for specially great cokes one of those is the anodes and lithium ion batteries and we've made good progress there and developing a new high valued market for us. Lot of the other specialty coke goes into our furnace production and that's tied with the global economy and so you have to answer the questions as sustainable or not have become common and he continues to do well.","I think this business will between you do well for us but if it's a relatively small component in the overall mix for gold 66 it was completely overshadowed by the margin improvement we saw on the central quarter around, you think about billings, you think about Wood River and [indiscernible] $25 spread there.","Greg Garland","Bill, I think it's important to note that we have multiple grades of needle coke for many different applications and depending on the grade, the quality, the makeup of the needle coke. They trade at different prices. In addition for commercial reasons we don't disclose the duration of our sales contracts which can influence the prices that we capture.","Phil Gresh","Appreciate it. Thank you for the initial color.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Paul Sankey from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey","Thank you, good morning. Hi guys. Could we take a little bit more about chemicals, I thought what they would actually be that weaker then the results that you achieved, could you just give us an outlook for both volumes and margins your best guess that would be great. Thanks.","Greg Garland","Well, specifically to that third quarter, we had to turnaround at quarter author on the ethylene side but we're selling out of inventory. Ethylene inventories are still relatively high and that's also leading at some of the margin compression we're seen in ethylene. I don't when see becomes a case, but actually built inventory to cover the derivatives start up from last fall to the new cracker came on and the new cracker came on better, quicker and ran higher rates than we expected and so we've been adjusting inventories and so became to bring that when inventories down. So then you come back and you think about okay, what's happening going into next year. The sales lines are still strong polyethylene sales volumes are up quarter-over-quarter we're seeing strong demand growth it really across all regions also. I would say we're constructive on the outlook for margins going into 2019.","Paul Sankey","Are you hitting maximum volumes is not correct in terms of your sales?","Greg Garland","I think they certainly the Middle East assets are running at capacity we had a global OMP rate of 91% but that was influenced by the put author turn around then we had a power outage at our Cedar Bayou facility which ticked down the new cracker and the old crackers Cedar Bayou, so that really impact operates but I would, we've given guidance kind of mid 90s for the fourth quarter and I think we feel pretty comfortable with that guidance.","Paul Sankey","Great. And then the follow up is just on gasoline, again the market exceeded our expectations which is little bit conference here to discuss generally in a rising price environment and that was anything to add on that if additionally you could talk little bit about what looks like a very weak gasoline markets at the moment whether that's transitory effect to already what's going on there. Thanks.","Greg Garland","Yes, I think as you look at New York Harbor gasoline train at $8 a barrel crack that's the weakest in two years in New York Harbor distillate strain $29 a barrel that's a seven year high, so we're definitely seeing that split seasonality is a big factor what they are VP change the change coming into the blending pool, gasoline inventories are high even relative to seasonal norms, what we're seeing is more pressure in the Atlantic basin especially on the European side of the Atlantic simple refining margins in Europe are negative and we are starting to see economic run cuts in Europe.","We are in the U.S. starting to see gasoline imports slow earlier this year they were running about 800,000 barrels a day and they fall into 500,000 barrels a day and recently only 300,000 barrels a day. In addition gasoline exports to South America are improving, you look at October 27 with 700,000 barrels a day were up over a 1 million barrels a day this year, so the other side of that equation with strong distillate is encouraging runs on the distillate side but really the U.S. is well-positioned relative to the international markets, when you think about attractive crude discounts, strong diesel demand in cracks. Low fuel and operating cost and competitive taxes that we enjoy here and as you look into 2019, 2020 we expect high complexity refining capacity to benefit from the IMO environment and higher runs for high complexity, lower runs for low complexity refining.","Paul Sankey","Correct, Jeff, that was extremely helpful her year maybe you should think about yourself that made? Thanks guys.","Greg Garland","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Actually going to do my questions and Paul just tossed out one so I'm going to hold up Jeff if I may and it's probably for you. There was as gasoline situations been an action waiting to happen given the strength of runs in the U.S. but my question is when you think about export of light sweet crude it was Gray Oak and capacity expanding on the Gulf Coast, along with the IMO in pipe for European refiners, in other words higher runs, combination seems to us to be another threat to gasoline in 2019 the higher runs, lighter yields. I'm just curious if you can offer your thoughts on how do you see the gasoline market improving in an IMO world next year or going into 2020 I guess.","Kevin Mitchell","Well, I think the gasoline market's going to be challenged through the winter months. I think as we shift into next year there's going to be a focused on emphasizing distillate yields in an effort to improve distillate yields with confidence that, that's a longer term event with IMO coming as opposed to the U.S. that really tries to maximize gasoline yield in the summer months. It's certainly possible that we could have maximizing diesel yields year around for the next number of years and so we're looking at those yields shifting as IMO approaches feedstock in FCC feedstock is a good Marine blending component which could have the impact of reducing FCC runs as well and shifting more product yield into distillate and added gasoline. I think that's how we get out of this, but gasoline's probably going to be soft through the winter months.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate it. I am only going to take the rest of the one offline, but my follow up is for Greg and Greg, you're going to hear this because I ask it every couple quarters I guess and it's clearly the split between the dividend and the buyback and I want be very specific and we agree with you that your stock is undervalued but you never tell us what your number is, we unfortunately have to publish our number, so we're kind of there now exposed sort to speak but the point is that you're not immune to the seasonality the weakness, the market weakness and all the rest of it. So my question is are your buybacks, are you committed to ratable buybacks, are you a bit more to selling and when you execute your buyback program and in this environment why wouldn't you swing the benefit of your diversified portfolio back towards more of a dividend cut than a buyback cut in terms of the cash, and I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Greg Garland","Well, so we've never contemplated cutting the dividend\u2026","Doug Leggate","No, no, no, what I mean is the split. When I say, \"Cut,\" I mean like that which way cuts in favor of dividends versus in favor of buybacks -- choice of phrase, sorry.","Greg Garland","It was a Scottish definition of got me, okay. Look, I think we've consistently kind of guided to $1 billion to $2 billion of share repurchase years of past couple of years. Obviously this year we had an opportunity in February to take a big swing with Berkshire, we did, but I think the guidance is still pretty good guidance going forward, what we look at this stock price every quarter. We have a grid, we reset that grid every quarter Doug, so in the past two weeks we've been buying a lot more stock and we would normally buy, the share price fell and I think you'd want us to do that but we look at that every quarter and as I think out into 2019 kind of that $1 billion to $2 billion consistent range of share purchases will be the guidance that will give for 2019 also.","Doug Leggate","Yes, I guess I was sort of looking for that desirability as well as looking for. Thanks a lot Greg.","Operator","Prashant Rao from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Prashant Rao","Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back on cash flows in particular cash flow from operations. One of the step ups that we saw queue on queue in the equity affiliate distributions and just to become being a more material part of GFFO, wanted to get a sense of I don't want to front run anything you're going to say on CSSP call, but maybe just sort of to get a sense of where that cadence could move as we sort of model cash flows going forward and think about, how much that could be an offset to any CapEx needs coming up on midstream and any further on in chemical.","Kevin Mitchell","Yes, this is Kevin. I mean fundamentally the way that what drives the distributions from the equity affiliates or the operating cash flows within the equity affiliate, less in the case of CPChem, WRB less the capital spending that they're undertaking at the, at that level at the JB level. In the midstream, it's a little bit different because most of those affiliates are distributing, most of their operating cash flow is not all and then the growth capital expansion capital is being funded by contributions back in to those entities. So you've seen a robust distribution so far this year so just over $900 million in the third quarter, the year-to-date through the third quarter is just over $2 billion of distributions coming out and so you think about WRB which both refineries have benefited very well from the overall crude differential environment that we're sitting in and WRB will essentially distribute most of its cash.","There's no incentive, neither owner is incentivized to have the partnership sit on more cash than it needs to fund it's ongoing operations, so that's part of it as WRB does well and so the cash distributions coming back will do so with CPChem, some of this has been a function of the capital spend has come off significantly with a big project complete that's all behind us now and so the capital spending program this year is quite a bit lower than it had been. And so they're in a position to continue with pretty healthy distributions. We had guided to perceive became $600 million to $800 million of distributions for the year we've done $725 million through the third quarter and it's certainly possible that could be another distribution coming in the fourth quarter, so pretty healthy outlook from that standpoint.","Prashant Rao","Okay, thank you very much. That's very helpful and then just a quick follow-up, Kevin, I apologize if you detail this in your prepared remarks, with the working capital swing that we saw in the quarter, should we expect most of that to reverse out next quarter, and so for the full year we sort of end up breakeven on that volatility, or if there is something -- anything that's sort of going to residual that we should be mindful of?","Kevin Mitchell","No, I think that's a reasonable assumption. It's always hard to get forecast working capital with too much precision given the amount of moving parts there are within that but high level we would expect that to reverse and so the full year working capital is something reasonably close to breakeven.","Prashant Rao","Okay, thanks very much for the time gentlemen.","Operator","Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng","Hey, guys. Two quick questions, first on the needle coke, is there any capability for you guys seem to short term say within the next six months or so have be able to increase the production on that and also that on the medium term, do you have any plan to increase the capacity?","Jeff Dietert","The refining -- the cook businesses is within the Humber Refinery and the Lake Charles refinery, so it shows up in our refining portfolio our refining segment. In that segment, we highlight the most important capital projects every year. And you've seen us with Wood River and Bayway FCCs with now the Sweeney FCC. We highlight all the large capital projects. And so, the fact that we haven't highlighted a large capital project; it's probably a reasonable assumption that there's not one.","Paul Cheng","Right, Jeff. Thank you for that, but I think needle coke is a function of that, what type of oil that you choose and going into the cooking into the cooker? So maybe I get you wrong, that if they cook these areas actually need to be specially designed because I don't think it is. But maybe that you guys can help me understand a little bit better?","Jeff Dietert","Well, we do have industry leading technology associated with needle coke production, it is a different process. And","so we are very unique in that regard.","Operator","Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Brad Heffern","Hey, good morning, everyone. Switching back to chemicals, I was wondering, you guys were a little more candid this quarter talking about progressing a second U.S. Gulf Coast project, can you give a sense of the timeline there when it could potentially see a fighting and so on?","Greg Garland","Well, as a joint decision with our partner, I think that timing we've kind of guided to kind of a late '19, early '20 type FID, we are progressing work around the site location, the permits required initial designed around that facility. But I still think that it's late 19 or early 2020 in terms of FID for that facility.","Brad Heffern","Okay, got it. Thanks. And then, I guess on the frac capacity side, I was wondering if you could just talk about sort of the path forward for NGL production in the U.S. over the next 6, 9 months when there is an incremental frac capacity in Mt. Bellevue. Do you guys see what grade is getting produced in the tanks or does it get rerouted to Conway or Appalachia or how do you see that playing out?","Greg Garland","Yes, it's going to be interesting to see how we move forward, we'll probably see rejection maintained at high levels of the gas plants as people attempt to you to ship and fractionate the heavier barrels. So I think that rejection will stay relatively high. I think this will encourage additional NGL pipeline capacity and additional fractionator capacity because supply is likely to continue to grow as we as we go forward, drilling activities continuing in the Permian. We are drilling 600 wells a month and only completing 400 wells a month. So the duck inventory is growing by 200 every month, once the infrastructure comes online, then those completions will accelerate in and fill the infrastructure. So I think we're going to add infrastructure, add supply then add infrastructure then add more supply. We are kind of in that cycle.","Brad Heffern","Okay. Appreciate the thought. Thanks.","Operator","Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Matthew Blair","Hey, good morning, everyone. I was intrigued by the comments of the bottleneck in existing chem's unit. Could you give a sense of just the general capacity that you'd be talking about here as well as the timing and also with some of these de-bottlenecks occur at your brand-new cracker in PE units?","Greg Garland","The answer is yes, I think we probably have room to de-bottleneck the new cracker. But we across the platform, I would say we have opportunities and some of the older assets through to do some additional de-bottlenecking. So we are not going to give a number today in terms of the volumes on that. But I think that CPChem has a great portfolio of opportunities kind of internal to the existing asset portfolio where they can get some more value out of those assets. As you know, the bottlenecks are the easiest ones to do highest returning projects typically in the portfolio, so we will prosecute those.","Matthew Blair","Right, right. And then over and refining, what were your Bakken rail volumes to Bayway if any, in the quarter and how would you expect this to potentially ramp going forward, do you see de-bottleneck is just a lack of the 117J railcars?","Greg Garland","Yes, we benefit from blocking differentials as an owner and shipper on the Bakken pipeline. We do rail volumes to both the East Coast and the West Coast. We haven't disclosed those specifically, we really don't talk about specific refinery feedstock procurement but we are seeing an acceleration and growth in the Bakken oil productions up over 200,000 barrels a day year-on-year, but it's actually accelerating it's up 75,000 barrels a day quarter-on-quarter. The pipelines are largely full, the rail logistics are tight, I think you are right with the new compliant railcars being a bottleneck there. We have had some heavy refining maintenance in the mid-continent this quarter which will lead up as we get into later in November and December but we do expect Bakken differentials to remain wide.","Matthew Blair","Thank you.","Greg Garland","Okay.","Operator","Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Manav Gupta","Hi guys, so PSX is one of the global leaders in cooking capacity given IMO indicating no chance of a delay, ignoring of the administration, would PSX be open to investing in any resin destruction or resin upgrade projects. I mean, and you look at the Sweeney Refinery location, it's right next to John's Creek. So you can source a lot more WCS there, so this could be a good candidate to build a Coker, so just wanted your views on it?","Greg Garland","Yes, yes so we are the global leader in coking capacity and we really achieve this through a number of previous investments and we are well positioned with our portfolio, higher diesel yields relative to our peers and significant hydro treating capacity, so our portfolio is really well positioned without significant future capital investment requirements for the IMO environment.","Manav Gupta","Okay. And a quick follow-up in the Mid-con, the fights DCS, did you actually increase an uptake on the Permian crew that help drive that big Delta up?","Greg Garland","So PSX benefits from discounts on Permian barrels and mortar refinery as well as transporting volume into the mid-continent and the U.S. Gulf Coast refineries as well. We also been benefited PSXP from the ownership and the 900,000 barrels a day grey pipeline and the South Texas gateway facility. So those were the primary beneficiaries of the wide Permian dish during the quarter.","Kevin Mitchell","Maybe also ran our first. We also ran our first train out of the Permian this year around to or this quarter around to.","Greg Garland","Beaumont.","Jeff Dietert","Beaumont.","Kevin Mitchell","Yes.","Greg Garland","So, I think we're doing everything we can around the portfolio to create value out of these opportunities.","Manav Gupta","Thank you, guys. Thank you so much.","Greg Garland","Okay.","Operator","Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Craig Shere","Good afternoon.","Greg Garland","Good afternoon.","Craig Shere","Picking up on Roger's PSXP question a bit, kind of apart from collapsing the NLP structure or worrying about the IDRs at this point, it seems a lot of industry peers have either gone one direction or the other in terms of to the extent they still have an NLP putting all their midstream down there and then of course the opposite which is just consolidating it all back to the parent, you still have substantial existing assets and major growth projects at the C-Corp and the midstream space, are you just comfortable having this kind of dual pronged Summit PSXP, Summit PSX approach or do you envision a longer-term kind of simplification around how to think about midstream?","Greg Garland","Well, first of all, you are right, we probably have 700 to 900 million EBIT at the PSX level, that's MOP qualifying EBITDA although 300 or so that resides in our array finding business today. We just don't see the need to do that, we have such a strong portfolio of organic opportunities investable at PSXP and it has a balancing and the capability to execute those projects that I suspect that it will be a longtime before we get to the need to do any drops, it gives us comfort that we have in there we need them, but I would just say we are comfortable with the structure, we think about PSXP is a vehicle to help grow our midstream business, I think we said many times, we will be very comfortable of all the investments we are making a mid-stream, could be executed to PSXP level. And indeed, we've grown from almost zero capital budget to $750 million this year. And this afternoon, we are going to tell you a budget over a billion dollars for PSXP over 2019. So you can see that the strategy is evolving. And so, it's doing what we needed to do in terms of helping us to grow our midstream business and we are comfortable with it.","Craig Shere","Fair enough. And my second question, can you all update a little bit on how the market is looking for incremental LPG export contracting opportunities?","Greg Garland","Well, so I would say that, our export terminal which was 150,000 barrels a day design we've demonstrated kind of 200,000 barrels a day we are running about 180,000 barrels a day. Our view, we're constructive on the export market growth for LPG's and indeed, when we look at all the NGLs coming at us, out of the Permian, Eagle Ford and the other basins, we are going to need to export LPG to clear the U.S. markets because the U.S. man just not going to grow fast enough to absorb that. So I think we are comfortable with the growth profile we see out there. I think a lot of people have questions around tariffs and what tariffs they are doing, what we are seeing as of the markets pivoting around the tariffs today. So we have the Chinese buyers that aren't necessarily shipping to China today.","And then maybe trade now for Gulf cargo but the markets working in our view at this point in time and I just think longer term we will certainly solve the tariff issue, so I don't think we are concerned about that on a medium to a long-term basis. So we like the profile, we see I think that the issue is that the asset from our view is still underperforming our expectations even at kind of these 180,000 to 200,000 barrels a day given where dock fees are, we think doc utilizations in the U.S. are still around 83%, 84%. Let's say, as we move into '19, we see those utilizations improving. We think the opportunity to earn fees will improve. But in this market today, I don't think we would be interested in taking a long-term contract at $0.06","Kevin Mitchell","From a domain perspective, we see continuing growth in the residential and commercial side for LPGs internationally, especially in Asia, as well as for chemical feedstocks.","Craig Shere","And just in summary, what would you think the a multi-year economic contracting market, could begin to return by second half '19?","Greg Garland","Yes, as utilization of the existing LPG export capability moves from the 80s to the over 90%, we expect that those margins will start to widen out across the dock. And there will eventually be a need for additional capacity which will push those margins up and offer some opportunity for contracting.","Operator","Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Christopher Sighinolfi","Hi, guys. Thanks for the added color this afternoon.","Greg Garland","Yes, thanks.","Christopher Sighinolfi","I just want to quickly circle back on CPChem, it was really helpful color on the inventory sales in the third quarter. And some of the outages power related complications you had encountered. But I guess, as we look into future periods and curious with regard to the inventories, as you mentioned, and as I get normalized, how that might shape the sales profile, I guess implicitly, what I'm asking is how much of that excess inventory that you talked about, having built up remains to be liquidated, and how might that shape, what we should think about 4Q?","Greg Garland","I think from an industry perspective, the excess inventory is really in ethylene part, not the derivative part of the chain.","Christopher Sighinolfi","Okay.","Greg Garland","So it's really people making adjustments on the ethylene production side to bring the ethylene inventories back into line. And I mean, when you look at, we look at the full chain margin. And so what you've seen is the margins really shifted into the derivatives over the last couple of quarters. And I mean, that's the value of being totally integrated from that perspective. But I suspect that as ethylene inventories kind of comeback to more normal, some of that margin shifts back into the ethylene side. But, from a CPChem perspective, they're kind of agnostic, because they, they capture that full value through the chain. And so, managing inventory is just part of good blocking and tackling and capital discipline around working capital. So I think that, what we fundamentally look at, we look at the Middle East, so the asset is running, this inventory is stacking up at the docks, it's not, it's kind of continues to be a strong buyer and inventory seem to be clearing through that system. And, of course, demand in the U.S. appears very good to us fundamentally.","So I just -- we are constructive in our outlook in 1920 and '21. And from a fundamental supply demand balance issue, we see increasing operating rates, which I think is constructive towards margin as we move forward in that business. And so, I think that the comments around inventory are really specific around kind of the third and fourth quarter. I think, as you get into '19, those start to clear out in terms of the ethylene slide side.","Christopher Sighinolfi","Okay, that's really helpful. I guess real quickly, just switching gears and I don't want to run from around the PSXP public. Two questions, as I said, on Gray Oak. One is the upside is initially targeted capacity to 900 from 800 is that purely just based on additional contract volumes superior or was there something else influencing it and then second is just as Enbridge provided any early indication, you is what it will do with it's an option. I guess, I'm asking the contact of your earlier comments regarding capital budgeting discussions with the board at this point or entering 4Q about, what '19 looks like?","Greg Garland","Yes, so I would say there're multiple parties involved and they uplift to 900,000 barrels a day. So the line we are building a 30-inch line regardless. And so, but it was nice to be able to farm up those commitments and it certainly Enbridge has an option to come in that option expires in November, I think. And so, I think by the fourth quarter you'll have visibility and where they decide to exercise that option or not. I hope they do. They are great partner, if they don't we are willing to keep their share. I say it's a great project. So you'll have some more insight into that. In fact, all the other people that have options to come in to Gray Oak have to do so by November. If I was going to bet your money on it, I think our ownership is going to be 42.25% because I think the people will exercise their options to come into the line, I know, I would.","Christopher Sighinolfi","Thanks.","Jeff Dietert","Thank you for your interest in -- all right, thank you for your interest in Phillips 66.

Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.","Jeff Dietert","Good morning and welcome to Phillips 66 first quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today\u2019s call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO and Kevin Mitchell, Executive Vice President and CFO. The presentation material we will be using during the call can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information.","Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our Q&A session. Actual results may differ materially from today\u2019s comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings. In order to allow everyone the opportunity to ask a question, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If you have additional questions, we ask you to rejoin the queue.","With that, I will turn the call over to Greg Garland for opening remarks.","Greg Garland","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $187 million or $0.40 per share. Our diversified portfolio delivered positive earnings in a weak market environment. Depressed gasoline margins and narrow heavy crude differentials significantly impacted our refining results. Refining operated at 84% capacity utilization, reflecting turnarounds at 5 refineries. We are also impacted by a higher than normal unplanned downtime.","During the quarter, we distributed $708 million to our shareholders. Disciplined capital allocation is fundamental to our strategy and we will continue to return capital to our shareholders. We expect to deliver another double-digit dividend increase this year. We continue to buyback shares when they trade below intrinsic value we are buying today. During the quarter, we advanced a robust portfolio of attractive projects across our businesses. At PSXP, we made progress on the Gray Oak Pipeline. This 900,000 barrel per day pipeline will transport crude oil from the Permian and Eagle Ford to Texas, Gulf Coast destinations. Construction continues on the 850 miles of pipeline and the 17 facilities.","We are experiencing cost pressures from higher steel prices, labor rates and right away. The total cost of the project is now expected to be approximately $2.7 billion. We have received all of the Army Corps of Engineers permits. We are on track to startup in the fourth quarter of this year. Phillips 66 Partners owns a 42.25% interest in the pipeline. Rail will connect with multiple terminals in Corpus Christi, including the South Texas Gateway Terminal, in which PSXP has a 25% ownership. Marine terminal will have two deepwater docks with initial storage capacity of about 7 million barrels and up to 800,000 barrels per day of throughput capacity. The project is expected to startup by mid 2020.","We had strong operations across our NGL value chain. Our Sweeny Hub achieved record operating performance in the first quarter at both the fractionator and the LPG export facility. With Freeport terminal\u2019s advantages, including fewer port delays, the hub is a well-positioned LPG export facility with a global customer base. We are expanding the Sweeny Hub with 250,000 barrel a day NGL fractionators and 6 million barrels of additional storage at Phillips 66 Partners, Clemens Caverns. The hub will have 400,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity and 15 million barrels of storage when the expansion is completed in the fourth quarter of 2020.","Beyond these ongoing projects, there is strong customer interest to support investment and additional fractionation capacity. The Sand Hills Pipeline, owned two-thirds by DCP and one-third by Phillips 66 Partners, supplies feedstock to the fractionators at the Sweeny Hub. During the quarter, the pipeline achieved record volumes of 494,000 barrels per day following its fourth quarter expansion. We are making investments at our Beaumont Terminal to capitalize on the continued growth in Gulf Coast crude exports. Construction is underway to increase crude storage by 2.2 million barrels. Upon completion, in early 2020, the terminal will have a total of 16.8 million barrels of crude and product storage capability.","In chemicals, CPChem increased the capacity of its new ethane cracker to 1.7 million tons per year, which is 15% above design. A second Gulf Coast project that would add ethylene and derivative capacity is under development. CPChem is also evaluating additional low cost, high return to bottleneck opportunities. In refining, we have an FCC upgrade project underway at Sweeny that will increase production of higher value petrochemical products and higher octane gasoline. This project is planned to be complete in the second quarter of 2020. At our Lake Charles Refinery, Phillips 66 Partners is constructing a 25,000 barrel per day isomerization unit to increase production of higher octane gasoline blend components. This unit is expected to be complete in the third quarter of this year.","We have a portfolio of renewable projects under development that leverage our existing infrastructure, supply network and capabilities. Waste fats, recycled cooking oils and other renewable feedstocks will be used for diesel production. We have a project underway at our Humber Refinery and we are developing a project at our Ferndale refinery. In Nevada, we have supply and off-take agreements with third-party facilities. We are also evaluating renewable fuel opportunities at our California refineries.","In closing, we are honored that 6 of our refineries were recently recognized by the AFPM for their 2018 safety performance. The Ponca City Refinery received a Distinguished Safety award. This is the highest annual safety award in our industry and the third year in a row that one of our refineries has received this honor. Ferndale, Los Angeles, Billings, Borger and Santa Maria sites were also recognized for their top tier safety excellence. In chemicals, AFPM recognized 5 CPChem facilities for industry leading safety performance. In Midstream, Phillips 66 and DCP Midstream received first place awards in their respective divisions from the Gas Processors Association for outstanding performance in 2018. We are very proud of our employees\u2019 commitment to safety and we would like to congratulate them on a job well done.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin to review the financials.","Kevin Mitchell","Thank You, Greg. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our first quarter financial results. Adjusted earnings were $187 million and adjusted earnings per share, was $0.40. Operating cash flow, excluding working capital, was $923 million. Adjusted capital spending for the quarter was $675 million, including $463 million on growth projects. We returned $708 million to shareholders through $364 million of dividends and $344 million of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 454 million shares outstanding.","Moving to Slide 5, this slide highlights the change in pre-tax income by segment from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings decreased $2.1 billion driven by lower results in refining and marketing. The first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21%.","Slide 6 shows our midstream results. First quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $316 million, a decrease of $93 million from the previous quarter. Transportation adjusted pre-tax income was $203 million, down $31 million from the previous quarter due to lower pipeline and terminal volumes driven by lower refinery utilization. NGL and other adjusted pre-tax income decreased $32 million from fourth quarter inventory impacts partially offset by higher Sweeny Hub results. We continue to run well at the Sweeny Hub. During the quarter, the Freeport LPG export facility loaded a record 11 cargoes per month on average and the Sweeny fractionator achieved record utilization of 120%. DCP Midstream adjusted pre-tax income of $23 million in the first quarter is down $30 million from the previous quarter due to fourth quarter hedging results partially offset by a decrease in operating costs.","Turning to chemicals on Slide 7, first quarter adjusted pre-tax income for the segment was $227 million, $75 million higher than the fourth quarter. Olefins and polyolefins adjusted pre-tax income was $219 million, up $61 million from the previous quarter. The increase reflects lower operating costs driven by fourth quarter turnaround and maintenance activity and higher polyethylene sales volumes partially offset by lower margins. Global O&P utilization was 98%. Adjusted pre-tax income for SA&S increased $10 million driven by higher earnings from international equity affiliates. During the fourth quarter, we received $200 million of cash distributions from CPChem.","Next on Slide 8, we will cover refining. Crude utilization was 84% compared with 99% in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, we had turnarounds at our Sweeny, Ponca City, Lake Charles, Borger and Humber refineries. In addition, there was unplanned downtime at the Bayway, Wood River and Los Angeles refineries. These facilities are now back online. The clean product yield was 85% and pre-tax turnaround costs were $148 million. The chart on Slide 8 provides a regional view of the change in adjusted pre-tax income, which decreased $2.2 billion with lower results in all regions. The decrease is due to lower realized margins and volumes. Realized margins were down 56% to $7.23 per barrel in the first quarter driven by narrowing inland crude differentials and lower clean product realizations in a rising price environment.","Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3-2-1 market crack for the first quarter was $9.77 per barrel compared to $9.11 per barrel in the fourth quarter. Our realized margin was $7.23 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 74%. Market capture was impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We make less gasoline and more distillate than premised in the 3-2-1 market crack. Losses from secondary products of $0.63 per barrel increased by $0.34 per barrel from the previous quarter due to declining NGL prices relative to crude. Advantage feedstock improved realized margins by $2.08 per barrel, which was $1.71 per barrel lower than the prior quarter due to narrowing Canadian crude differentials. The other category reduced realized margins by $3.73 per barrel in the first quarter due to clean product realizations, freight and RINs.","Moving to marketing and specialties on Slide 10, adjusted first quarter pre-tax income was $205 million, $387 million lower than the fourth quarter. Marketing and other decreased $390 million from lower domestic and international margins associated with sharply rising spot prices during the quarter. Fourth quarter results benefited from favorable international market conditions and falling spot prices. Refined product exports in the first quarter were 200,000 barrels per day. We re-imaged over 300 domestic branded sites during the first quarter bringing the total to approximately 2,900 since the start of our program.","Slide 11 shows the change in cash during the quarter. We entered the quarter with $3 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Cash from operations, excluding the impact of working capital, was $923 million. Working capital reduced cash flow by $1.4 billion primarily due to inventory builds. During the quarter, we funded $675 million of adjusted capital spending and returned $708 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our ending cash balance was $1.3 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results.","Next, I will cover a few outlook items for the second quarter. In chemicals, we expect the second quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In refining, we expect the second quarter crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and pre-tax turnaround expenses to be between $70 million and $90 million. We anticipate second quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $210 million and $240 million pre-tax.","With that, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Doug Terreson","Good morning, everybody.","Greg Garland","Good morning, Doug.","Kevin Mitchell","Good morning.","Doug Terreson","I have a fundamental question. Specifically, it looks like how sulfur fuel oil traded a couple of standard deviations expensive to Brent since 1998 this quarter due to a variety of factors, but it also seems like as we transition storage and demand declines really down by 2020 after the middle of year that we should see better spreads for this feedstock. So, my question regards how you expect the market for heavy sulfur products to evolve in the next couple of quarters? And then also how are you finding availability or access of heavy crudes supply given the reductions that we have seen from Iran, Venezuela, Canada, OPEC cuts etcetera, how are you guys managing that?","Jeff Dietert","Yes. Thanks, Doug. We are continuing to have access to the heavy crudes and the overall crude slate that we need to operate. As you know, we have not been buying Venezuelan crudes since 2017 and the Iranian crudes really go to Asia. And so we are continuing to see availability there. As we look at high sulfur fuel oil, you are right with the OPEC cuts much of which was heavy and medium sour crudes with the Venezuelan barrels off the market and the Iranian barrels off the market due to sanctions. We have seen a tightening of the forward curve for high sulfur fuel oil. If you look back 6 to 9 months ago, the forward curve for 2020 was trading about $12 a barrel wider than the 10-year historical discount. Today, it\u2019s closer to a $5 additional discount. We do expect as we move into the back part of the year, we are expecting to start converting tanks to compliant fuel in September and October. A number of the shipping companies have talked about starting to buy compliant fuel and testing it in the fourth quarter. So, we expect those differentials to widen as we hit some of those points in the year.","Doug Terreson","Okay. Thanks, Jeff.","Jeff Dietert","Thank you.","Operator","Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Neil Mehta","Good morning, team. So, the back half of 2018 was really an exceptional period for operational performance. The same can\u2019t be said for the first quarter, lot of planned, but a lot of unplanned outages. So, I just wanted to get your temperature on operational excellence and how you feel about the go-forward from here?","Greg Garland","Yes. Well, Neil, I think, Garland, first of all, we ran lights out in the fourth quarter, but I think we have run kind of rugged in the first quarter. Obviously, we had 8% kind of planned maintenance turnaround activity. It was factored and planned and we had about 6% give or take of kind of unplanned downtime, which is uncharacteristic for us. We would normally target about 2% unplanned downtime during the quarter. I think as Kevin mentioned in his remarks, it\u2019s really around three facilities, Wood River, we are coming up from a turnaround issue restarting the crude unit lineup issue, had a pump failure at Los Angeles, both resulted at substantial downtime of both those facilities. And then Bayway, we upgraded the FCC we brought that on the new unit online last year. It\u2019s kind of met the yield structure that we are looking for in terms of the sign bases. We have gotten the throughput through it. We have never really experienced the resiliency that we expected out of that unit. We had it up and down a couple of times in the third quarter. I think we have got a technical, it\u2019s up and running now, but you are right, so circa probably $150ish million of profit opportunities for us during the quarter.","Neil Mehta","So, that\u2019s helpful. And then the follow-up is on the midstream side, PSXP is one of the few MLPs that still has that IDR structure. And just your thoughts on if and when the right time is to sort of cleanup that structure given that it\u2019s certainly been a big focus from a corporate governance perspective for MLP investors?","Greg Garland","Yes, not an unusual question, Neil. I think we get that a lot. In fact, someone pointed out to me there is like 3 MLPs that have IDRs and we have two of them apparently. So I think that \u2013 look, I think for PSXP, we understand that MLPs and IDRs have a lifecycle. We also understand that from an investor perspective they will prefer us to do something with the IDR. So, I think that as we kind of think it through and we have always kind of use the guardrails, we have to do something that \u2013 it\u2019s accretive to do unitholders, so we don\u2019t really step on the unitholders punish them and we also do something that recognizes the value of the IDR to the PSX shareholder. So, I think we will thread that needle. One of the issues we have had is it\u2019s been a high growth MLP, you think about the cost of capital where we sit today, it really hasn\u2019t impeded the growth of PSXP, you are executing $1.2 billion of capital program at PSXP this year. So, it really hasn\u2019t impeded on the ability to grow the MLP, but we will get to it, we will get there at PSXP.","Neil Mehta","Appreciate it, guys.","Greg Garland","Thanks, Neil.","Operator","Phil Gresh from JPMorgan please go ahead. Your line is open.","Phil Gresh","Hi good morning.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Phil Gresh","First question just on chemicals, some of your peers have \u2013 it sounds like they are getting more cautious on the fundamental picture here in 2019 even in the 2020 in some cases. Curious what your latest thoughts are on chemical market fundamentals and how that may or may not impact your thoughts around the second cracker?","Greg Garland","Yes. So I will take a stab and Jeff or Kevin can come in and fill in. So you look at 2018 first half year really strong growth, slowing growth in the back half of \u201818. As we came into \u201819, we are expecting to grow albeit probably at a slower rate than what we experienced in 2018, against the backdrop of a three large cracker startups kind of in the U.S. in 2018 with the Dow cracker, the CPM cracker and the ExxonMobile cracker. As we look at where we sit today, I think we are constructive of the economy for 2019. Certainly, the first quarter GDP results look good to us for the U.S. Europe is showing signs of life. I think the stimulus is working in Asia, albeit we need to resolve the tariff issue, which we think was sometime early this summer with China. But having said all that, we have got two more big crackers coming at us late this year and early next year. So, I would say that maybe some more margin compression as we get in the back half of this year. But as you think out between now and 2023, there is more demand growth from us and there is supply additions coming on. So we are constructive in terms of the margin outlook. So, I would say good demand fundamentals in the petrochemicals business against the backdrop of some capacity coming on and we continue to like the CPChem position of advantaged feedstocks in the Middle East and the U.S. Gulf Coast. So I don\u2019t know Jeff or Kevin you guys want to fill in on that, but\u2026","Kevin Mitchell","No, I think fundamentally, it doesn\u2019t change our view on the next major capital project with CPChem as you think about that being a \u2013 you are building those assets for a multi-year investment in returns and that still is very attractive to us.","Greg Garland","I know that some of our peers have had a less than rosy outlook, but say their portfolios are different. They have more exposure in Europe and Asia than CPChem does. And so I still think CPChem is really well-positioned from a portfolio standpoint.","Jeff Dietert","If you look at the benefits of the U.S. ethane and we have got production continuing to grow rapidly, NGL is up over 500,000 barrels a day year-on-year and ethane is about half of that. We have had additional industry pipeline capacity added from the Permian to the Gulf Coast with more to come later this year and two additional fractionators coming on line. So, the supply advantages for ethane continue to look strong.","Phil Gresh","Thanks. Thanks for the answers. Just shifting gears to your comments there, Jeff around the NGL pipelines seeing a lot of buildup in propane on the Gulf Coast, propane inventories and you guys have been running pretty well at the LPG export facility and 11 cargos per month. How are you viewing the fundamental picture on the propane exports and margins given your exposure to that arb as we look here in the second half of the year? Is it sustainable in your view?","Jeff Dietert","Yes. I think there are reasons for optimism there. We\u2019re continuing to see strong Asian demand. As you know, we market to other parts of the world as well export facilities, LPG export facilities are running at pretty high utilization, which is helping margins. We\u2019ve seen the robust LPG production growth in the U.S. We did have some impact in the first quarter from Houston Ship Channel fog, but it looks to us the U.S. supply for LPGs is going to be very robust and that should support LPG exports.","Phil Gresh","Thank you.","Operator","Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Roger Read","Yes. Thank you. Good morning.","Jeff Dietert","Good morning, Roger.","Roger Read","I guess maybe if we could hit a little bit, the one other refiner that\u2019s reported so far mentioned that they were no longer at a max diesel mode. And I was wondering as you\u2019re looking at the summer and the better balance between gasoline and diesel margins, how you\u2019re set up for it for the near term here?","Jeff Dietert","Yes, we were in max diesel mode in the fourth quarter in the first quarter given the strength in diesel cracks relative to gasoline. It\u2019s really a factor of looking at our linear programs, which we run across the portfolio. Each refinery can run differently. We are seeing strength in gasoline cracks, especially in the West Coast. And so, we\u2019ve increased gasoline focus there, but we\u2019ll really be driven by the LPs and max feedstocks and yields as the year unfolds. In February, it looked like the industry was going to need to be in max diesel mode year-round. And now we\u2019re seeing some exceptions to that. So, we\u2019ll move with the market and make adjustments as necessary.","Roger Read","Yes, yes. Gasoline was going to be a byproduct, I remember. One other thing is slightly different from path from just the refining yield side, crude exports and all the crude pipelines coming to the coast obviously. I know and we\u2019ve talked before there\u2019s been discussions about from an infrastructure standpoint being involved in crude exports, not just at the port facilities, but these potential loadings of the VLCC. I was just wondering you know any update on that, anything you see there that\u2019s interesting or any thoughts on timing of when one of those VLCC loading ports might be available?","Jeff Dietert","As you know we\u2019re involved at Beaumont with crude and product exports. We\u2019re participating at Corpus Christi in the South Texas Gateway facility that will serve the Gray Oak Pipeline. We\u2019re continuing to look at VLCC opportunities, but we don\u2019t have anything to announce at this point.","Roger Read","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Blake Fernandez from Simmons Energy. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Blake Fernandez","Hi guys. Good morning. First question this probably goes to Kevin, but the cash flow was fairly strong in the quarter, at least compared to our expectations. If you strip out the working capital changes, it looks like part of that is due to some deferred income tax benefit, which is higher than normal. I didn\u2019t know if you could elaborate a little bit on how we should think about that going forward.","Kevin Mitchell","Yes. Blake, you\u2019re right. The deferred income tax benefit I think was a $179 million benefit on the cash flow statement this quarter. We think about that normally as being about $100 million a quarter of benefit and so you extrapolate that, I would say $400 million for the year and I would say that $400 million for the year is still where we would be. So, we had a couple of, sort of non-standard items, non-routine running through in the first quarter. So, you as you think about the rest of the year, I think you\u2019d still assume we get to that $400 level for the full year.","Blake Fernandez","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Jeff just going back to Doug\u2019s initial question on the heavies, I can appreciate that things are hopefully going to get better in the 4Q and the next year, but over the next quarter or two, it seems like the heavy market continues to be challenged. WCS is obviously fairly compressed and given the lagged impact of pricing, I didn\u2019t know if you could talk a little bit about do you have alternatives to shift away from WCS or is it just fair to think that\u2019s going to present a bit of a challenge from a capture rate standpoint in the near term? Thanks.","Jeff Dietert","Well, we do have alternatives to as we are away from WCS. WCS continues to work in many parts of our portfolio. I think as you look, we\u2019re probably in the peak of the Canadian production maintenance season right now. There are a number of production facilities that are down. We believe some of those have been accelerated into the second quarter because of the mandated cuts and we think that\u2019s going to peak this quarter and as we go into the second and third quarter, we\u2019ll have more production in the market. We expect we\u2019re probably to be close to pipeline economics in the second quarter and move toward rail economics in the back half of the year. When you look at the forward curve, it kind of reflects that expectation and so we think there\u2019s some temporary impacts and we\u2019ll see them wider in the fall.","Blake Fernandez","Thank you.","Operator","Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jeff Dietert","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Morning, Jeff. Morning, everyone. Appreciate you getting me on this morning. I got one micro and one specific on capital, if I may and I guess let me start off, anyone who wants to take this, but we start off with the micro. The gasoline obviously has staged a little bit of a recovery here. But last quarter yourself and pretty much all your peers were talking about remaining in max diesel mode as we kind of go through the summer. And I realize I am always part of this, but it seems to us that with the somewhat semi-permanent uplift in gasoline yield that could be kind of normal MO going forward, which frankly we see is quite constructive for gasoline. So, I\u2019m just curious, how you guys are thinking about this and if I could layer onto that your expectations for industry utilization given that we no longer have those windfall crudes spread. I\u2019ve got a full open in CapEx, please.","Jeff Dietert","Yes. So, I think if you look back to February and this speaks to the accuracy of the forward curve. But if you look in February gasoline cracks through the summer were in the $6 to $7 a barrel range in the forward curve, whereas today, they\u2019re $12 to $13 a barrel. So, there\u2019s been a substantial increase with the drawdown in inventories that have been experienced. Gasoline inventories were at an all-time high in late January and now they\u2019re back down below the five-year average. So, we\u2019ll adjust with those changes. We talked briefly about this, but we are seeing an increasing gasoline yield in California as gasoline cracks there have strengthened. And does that answer your question?","Doug Leggate","Yes, I think what I\u2019m really getting at is, last quarter gasoline was so bad obviously coming into the year and the expectation obviously is, I think some there\u2019s been some egregious assumptions obviously, but the expectation is diesel is going to be supported by the shift to IMO. So, I\u2019m just wondering if that means a deliberate bias, away from gasoline to the support of the gasoline market is really what I was getting at, but I take your point in the West Coast. I guess I\u2019m really thinking more about your industry outlook.","Jeff Dietert","Yes. So, the industry outlook, I think as we see an increase in demand for diesel associated with IMO, that\u2019s going to shift refiners into a max diesel mode year-round, which may have been what you were referring to. I think that may be more common going forward. I think the other thing is, we were in max diesel mode. I think as an industry in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, yeah diesel yields were only a 0.5% higher than previous. And so, as we look at that $2 million to $2.5 million barrels a day of incremental marine fuel demand, I\u2019m not sure how much of that is going to be diesel. I think a year ago, we thought most of that was going to be diesel. Now we may be required as an industry to pull some barrels out of the FCC in order to meet that marine fuel market. The FCCs have a 5% to 10% yield improvement across, which reducing FCC utilization would reduce gasoline supply and diesel supply as well. We don\u2019t see that happening in our portfolio. Our FCCs tend to be larger and more efficient. But there may be some in the oil that see a lower FCC utilization rate, which could support both the gasoline market and the diesel market frankly.","Doug Leggate","Jeff, I\u2019ve got a quick follow-up on CapEx, but I\u2019m delighted you brought that up because that\u2019s been our whole thesis on IMO getting a little ahead of itself. So, appreciate that. My follow-up is really just on CapEx. I realize you addressed Gray Oak on your remarks, but the things are running a little ahead of schedule for this year in terms of the spending cadence and obviously you had the big working capital situation. So, I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us our steer us how you see the net spending profile on the unwind of the working capital playing out through the balance of the year. Because obviously big part of your story remains the cash returns, we just want to see how resilient outlook is through the balance of 2019? I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Kevin Mitchell","Yes. Doug, it\u2019s Kevin. Really two elements to that around the CapEx and the working capital, let me hit on the working capital one first. The large working capital use of cash this quarter in the first quarter is pretty normal for us as we look at the timing of our inventory activity and it\u2019s we\u2019re usually building inventories in the first quarter and then over the course of the year and especially in the fourth quarter you\u2019ll see that coming back down. So, for the year as a whole, we still think of working capital being about flat and so you\u2019d expect to recover that $1.4 billion over the remaining quarters of the year keeping that flat. On CapEx I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve picked up on it, but on an adjusted basis, which is really the way to think about that is, our net cash outlay, we were $675 million for the quarter. So, if you extrapolate that out, that is very much in line with our consolidated budget of $2.9 billion. Greg talked about the increased cost on Gray Oak, but when you factor in our net share of that and what actually flows through into this year\u2019s spend, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to have a material impact at all on that $2.9 billion. So, at this point that the PSX level, we\u2019re not moving guidance on our capital, we\u2019re comfortable with where we are.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the clarity, Kevin and thanks again.","Kevin Mitchell","Thanks, Leggate.","Operator","Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Manav Gupta","Hey, guys. I have a IMO-related question. Yesterday, 5 Republican senators led by Bill Cassidy sent a letter to the President urging him to implement IMO 2020. There were a couple of lines in the letter, which kind of stood out. The first one was, Senator is telling the President timely implementation of IMO 2020 standards will bring tremendous advantage to our country. The second line was, any attempt by the U.S. to reverse course on IMO 2020 could create market uncertainty, cause harm to the U.S. energy industry. What I\u2019m trying to understand is, why was this letter actually sent. Is it because these Senators are building support for IMO 2020, because they see the benefits or is it because they\u2019re a little worried that the President actually might reverse the course here, you guys are very close to the ground? What are you seeing? Will we see a smooth implementation or do you think there is a possibility of some political risk here?","Jeff Dietert","Well, I think as you look at the different participants in the industry, the IMO itself insurance companies, banks the port announcement by the U.S. Coast Guard, which you highlighted previously, the courts in China and Singapore are all expressing intentions to strictly enforce IMO on its current timetable. So, I think the participants have been pretty consistent across the board. I think it\u2019s important to the IMO the benefits to the environment that are associated with the IMO. When you look at marine fuel, it\u2019s about 4% of global demand yet it\u2019s about 90% of sulfur emissions. And so, improving the environmental emissions is critical to the IMO and I think all signs are that we\u2019re moving forward with timely implementation here. One other thing I would mention, the IMO has its main meeting coming up and the agenda items are really focused on implementation.","Manav Gupta","Thanks, Jeff. Thanks for taking my question.","Jeff Dietert","Thanks, Manav.","Operator","Prashant Rao from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Prashant Rao","Hi, thanks for taking the question.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Prashant Rao","I wanted to \u2013 good morning, I wanted to ask a question on M&S. Appreciate that a lot of the headwind Q-on-Q was really timing and due to sort of crude prices within around and product inventory builds and all of that. I kind of wanted to get a sense of maybe how much of that now sort of reverses out as we go forward assuming crude prices are stable, and maybe related to that when we look to the fuel margins into the Q-on-Q progression, feels like international was a bit more steep step-down, and wondering if there\u2019s anything in there versus domestic to really call out and sort of whether that also sort of normalizes now this quarter and as we go through sort of the rest of the year?","Jeff Dietert","Yes. I think that\u2019s a good question. If you look at oil prices at the beginning of the fourth quarter and compared to the end of the fourth quarter, oil prices fell by 40%, that\u2019s the largest drop in a quarter in the last 5 years. So, there was a strong tailwind in marketing margins in the fourth quarter. As you move into the first quarter, going from Jan 1 to March 31, there was a 45% increase in crude prices and gasoline cracks widened during that period as well, and so those were strong headwinds for marketing during the first quarter. You are right on the international margins, in the fourth quarter there was refinery maintenance in the Rhine River. Levels were low, which limited logistics. Our marketing group was very successful maintaining their logistics in serving markets and benefited from wider margins during that period of time. As you look at the first quarter, it was somewhat similar to first quarter of \u201818 and first quarter of \u201817, except that it did have a bigger headwind on crude price rise relative to the first quarters of the previous years.","Kevin Mitchell","Well, Prashant, this is \u2013 yes, I was just going to add that as you look at where we sit in the second quarter, on the face of it, we should be back to a sort of more I\u2019d say normal level with \u2013 avoid the dramatic movement and flat price environment as we head into May and you start hitting the summer driving season, you\u2019d expect to see the more normal seasonal patterns kick in.","Prashant Rao","Okay. Thank you very much for the answers. Appreciate it.","Greg Garland","Thanks, Prashant.","Operator","Matthew Blair from Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Matthew Blair","Hey, good morning, Greg, Kevin, and Jeff. I want to circle back to the cost increase at Gray Oak. I think you highlighted steel and labor moving higher. Obviously, Phillips has a pretty robust organic growth slate. So, could you talk about the potential for cost inflation at some of your other projects like the fracs and your other pipes, and I guess potentially even in your refining and chems projects too?","Greg Garland","Yes, I\u2019ll start and then Jeff and Kevin can help me out. I think in Gray Oak, first of all, I mean, there\u2019s at least three pipelines kind of executing that same window. And so that has caused some of the escalations we\u2019ve seen around right-of-way acquisition. Certainly, the competition for labor in that execution window is also pretty intense around that. We repurchased most of the pipe itself. And then on the facilities, we had some exposure on the facilities and then I think as you looked at the complexity of the project and execution of that project around the facilities itself in a routing of where they need to be, we probably underestimated some of the facility costs in that original cost estimate. We move and we look at the fracs, they\u2019re on schedule, they\u2019re within budget, and so we\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019re not seeing those same cost pressures around our refining or other midstream projects, it seems to be just right around the Permian asset.","Matthew Blair ","Great, great. And then over on the chem side, so year-to-date, we\u2019ve obviously seen a pretty big increase in crude prices, but looking at like PE spot export prices, they\u2019ve hardly changed and maybe you could attribute that to high PE inventories or weak demand. But my question is are you expecting a catch-up on PE prices relative to crude or has something in your view structurally changed on this historical link between PE and crude?","Greg Garland","No, I think we\u2019re probably in our estimation maybe running a little bit behind in terms of moving prices globally. I think there\u2019s a lot of factors in there. I think that the Chinese tariffs are definitely a weight on that. There is consultants out there. As we get the tariffs resolved, there\u2019s probably a nickel of uplift involved in that. When you think about China and some of the stimulus they\u2019ve done, they reduced the VAT tax and so a lot of the Chinese buyers just waited till that kicked in. So, we\u2019ve seen some reduced activity around that. And then frankly, there are very few buyers. As long as we\u2019re in a falling crude price environment, they were waiting for it to bottom and apparently, it\u2019s bottomed and we\u2019re heading back out. So, I would say that as we sit here today, we\u2019re constructive about margins over the next couple of quarters. And then you add on \u2013 layer on top of that potential start-ups in the fourth quarter of this year or first quarter of next year, which could put a little kind of headwind in our base in terms of moving pricing. But we\u2019re \u2013 I think we\u2019re constructive over the next couple of months in margins.","Matthew Blair ","Great. Thank you.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Justin Jenkins from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Justin Jenkins","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I want to start with a follow-up to Phil\u2019s question from earlier on the NGL side. We got a couple of new fracs come in late next year and maybe another one after that. I just want to see how you think about the expansion potential at Freeport or even another export terminal beyond that?","Greg Garland","Well, on the frac side, we\u2019ve got two, three well into construction. We\u2019re in discussions about Frac 4 with customers. And as I indicated in my opening comments. I\u2019d say there\u2019s quite a bit of interest around that. We actually have air permits in hand to build a Frac 4, and if we can nail down the customers on the supply of the frac, which I think we\u2019ll probably get to this year, we\u2019ll probably FID a fourth frac there. On LPG export, I think that\u2019s probably more challenging one for us. We\u2019ve underperformed our own expectations on the LPG export. We\u2019ve seen the dock fees come up as utilizations across the industry have come up and we\u2019ve kind of been expecting that and we\u2019re probably up \u2013 I don\u2019t know 15%, 20% on the fee, spot fees are up at around $0.10 today across the dock. So, we\u2019ve kind of on a spot basis broking into double-digits. I think at $0.10, you can justify new investment. One of the issues we\u2019ve got is, we need to build out frac capacity to fill up that export facility. Today, we\u2019re running about 120 a day across the Frac 1 and we\u2019re yielding maybe 40 a day of propane. So, if we run in 200 a day across the dock, we\u2019re bringing the balance out of Mont Belvieu, that\u2019s not efficient. So, we\u2019d want to match additional LPG export facility with frac capacity in the future. So, we have no plans today other than we\u2019re looking at what would take to debottleneck this facility. So, there\u2019s nothing firm in our plan today around the expansion of LPG export.","Justin Jenkins","Got it. Thanks. I got it what I was looking for. Appreciate it.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Jason Gabelman from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jason Gabelman","Yes, hey, I just had a couple of questions. First on CPChem, I wanted to get a better understanding of maybe what the mid-cycle value was of the asset. It looks like that operations were pretty strong for the quarter despite the weaker margins. And I\u2019m just wondering using this sensitivity you guys have provided, what type of mid-cycle ethylene chain margin we could apply to kind of get an idea of what this thing could generate in cash mid-cycle?","Jeff Dietert","Yes, so, if you look historically at CPChem since the spin, average EBITDA has been about $1.6 billion over that period of time. When you look at the \u2013 most of that was prior to the new U.S. Gulf Coast project coming on line, which is roughly around $600 million mid-cycle environment. So, I think that would be incremental, that would be during a period where the polyethylene full chain margins were a little bit higher than where they are today. So, I think you can use the sensitivities to adjust to where you think mid-cycle is somewhere mid-20s mid-to-high 20s on a ethane to polyethylene full chain margin.","Greg Garland","Jeff\u2019s EBITDA numbers were our shares of CPChem\u2019s EBITDA though.","Jeff Dietert","Right.","Greg Garland","And I\u2019ve always thought give or take $0.25 is a pretty good number for ethane to polyethylene full chain margin.","Jason Gabelman","Got it. Thanks. And if I could just shift to the refining side of things, it seems like the industry is going to have elevated maintenance in the second quarter and based on your guidance it seems like you guys aren\u2019t really participating in that. So, I was just wondering if you could comment on that both your operations and what you\u2019re seeing industry wide and I\u2019ll leave it there?","Jeff Dietert","Yes. I think as Greg and Kevin said early on our assets are back up and running, maintenance is relatively light for us this quarter, turnaround expense of $70 million to $90 million for the second quarter, which is relatively light for us. I would agree there\u2019s still a lot of maintenance ongoing especially in the Mid-Continent industry wide and the California market as well as the U.S. Gulf Coast. So, there are a number of outages that are planned through at least mid-March in those areas.","Operator","Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brad Heffern","Hey, everyone. I wanted to go back to Roger\u2019s question from a while back. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion about bottlenecks emerging once these long-haul Permian pipes come on line like Gray Oak and sort of the time lag between when the pipes come on line and when the ultimate export solutions come on line. So, I just wanted to get your updated viewpoint on how you see that progressing and do you see a widening Gulf Coast spread environment versus Brent as these pipes come on line?","Jeff Dietert","Yes, I think there\u2019s a lot in the mix there. First the pipelines are being built often by an operator that\u2019s different than the operators of the export facilities. And so we are seeing in our own portfolio with Gray Oak scheduled to come on by the end of the year and our South Texas Gateway really not fully up until midyear 2020. Now, Gray Oak pipeline does have access to other export facilities at Corpus Christi and so there\u2019ll be other alternatives there as well as to our Sweeny Refinery. As the pace of production growth will determine how full those pipes are, which I think is another part of the equation is how rapidly do these pipes ramp up, and then finally the last leg is export facilities, which appear to be pretty optimally designed. But there\u2019s, I think opportunity that there could be mismatches between pipeline availability and export availability.","Greg Garland","Longer term.","Jeff Dietert","Yes, longer term, I think we\u2019ll have sufficient export facility over time.","Brad Heffern","Okay. Thanks for that, Jeff. And then I guess I wanted to talk a little bit about renewables, you guys had that in the press release for the first time, I think. So, I was just wondering if you could talk about maybe the scale of capital that you\u2019re devoting to renewable diesel and then also talk about sort of your comfort level with investing in something that largely depends on sort of regulatory support?","Jeff Dietert","Yes, it\u2019s a great point, Brad. Yes, so at the Humber Refinery, we\u2019ve got a project under way that will add 6,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel through co-processing of used cooking oil. At Ferndale, we\u2019ve got a project under development with Renewable Energy Group that\u2019s got the potential for 18,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel. And then finally, we\u2019ve got an agreement with Rice [ph] to provide the feedstock and offtake for up to about 11,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel from plants that are starting up in Nevada later this year and early next year. So, those are the things that are on the immediate front-burner. As you look at our California refining capacity, it\u2019s roughly 350,000 barrels a day, that\u2019s total West Coast. At 40% diesel, that\u2019s kind of a 130,000, 140,000 barrels a day. So, we\u2019re offsetting some of that risk with renewable diesel into the West Coast.","Greg Garland","But the CapEx exposure for us is a couple of $100 million at this point in time. And you asked a great question about how much CapEx sort of one put at risk, and two, a business that requires essentially a government mandate. And so I think you\u2019ll see us be kind of careful about that. Given the way things are structured now, the returns on these projects are very, very attractive. And so we think putting a couple of $100 million to work in this area is certainly appropriate given our portfolio and particularly given our exposure of 300,000 plus barrels a day capacity on the West Coast of the U.S.","Brad Heffern","Thanks. Appreciate the answers.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Craig Shere","Hello. Thanks for letting me in.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Craig Shere","Two quick questions. One piggybacking on Bill and Justin\u2019s LPG export question, I understand you\u2019re not looking at expanding your own export capacity at this point, but can you talk about prospects for de-risking margins with renewed multi-year contracting. And the second question is, can you update us on your outlook for Latin America product export prospects with all your efforts there?","Jeff Dietert","Yes. So, on exports to Latin America, we\u2019re continuing to see Latin American refining utilization at very low levels and we\u2019re expecting those to continue. So, Latin America is proving to be a good export market both on the diesel side and the gasoline side. Some of the Mexico imports have been recovered, but not all compared to some of the pipeline outages that we saw earlier in the year, but some of that market has come back \u2013 a lot of that market has come back, but not all. On the LPG export question, we have a combination of long-term and short-term agreements and our commercial people are constantly in the market trying to optimize the delivery, the volumes that we have in place. You recall, we started with 150,000 barrel a day, expectations that LPG export facility is operated much better than that operating at 180,000 to 200,000 barrels a day of capacity recently. And so, we\u2019ll be in the market looking for solid contracts.","Greg Garland","Yes, I would say, a window is probably starting to open. When you kind of had spots around $0.06, we obviously didn\u2019t want a contract during that period of time, but as you start to push into double-digits, I think that, that optimum window will open for us. We\u2019ve had great success in moving the volumes out of the export facility and now we got work on the margin side.","Operator","Thank you. We have now reached the time limit available for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeff Dietert","Yes. Thank you, Julie, and thank all of you for your interest in Phillips 66. Please contact Brent or me if you have any questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

My name is Christine and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell [ph], Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Unidentified Company Speaker","Thank you, Christine. Good morning and welcome to Phillips 66 third quarter conference call. With me this morning are Chairman and CEO, Greg Garland; President Tim Taylor; EVP and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Maxwell; and EVP, Clayton Reasor.","The presentation material we will be using this morning can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 web site, along with supplemental, financial and operating information.","Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It's a reminder that we'll be making forward-looking comments during the presentation and our question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here on the second page, as well as in our filings with the SEC.","So that said, I will turn the call over to Greg Garland for some opening comments. Greg?","Greg Garland","Thanks Kevin. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Third quarter was a good quarter for us. In refining and marketing, we operated well. We are able to capitalize on a strong market environment. We executed our scheduled turnarounds and we did so safely, and as you know, that's very important to us. Our chemicals business, despite downtime at the CPChem Port Arthur facility, earnings were strong, also reflecting favorable market conditions.","We are delivering our commitment to grow our Midstream business. On the picture in front of you, that's a picture of the Sweeny Frac 1, its progressing nicely, as is the LPG Export Facility at Freeport. We look forward to giving you frequent updates on these important projects.","We are also evaluating the opportunity for second frac, have a capacity of 110,000 barrels a day. We expect to reach a final investment decision mid-2015. It will be up and operational mid-2017.","We are continuing to build on our midstream momentum. We have plans for 200,000 barrel a day crude and condensate line, that will connect the Eagle Ford to our Sweeny refinery and our Freeport terminal. Five Points will have the capacity to expand to over 400,000 barrels a day. We are also considering condensate processing options.","Yesterday we announced the formation of two joint ventures with Energy Transfer to develop the Dakota Access pipeline, and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline, or DAPL and ETCOP. We will have a 25% in these JVs, and our proportional share of the construction costs is approximately $1.2 billion.","Collectively, DAPL and ETCOP will have the capacity to move around 450,000 barrels a day of crude from North Dakota to market centers in the Midwest and the Gulf Coast. ETCOP will collect directly to our Beaumont terminal that we recently acquired. We did close on the Beaumont terminal this quarter. We bought this asset for what I can be. It has a great footprint, has a great location, great employees, and in our view, tremendous value creation opportunity. So we are very excited about this asset.","Currently, it has over 7 million barrels of storage capability. We see the opportunity to expand this to 12 million barrels. So I think you will see us move soon to start expansion of this facility. Beaumont gives us deepwater access and the capability to export crude and products of 600,000 barrels a day, that more than doubles our current capacity. We think this terminal integrates nicely with our midstream growth plants, and also provide our Louisiana refineries increased access to advantaged crudes.","Last September, we said that by 2018, we expect to have access capable generating about $2.3 billion of EBITDA that could be dropped into our Master Limited Partnership. This estimate did not include EBITDA, which we expect from the newly announced DAPL or ETCOP projects. [Indiscernible], as we continue to execute our midstream strategy of growth, EBITDA destined for our Master Limited Partnership, PSXP will continue to expand as well.","We will utilize Phillips 66 Partners as a source of funds to grow midstream. Last weeks announced 340 million drop further demonstrates our commitment to PSXP and our desire to grow it. The rail-unloading facilities at our Bayway and Ferndale refineries and the Cross Channel Connector Pipeline are great assets, they tie into and they support our operations. Also with Cross Channel Connector, PSXP will grow organically, and we anticipate PSXP's ability to continue to execute additional midstream growth projects will increase.","Integrated with our Midstream growth plans is our focus on enhancing refining returns by accessing advantaged crudes. We see crude by rail continuing, delivering domestic crudes to the East and West Coast. By early 2015, we will have 3,700 railcars dedicated to crude oil movement.","We are constructing a rail-loading facility, with up to 200,000 barrels a day of capacity in North Dakota. In August, our company began operations at a 75,000 barrel a day rail-rack at the Bayway refinery, and a 30,000 barrel a day of rail-rack at our Ferndale refinery is in the commissioning phase. This quarter, we improved our advantaged crude capture to 95%.","So we are working on a great portfolio of midstream projects. Our Board recently approved a $1.2 billion additional capital for DAPL and ETCOP pipelines, and we expect that this spend will occur over the next two years. This is in addition to our prior guidance around 2015, and we do not plan on slowing down our investments in NGL and LPG projects. We will provide you with an update of our 2015 capital program in December, once we have reviewed it with our Board.","As a management team, we remain focused on capital allocation. You should expect double digit increases in dividends for the next couple of years. Our view is that our dividends are secure. They need to be growing and they need to be competitive. We have increased the dividend 28% this year. Of the $7 billion of share repurchases that have been authorized by our board, we have repurchased $4.4 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 6 million shares, and at quarter end, we had 554 million shares outstanding. We will continue to buy our shares, as long as they trade below the intrinsic value. We believe doing so creates value for the shareholders of Phillips 66.","And finally I'd say, we feel comfortable that we have the capacity to fund an aggressive capital program, and still maintain a strong focus to shareholder distributions. We are committed to sharing our success with the owners of our company.","We have multiple sources of funds, including cash from operations, our balance sheet, cash on hands, our Master Limited Partnership. We are at the low end of our debt-to-cap ratio, and that provided with other sources, provides us with optionality, and also the capacity to continue to grow, and grow our distributions.","So with that, I will turn it over to Greg, to go through the quarter's results.","Greg Maxwell","Thanks Greg. Good morning. Starting on slide 4, third quarter adjusted earnings were $1.1 billion or $2.02 per share. We had two special items this quarter, that impacted our Chemicals and our Marketing and Specialties segments.","In Chemicals, there were impairments at CPChem, mainly related to the Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics business and in Marketing, we recognized a portion of the deferred gain from the sale of a power plant last year. Adjusting for these special items, the effective tax rate was 33% for the third quarter. Cash from operations excluding working capital for the quarter was $1.3 billion. We funded $1.5 billion in investments, and we paid $771 million in shareholder distributions. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 22%, and after taking into consideration our ending cash balance of $3.1 billion, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 12% at the end of the third quarter. And finally, our annualized adjusted year-to-date return-on-capital employed was 14%.","Slide 5 compares third quarter adjusted earnings with the second quarter on a segment basis. Overall, third quarter adjusted earnings were up $277 million, mainly driven by higher results in refining, as well as in our Marketing and Specialties segment. I will cover each of these segments in more detail, as we move forward.","Starting with Midstream; during the quarter, we saw increased volumes across all of our business lines, and in transportation, we closed on the Beaumont terminal acquisition. The annualized year-to-date return on capital employed for Midstream was 14%, and this is based on an average capital employed of $4.1 billion.","Slide 7 shows Midstream's third quarter earnings of $115 million, up slightly from the $108 million last quarter. Transportation and DCP Midstream earnings were in line with the prior quarter. In Transportation, higher volumes and throughput fees were more than offset by increased operating costs, mainly due to higher maintenance activity. And at DCP, the increased volume activity from the various projects that have come online, was mostly offset by a decline in commodity prices.","In our NGL business, we had gains on seasonal propane and butane storage, as well as higher overall volumes on the Sand Hills and the Southern Hills pipeline.","In Chemicals, CPChem's global olefins and polyolefins capacity utilization rate for the quarter was 83%. This reflects downtime at the Port Arthur facility, resulting from the fire that impacted their ethylene furnaces early in the third quarter. SA&S had higher equity earnings this quarter, coming off turnaround activity in the prior quarter. The annualized adjusted year-to-date return on capital employed for our Chemicals segment was 29% on an average capital employed of $4.4 billion.","As shown on slide 9, third quarter adjusted earnings for Chemicals were $299 million, down from last quarter's record earnings of $324 million. In olefins and polyolefins, the decrease of $51 million is largely due to the CPChem's Port Arthur ethylene cracker being down. Although Port Arthur represents approximately 11% of CPChem's total O&P production capacity, the impacts from it being offline were lessened, as CPChem was able to pull down inventory. In Specialty, Aromatics and Styrenics, the $25 million increase in earnings was primarily due to less turnaround activity during the third quarter. ","Moving on, Refining had a good quarter. WE operate our refineries well, and we safely worked through several turnarounds. To annualize year-to-date return on capital employed for refining was 12% on average capital employed at $13.5 billion.","Moving on to the next slide, the refining segments had earnings of $558 million, this is up over 40% from last quarter. Although market crack spreads were down in all regions, except for the Atlantic Basin Europe region, we were able to benefit from higher realizations on clean products. We also benefited from our configuration, as we produced more distillate than what is implied in the 3-2-1 market crack, and distillate cracks improved this quarter. In addition, secondary product markets increased, primarily due to the decline in crude prices.","The Atlantic Basin Europe and Central Corridor regions had the benefit of an improved feedstock advantage compared to last quarter, whereas the Gulf Coast and the Western Pacific regions were impaired on feedstock advantage, as well as by the build of inventory during the quarter.","Refining and Other was improved this quarter due to successfully capturing additional location arbitrage and product blending opportunities. This improvement also reflects gains associated with the timing of crude purchases.","Let's move to the next slide on market cap share; our worldwide realized margin was $10.89 per barrel, compared to $9.66 per barrel last quarter, with our market cap share improving from 61% to 73%. Relative to the market crack of $14.85 per barrel, configuration, which represents our clean product yield and also our secondary products, were a negative impact on our realized margins. Partly offsetting this was the capture of the crude advantage opportunities and feedstock, as well as product differentials, which represents the largest driver in the other bar. Compared to the second quarter, the largest movements were in the secondary products and the other categories, as secondary product margins and product differentials improved.","Moving next to slide 13; this slide shows the comparison of advantaged crude runs at our U.S. refineries by quarter on the left and by year on the right. During the quarter, 95% of our U.S. crude slate was advantaged, and this compares with 93% last quarter. This represents a record quarter for us. The improvement was tied to increased crude runs at our Alliance Refinery, after their second quarter turnaround, and was also due to certain crudes becoming advantaged, relative to Brent.","Moving on to Marketing and Specialties, or M&S; M&S had a great quarter, driven mainly by higher margins and marketing, and in specialties, we closed on the Spectrum acquisition in our lubricants business. The annualized adjusted year-to-date return on capital employed for M&S was 27% on an average capital employed at $2.8 billion. Capital employed in M&S increased this quarter, mainly due to the Spectrum acquisition which was completed in July.","Slide 15 provides some additional detail on our M&S segment. Earnings from M&S in the third quarter were $259 million, representing a $97 million increase. The improvement in Marketing's earnings primarily reflects higher global marketing margins, due to the steady decrease in product costs during the quarter. We exported 129,000 barrels per day this quarter, down from last quarter's exports of 181,000 barrels per day. This was primarily driven by domestic markets being more favorable for product placement.","Specialties' earnings were in line with the second quarter, as increases in earnings from the Spectrum acquisition offset reduction in our XL [indiscernible] JV business, due to turnaround activity.","Moving on to Corporate and Other; this segment includes net interest expense, it includes corporate overhead costs, and it also includes technology and other costs and accruals that are not allocated to our operating segments. Corporate and Other after-tax costs were $91 million for the third quarter, and this compares with $121 million last quarter. The decrease was largely due to the effective tax rate, as well as timing of contributions and lower environmental costs.","And this brings us to the third quarter cash flow; starting on the left, excluding working capital, cash from operations was $1.3 billion. Working capital changes were a negative impact of $828 million, largely due to builds and inventories. We expect this inventory build to reverse in the fourth quarter. We spent $700 million in capital for the Beaumont terminal and the Spectrum acquisitions. We also funded $800 million of capital expenditures and investments, mainly associated with NGL projects, and we made shareholder distributions of nearly $800 million this quarter, in the form of dividends and share repurchases; and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.1 billion, this is down $1.9 billion from the beginning of the quarter.","This concludes my discussion on the financial and operational results, next I will cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, CPChem continues to ramp-up its 250,000 metric ton per year 1-hexene facility at Cedar Bayou, which began operations in the second quarter. The global O&P utilization rate in the fourth quarter is expected to be in the low 80s, as we anticipate CPChem's Port Arthur facility to begin the process of restarting its olefins units in November, with some portions of the plant remaining down until year end. For the fourth quarter in refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and pre-tax turnaround expense to be about $130 million.","In Corporate and Other, we expect the segment's after-tax cost to run around $110 million for the fourth quarter, and the overall effective income tax rate for the coming quarter is expected to be in the mid-30s.","With that, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And our first question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Thank you. Good morning guys.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","First question, and maybe to a few questions around the same topic. I am trying to zero-in on the potential gains embedded in your organic Midstream program kind of built to drop. So firstly, on the dropdown last week, $340 million, what was the cost to build the rail terminals?","Greg Garland","I don't think we put out a number in terms of the rail terminals. I would say that probably typical Midstream type multiples is kind of the returns that we would expect out of those.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","So kind of seven times -- billing it seven, and then you sold it around 10, I thought?","Greg Garland","Yes sir.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","And so, if I extend that thought into your $2.3 billion of your EBITDA, that's probably [indiscernible], as you mentioned, growing maybe 2.5 after yesterday's JV, built to drop [ph]. I mean is there -- I mean, can you quantify -- should we expect similar relationship to that EBITDA, or maybe more explicitly, how much of that infrastructure exists today versus what is -- what you are spending on to add? Does that make sense?","Greg Garland","I think its kind of 500 is what exists today in terms of the EBITDA, and the balance is growth, Evan. And I would say, those are fairly typical tight Midstream projects and returns. There are some that are better than others in that. The other thing you think about too is, we get the MLP to scale, it can co-invest and they can do some of these projects on it also. So I don't know that I would necessarily think that all $2.3 billion of that ultimately would be built at PSX and initially drop into the MLPs. There will be some combination to that going forward in the future. But our challenge today is really get the MLP to scale, have a balance sheet, so that they can access the debt and equity markets.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","No. I just think its less appreciated if you did that 1.7 times of a three-turn difference, $5.4 billion recurring gain on that portfolio, assuming it was all at the Phillips level. Let me switch gears on the second question to Chemicals, and just trying to get some color on the margin compression on the ethylene side. I mean, the Brent prices determine polyethylene price, and maybe you could help determine the impact of the oil move on your ethylene chain margins, and longer term if oil prices remain lower, do you think that risks investment for additional Gulf Coast ethylene capacity expansions in the U.S.?","Tim Taylor","Evan, this is Tim. So roughly, I would say for every $10 in TI on just a cost basis versus ethylene today, you could kind of think about price in a pound compression on the margin and the cost side. Market factors impact that as well. But long term, that's kind of the structural difference. So its quite large today. We have anticipated that that would come in with ethane rising a bit more than crude. I think structurally, we still feel that the gas to crude ratio kind of stays in the ballpark. So I think it has some compression, but I think we plan for some of that, and we still fundamentally believe that crude will be relatively expensive to a gas-based feedstock.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Is there anything on the macro that you look for, whether it'd be some stabilization on the ethylene, cents per pound advantage before you would proceed to FID a second cracker? I mean, how do you think about the rest of the macro and making additional investment there?","Tim Taylor","Yeah, I mean, I think crude's going to fall substantially to takeaway that advantage. So you would look across that value chain, but today where it is, they are still -- I think, incented to do that. Probably, I think more about it just in terms of favorability of the feedstock, but we have always had a strategy at CPChem around ethane-based cracking and that's been a very good place to be, so we looked in the Middle East, looked in North America; and I think fundamentally, we would say that crude would have to go quite a bit lower before we'd see that advantage dissipating. But that is a factor that we will think about in terms of additional investments, wherever they are.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Great. Appreciate it guys. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Dietert of Simmons. Please go ahead.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company","Good morning.","Greg Garland","Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company","Following along on the Chemical sector, you provided some update on the Port Arthur partial restart in November, full restart by the end of the year, if I heard it correctly. I was wondering, if you could talk about the opportunity lost and the facility being down in the third quarter, what would chemical earnings had looked like, if it had been operating in the margin environment that was available?","Greg Garland","Jeff, I think when we look at it, I like to think about it that we probably got about a five month outage when we think about Port Arthur. So that's roughly in the range of say 750 million, 800 million pounds of lost production, and then you can put the margin on that. I think the third quarter was mitigated somewhat by coming out of inventory, so that will continue to be an impact over the next two quarters. But in macro, we just think about it in terms of the lost pounds, and that's kind of how I'd think about that opportunity, that you can put the margin assumption on there that you'd like, but that's the best way to kind of put that estimate.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company","Got you. And as far as 2014 capital budget, no changes to the $3.9 billion presented last quarter. I think the new projects are more 15 plus type investments, is that fair?","Greg Garland","That's fair. Our guidance is still around $3.9 billion for 2014.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company","All right. Thanks for your comments.","Greg Garland","You bet. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Gresh - JP Morgan","Hey good morning.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Phil Gresh - JP Morgan","First question, you talked about the working capital build in the quarter. I was wondering if you could talk about the impact that that had on the profit line, particularly for refining in the Gulf Coast, I think you called that out. Any quantification you could give there?","Greg Maxwell","Phil, its Greg Maxwell. I think as we look at it, we've got the large system and we trade around that, and so we end up having both crude and product impacting our inventory builds, that was the case in the third quarter. As far as regionally, we would expect that to reverse itself largely in the fourth quarter from an inventory working capital perspective. But other than that, we don't have any real guidance down to the particular regions.","Phil Gresh - JP Morgan","Okay. But you would say it was a particularly large drag on the Gulf Coast profits in the quarter?","Greg Maxwell","That's correct. We saw a negative -- or a positive in the second quarter and then a bit of a negative in the third quarter. So it is sort of a double dip, when you compare quarter-versus-quarter.","Phil Gresh - JP Morgan","Got it. Okay. With respect to the balance sheet and the usage of cash, obviously you have a lot of growth investments you are focused on, and you have also talked about doing significant buybacks, which I would assume means continuing along the current run rate of what you did in that third quarter. So I guess what I am just wondering is, if you put all those things together and you look ahead, say two years from now, where do you want your leverage to be, on the balance sheet?","Greg Garland","Well I think we have consistently said we are going to target a 20% to 30% debt-to-cap and we certainly wanted to float in there, if necessary. I think we have purposely structure the company to be successful; continue its growth investments, continue strong shareholder distributions in a volatile commodity environment. So we don't see any change to our strategy.","Phil Gresh - JP Morgan","Okay. Last question, just with respect to all the midstream projects; obviously, you increased the target again in September and now you have layered in this other JV. Is there any -- realistically, is there any financial or operational path in terms of how you're thinking about the opportunities ahead, given what's already in the pipeline right now?","Greg Garland","No. I think that -- I would say we are on track. Our strategy is a transformational change into a Midstream logistics company, with great refinances and great chemical assets, and I think we are on path. We have laid out more than $2.3 billion worth of EBITDA growth between now and 2018 in our Midstream segment. I think we are -- I would say we are pleased with the project portfolio we have. We are executing well, in terms of delivering on those commitments.","Phil Gresh - JP Morgan","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Good morning.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Two things. I guess, first off, the Bakken pipeline announcements; could you give us an idea of what sort of commitment on shipping those have? I mean is it 100%, is it 80%, just kind of what backs up the volumes there?","Tim Taylor","We are in the middle of an extended open season on that, and so -- we really don't disclose the commercial details, but I think the capacity we have talked about is at 450,000 barrels a day.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay. So we will go with that for right now?","Tim Taylor","Yeah. I think that you've got to let that process work itself out. And we would -- obviously, with the extended open season, I think the prospects are that that may increase.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay. Second question, kind of switching gears here to the refining side. Comments on the call, and if I am looking the numbers correctly. Exports were 129,000 barrels I think, and then down from 181, if I wrote that correctly in Q2, and the comment was along the lines of better domestic demand. Could you give us an idea today, as you look at the market and you're thinking about sort of domestic pricing versus international product pricing that would drive the desire to export more? And the changes we have certainly seen in between various crude differentials along the Gulf Coast and elsewhere, kind of where we stand on that export volume today?","Greg Garland","Why don't I take a start, and then Tim can fill in the details. First of all, the export markets were there, they were available to us. We just made a decision to play some -- in a higher valued market domestically. I think the barrels we did export were somewhere between $1 and $2 a barrel better, than the alternative placement that we had available to us in the investment market. But in general, you are going to see us flex up and flex down to follow the market opportunity. You want to add on that?","Tim Taylor","I think structurally, pretty good demand, if we look at gasoline demand and distillate demand in the U.S., so that was the opportunity. But longer term, we still know that exports have got to happen, as we continue to run and incented to run. And so I think that we will continue to flex, as Greg said, but you should continue to expect exports to be a significant part of the U.S. refined business.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay. One follow-up on that if I could, any change into where your exported barrels have been going? I mean, Europe, Latin America, West Africa, any changes and sort of jump in capacity volumes?","Tim Taylor","On a U.S. perspective, no, and so I think those are still markets that are there, and those are logical markets to access from the U.S.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay. Thank you.","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of ISI. Please go ahead.","Doug Terreson - ISI Group","Good morning everybody.","Greg Garland","Hey Doug.","Doug Terreson - ISI Group","Greg, since the spin-off a few years ago, your team has been pretty focused on delivering growth, but in a capital discipline way; and because your returns continue to be pretty strong and lead [ph] the peer group in many of the businesses, you obviously demonstrated proficiency on value creation, but also on this transformational growth that you talked about a few minutes ago. So my question is whether or not we can get a progress report on the core components of the return enhancement plan and refining specifically, and then also, any of that strategic dollars [ph] that you might have on the West Coast and European parts of the refining portfolio?","Tim Taylor","Sure. I think that I would say we are on track with the return enhancement plan that we laid out, since like two years ago and updated this year. As you know, the biggest component of that is really accessing advantaged crudes and we are driving to 95% advantaged crude capture. But that's not the whole story, once you get advantaged crude, you look at the next best advantaged crude, you displace that barrel too. So I think around the infrastructure that we are investing and it does have the ability to help us liberate higher returns around our integrated refined assets. So we will continue down that path, and we will get to 100% advantaged crude next year or so, as we continue to move these projects forward around infrastructure.","You think about the portfolio, I think we said this year we will close on Bantry Bay and so we are on track to do that. Whitegate, really a failed process. No interest in someone buying the Whitegate refinery, so that asset is essentially off the market for now. We have an ongoing process in Melaka, and I think our expectation has certainly ended this year, first quarter next year, we will complete that process.","Doug Terreson - ISI Group","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Tim Taylor","Thanks Doug.","Doug Terreson - ISI Group","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Good morning. A simple one to start with. The condensate pipeline, and the [indiscernible] in that $2.3 billion midstream forecast?","Greg Garland","Yes.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then, $340 million drop, that's great. I guess, you've got an EV of $45 million and $2.3 billion of MLP investments is going to grow. I mean, I was just joking with my team, that I'd need to live to 100 to see the entire asset base transfer down to PSXP. SO I guess, just the questions really are, what are the constraints on you guys going faster, and I do obviously hope to live to 100?","Greg Garland","Well the first thing I was going to say, we hope you do live to 100, but you got to give us credit for the 740 we have done; so we have done $1.1 billion this year, as you think about the drop and the MLP and I would say, we have consistently said, our view is that -- we will probably keep our foot on the accelerator, [indiscernible] in terms of the Master Limited Partnership. It\u2019s the valuable part of our growth program, in terms of funding this Midstream growth. And so I think that clearly, we have stated intentions that clearly, the long term will be -- top quartile in terms of distribution growth will certainly parse [ph] 2015. But over the years, we are going to be quite a bit above that.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Right. I mean, you have seen obviously what's going on in the space, where people have used consolidation to perhaps create a larger MLP? Obviously, there is GP accretion from that, and then potentially that might be a base to then drop further assets in perhaps a faster pace. I mean, is that something the woodwork in your vision?","Greg Garland","We have got a great backlog of projects Ed, as they come on. I think it has increased that backlog of droppable EBITDA. So we are going to -- to Greg's point, you're going to grow your MLP and commensurate with that Midstream growth; and its always a possibility that we could look at some type of opportunity to expand that. So I think that's just part of our strategic view that we see a lot of value creation in that segment and the MLP is just a really key piece to make that happen.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","And then two smaller questions; I appreciate your open season, but any idea on what sort of tariff it would take to take Bakken barrels down to Beaumont?","Greg Garland","That has not been -- the FERC tariffs have not been filed. So once that's complete, that will be available. But we believe, I will say this -- that this will be the most economic pipe solution from the Bakken to the Gulf Coast.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yeah. Reconverted gas pipe I think probably is, definitely. And then on the throwaway comment that you made on refining in the Gulf, you said there were some feedstock restrictions, can you walk us through what those might have been in the second quarter -- sorry third quarter?","Greg Garland","Yeah so second versus third, we had -- Alliance came back on after turnaround, so you had more exposure to light and medium grades with that. And then there was less availability of [indiscernible] the crude, and that was backfilled with more light medium. So we had a mix effect, that gave more exposure to light medium versus heavy in the third quarter.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Hi guys. To the extent -- you have been asked a lot of questions around this, but obviously -- arguably we have move to a new price environment here. Firstly, I was a bit surprised that your earnings weren't boosted more, you tried to break that out, but in the core products area, would we expect the lag to come through in Q4 from price downturn? And could you try and sort of [ph] how much of that would be sustainable, if its all possible if we stayed at this kind of price level?","Secondly, from the current price level, would you expect there to be an inventory or accounting of inventory impact? And then I am going to follow-up, which is a kind of a bigger question. Thanks.","Greg Garland","Paul, on the secondary products, I mean clearly as the cost of feedstock has come down, the margin on those products has gone up, and so that's kind of the direct correlation versus some price movement maybe on those -- maybe on the LPG in the cokes and those kind of things. But its really around that feedstock value, brings up the value of that secondary product. And so I think that, that really depends on the absolute level of crude. Maybe in a broader statement, with crude prices coming down, you've got probably on the direct margin, the chemicals business has -- probably could have I should say, the most exposure, as that margin comes in versus naphtha cracking. But generally with the margin business, there are just a lot of moving parts to what that really inputs during feedstocks and products.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","I guess what I am driving is that you had a negative in secondary products you show on slide 12, and part of the question is -- I know that you're trying to improve that capture in general, but obviously the volatility of the market makes it difficult. But I would have thought that that number might be better, because we sort of down move, although the majority obviously came later? That's a general idea I am pushing at?","Greg Garland","I think its probably $5 a barrel better quarter-over-quarter and I think assuming that crude stays where its at, that probably carries forward into the fourth quarter. But we always seem to have better capture in the fourth quarter anyway historically. So we will just have to see where it goes.","Greg Maxwell","And Paul, on your crude inventory question, I think you are as spot on as prices go down, you do see some flowed impact between net accounts receivable and accounts payable. We haven't publicly quantified that for anyone, but you will see some impact.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Okay. I will follow-up on that. And then the bigger question I had was that you have obviously invested a lot and succeeded in getting a much more, what you call advantaged crude slate. I was wondering how sticky that would be, if we saw a situation, where for example, global crude prices were at or below U.S. prices? I assume that your infrastructure investment would lave you still wanting to use the domestic option? Can you give us -- I mean, I don't know if I am barking on the wrong tree there, but the idea is you kind of incentivize by your infrastructure to use the domestic crudes almost to a much tighter price maybe than other people might think? Let us say if we --","Greg Garland","Paul, I think on the infrastructure, clearly the location of the refining asset has a snipping impact on the crude slate. So clearly the Midcon, some of the billings, pretty focused on the inland crudes. I think it really hinges on the optionality around say the Gulf Coast. Our infrastructure though, we think about it like this, that we have access to that, and we will go to the best value on the refining slate, and then we have got opportunities with our logistics to move those crudes into whatever market makes sense. So there is kind of a double-edged drive on the logistics as increased third party capability, as well as supplying our own system, and I think that's the balance that we are looking for.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Yeah I guess I am just trying to get a sense; for example, if we inverted Brent prices when under -- let's say LLS, to the extent that you would -- how far that would have to go before you would want to move back to using imported crudes, when you've done so much work to do the opposite?","Greg Garland","Well I think we keep that option on the table, and our comment -- my comment would be that, I would expect that mainland U.S. prices would probably adjust to be competitive. But we work around that short term optimization in our system today, and so we will flex as that differential moves, and we got the best value in our refining system.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Yeah, I guess I am just thinking out loud. The final question, do you have any observations on distillate markets right now? I know you have a relatively long distillate, anything that you could add? Thanks a lot.","Greg Garland","The distillate market still looks strong. So I think, kind of moving into the season, we are going to like that exposure on distillate side.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Thank you guys.","Greg Garland","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Guys, good morning. I was hoping to go back to the product exports. I know you said you exported 129,000 barrels a day, you are progressively building out your capacity. I am trying to get an update of where you stand right now in capacity, and also if you don't mind, some commentary around some of the new global capacity coming online that's export oriented, I am just curious if you have any thoughts on how the U.S. is going to be competitive with some of those new facilities in targeting, let's just say, the European market?","Greg Garland","I think we are close to 1 million barrels a day, with Beaumont plus the 420,000 that we have in the PSX refining system. Our view is we will continue to expand that. I think that the U.S. refiners, given the energy price advantage and some crude advantage are going to be well positioned to compete in export markets globally. But certainly in most, that are most geographically close to us, like Latin America, South America, West Africa, to a certain degree, Europe. But there is no question, you have got some big refineries coming up in the Middle East, that are targeting Europe and Asia, and they are very-very competitive assets, that I think [indiscernible].","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Okay. Just a quick one on Bayway; with the rail rack coming online, if I am not mistaken, historically, you have done a bit of barging Gulf Coast crude over to the East Coast. Does the rail rack basically displace that, or will you continue to do both?","Greg Garland","You know, we continue to do both. We have actually run the Jones Act ship up around the Bayway also, and so I think you will see us continue to do both.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Okay. And then the final one for me, I know you addressed Jeff's CapEx question on 2014, any thoughts around? I mean, there is a lot of moving pieces, so as we kind of progress into 2015 for the time being, do you think its fair to think flattish type of CapEx into next year?","Greg Garland","Well we had given guidance earlier this year on 2015, and so we will go to our Board in December and ask for approval for our 2015 budget. But certainly, I think that you should view that DAPL and ETCOP investments is incremental to what we have already said.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Right. Okay. All right, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Hey guys. Good morning.","Greg Garland","Hey. Good morning.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","A number of quick questions. Greg, earlier though, maybe your team talking about some destock limitation on Maya. Do you know if this is specifically for Phillips 66 is actually hitting for the whole industry? And can you quantify for us in some way that, [indiscernible] for you and have you seen that situation reverse?","Tim Taylor","Paul, our view is that its availability of production on the Latin American crude side; I can't speak to others, but certainly we have seen that, and in the interim, we are readjusting the supply chain. Clearly Canadian crude, heavy crude to the Gulf Coast can be a piece of that, that's starting to move with more rail infrastructure up there. So I think new supply options are developing as that changes, but that's our view is that, it has really been a reduced availability, that certainly we have seen.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Tim, can you quantify -- helping us to quantify, how can [indiscernible] negative hit on you in the third quarter?","Tim Taylor","I have not done specific around that, so I could get back to you on that with the sensitivity.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Okay. That would be great.","Greg Garland","We typically won't go to our refinery level that far.","Tim Taylor","Yeah. We might go to a regional level for you.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Okay, that's good enough. On the energy transfer, the total investment for the two JV is $4.8 billion to $5 billion. Is there -- is that incremental or that this is including some of the money already being spent?","Greg Garland","So that's the total value, and we will have a share of that total capital commitment. And its still, so you are in open season, you haven't done a lot of -- there have been some engineering work, and those kinds of things, so you are very early in the formation of the project on that.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Tim, from what I understand that, those two projects actually already have some existing pipe in the ground, is there upfront payment you guys have to pay in this year, related to that project?","Greg Garland","So its really around the contribution of the assets and everything, so that is -- the spending really occurs in 2015 and 2016, as kind of the split between those two years as we go forward Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Right. But how about -- how to fund the investment? How to fund your share -- that contribution?","Greg Garland","Fairly small spending this year. Really, the bulk of that spending on that total occurs in that 2015 and 2016 time period.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","And -- sorry.","Greg Garland","No, go ahead.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","On GP, can you tell us what is your GP cash flow, annualized run rate right now?","Greg Maxwell","Paul, this is Greg. If you look at the percent of the distributable cash flow that's received by the GP for this quarter's announced distribution, that would be 8%.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Great. It seems that -- if you can help me, since I don't have the PSXP [indiscernible] in the 10-Q. Do you have -- what is maintenance of dollar, that number?","Greg Maxwell","I don't have that right in front of me. I will get that for you.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","And also maybe a request, if possible in the future, I think it would be very helpful for your shareholder, given we are talking about logistic is going to be a big piece of the value creation for the company. If you can [indiscernible], what is your actual GP cash flow, so that we don't have to focus every different document, in order to find it?","Greg Garland","That's a great suggestion Paul, and we are going to do that. We talked about that this morning in fact.","Greg Maxwell","We plan on putting that in the supplemental information Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","I think that would be helpful. And also along those lines, because we don't know every quarter, whether its going to have a change in your LP unit ownership. So if you can also list how many LP unit and what is the total LP unit? Those are all available, I am sure in the PSXP, but just help your [indiscernible] shareholder don't have to go through a set of different documents.","Final question along those line, based on the balance sheet of the LP, what is the current maximum ability for them to do M&A, whether its through the internal job done or external M&A. How big is the balance sheet that they can do? Is that $1 billion, $1.2 billion a year, I mean any rough guidance that you can provide?","Greg Maxwell","With regard to total acquisition at the PSXP level?","Paul Cheng - Barclays","That's correct. I mean, how much that they can -- I mean, this year that you're doing $1.1 billion of the asset job done. Is that the maximum in terms of the financial balance sheet capability, or that you think that capability is actually bigger than that?","Greg Garland","Paul, I guess I look at, there is equity debt component and we targeted three times EBITDA on debt, and I think you look at the MLP access on the equity side, you start to see that $1 billion. So somewhere between $1 billion and $1.2 billion is kind of roughly in the range of what we think about could be managed from a purchased standpoint.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","So without issuing equity into LP, therefore it will be about $1 billion, $1.2 billion from a debt standpoint?","Greg Garland","No I think you've got -- as you go forward, with that you have got to have the equity offering or the debt to purchase the asset. So I think equity offerings are a natural way to grow that capability. It doesn't get into acquisition or a share exchange regarding that, that's a different issue. But just in terms of accessing the market and where the cash comes from, it really has to be held back from a distribution or asset come from access to debt and equity.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Right. Perfect. Thank you.","Greg Maxwell","Paul, I looked up, you were wanting distributable cash flow for the third quarter?","Paul Cheng - Barclays","That's correct.","Greg Maxwell","$33.4 million.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","$33.4 million. That is the total distributable and 8% is through the GP or that is the GP?","Greg Maxwell","No. That's total distributable, and so the 8% would apply to that.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","I see. Perfect. Thank you.","Greg Garland","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning everybody.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess, one of the things that has come to you periodically has been how we are -- I guess, how is the Street trying sort of value [ph] on your Chemicals business and the Structure business right now. And I hope you have been trying to look out, is the free cash flow outlook. So I am wondering if you could help us, how you see the self-funding chemicals growth evolving to a free cash position, and where you are in the decision process for the second tracker, which obviously would defer that free cash movement and [indiscernible]. That's my first one, and I have a follow-up please.","Greg Garland","So basically, as we have looked out, we are in the middle of a major project right now. Our view has been that the project will be funded with the Chemicals business, there will be distributions for tax payments. And next year is kind of the peak spending year, so I think a little bit there. And I think going forward, its really a question about, do they have the right return projects and the market fundamentals, and to the extent that they can self-fund and grow, we'd really like to encourage that. So I think our expectation is that, that they will continue to grow. But to a degree to which they do that, really depends on the view of the returns on the project and how much. But we do expect that to be a self-funding venture, with the payments back to the owners, at minimum tax distribution and discretion beyond that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So it seems like today.","Greg Maxwell","Doug, I think our current view would be that 2015 to begin and certainly self-funding and putting distributions back to Chevron and ourselves.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you update us on where you are in the second project, in terms of FID?","Greg Garland","Well I think we are -- CPChem is certainly looking at all the options and looking specifically in the U.S. at a couple of things. And so it really is still very early, looking more, at I would say conceptual market feasibility of returns that we expect and so just taking a hard look at that, but not really engaged in a lot of enduring work at this point. So its really decision point that they have got to bring forward to the owners for some approval and discussion. So its out there in ways, in terms when we would take any kind of investment decision, or if we would go forward.","I think just generically though, as we consider the opportunity universe in the Chemicals business, we still think that the U.S. Gulf Coast is probably the best place to invest. And I think that, and at least from our perspective, we wouldn't hesitate to go forward with the second cracker. I think the real challenge is where you're going to put it and what are you going to feed it, and that's kind of what we are working through right now.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And my follow-up if I may, all the way back to the MLP again. I guess, one of the things a lot of people talked about, drop downs and drop it down faster and all this kind of stuff, but there is no real discussion around time, value and money, tax basis, more importantly the impact on the refining business. So I guess, what I am really trying to understand is, what do you think is a reasonable pace that the MLP could actually handle by the way of annual sort of ratable acquisitions or growth if you like? And I guess in the same kind of vein, do you ever think that -- I guess its 10% of the $2.5 billion post this deal is refining -- within the refinery gate. Is there a scenario where you envisage moving the refinery EBITDA into the MLP, given the implications or the volatility of the refining business? And I will leave it there. Thanks.","Greg Garland","So we think the market capacity, given the size of this MLP, is probably somewhere between $1 billion to $2 billion of what we could do annually. And so, we could just leave at that. We really haven't given forward forecast of what our drops are going to be, other than around just quantify top quartile type of growth and distributions.","I still look at the refining business, the volatility of the refining business, and I would say, we probably would not put that into an MLP at this point in time. Just given the different yields and access to capital and cost of capital and using that Midstream business then to kind of tie up and integrate with our refining assets and improve our refining assets long term.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's really helpful; but I guess the answer I was looking for, because a lot of your -- some of your competitors are, I guess a slightly different view of that. Thanks very much for the answers guys, I appreciate it.","Greg Garland","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Brad Olsen of Tudor Pickering. Please go ahead.","Brad Olsen - Tudor Pickering","Hey. Good morning guys.","Greg Garland","Hey Brad.","Brad Olsen - Tudor Pickering","I wanted to walk for a minute if I could, through the Midstream EBITDA number. I know the $2.3 billion EBITDA that's now in the presentation, its certainly a robust number and assuming $2 billion a year of drops at a 10 times multiple, it gives you a close to a decade of runway. Does that include the recent Bakken pipeline deal you have announced, and if it doesn't, I am just trying to think about the $700 million that was announced back in 2012, plus the $500 million or so from the Sweeny complex? And then kind of trying to get from there, the additional $1 billion, if I am not using the Bakken pipelines? And I understand, there is a lot of small stuff in there. But just kind of one or two big chunky projects that, especially in the -- I believe the NGL segment, which will increase much greater than just the Sweeny frac complex alone?","Greg Garland","As you think about, first answer, the Bakken pipe is not in those numbers. And so clearly, that would be incremental to that, and you should expect typical tight Midstream returns outside of the Bakken pipe. What are in the numbers, essentially the frac-1 frac-2, the LPG export, and we have said $700 million or $900 million of EBITDA in there.","One of the things that the organization has done really well in the last year, is to queue up a really strong portfolio of growth opportunities for us to invest in. Around our footprint if you will, and we are executing well, in terms of getting these projects started, getting them up, getting them running. And so I feel really comfortable with our portfolio, our capability to fund it, and we like the opportunities that we see.","Greg Maxwell","Beaumont is in there as well.","Greg Garland","Yeah. Beaumont is in there as well. Good thinking.","Brad Olsen - Tudor Pickering","That's really helpful. And just a jump back to the Bakken in that, or the Bakken pipelines, the crude pipeline investment if I could. It looks like a really attractive deal obviously, you kind of pointed out that they are your typical kind of seven times midstream returns, while also being kind of a long term regulated cash flow stream. So when I think about that, you have obviously made it a point to say that strategically, Midstream is kind of driving the bus on a go forward basis, and refining is probably less of a focus in terms of growing the business. And so, kind of piggybacking on Paul's question; when you think about kind of -- which part of the equation is the dog and which part of the equation is the tail, to use a clumsy analogy? On the Bakken deal, is this a deal that you would have done, in absence of your Gulf Coast refinery footprint, or is it something that you view as adding significant value, even if you hadn't participated in equity in the pipeline, would it have been something you had looked at from a refining point of view? To what extent would this pipeline project maybe have played out differently if you were or were not looking for crude for those Gulf Coast refineries?","Greg Garland","So I think -- when I look at it, its not predicated on supply into our system necessarily. It\u2019s a great option, and that's a value that we bring to our refining system. We like the fact it\u2019s a long haul crude pipe from the basin, that ties directly to our Beaumont terminal and so we got options across that Gulf Coast system, you got Midwest delivery. So we like that, it can tie into our supply, and it\u2019s a factor as we think about that, but its not -- the key driver was not supply, but it was really around the Midstream opportunity. So we think it\u2019s a great asset, its going to continue to enhance our position in the Bakken or our position in the Gulf Coast. Great linkage.","Brad Olsen - Tudor Pickering","Thanks for that color. And when I think, if supply -- supply is maybe not the main driver, but I assume that you guys are a significant shipper on the pipeline, and does it enhance your position? I guess you mentioned earlier in the call that this is the lowest cost option out of the Bakken, and as we see other pipeline facing delays out of the Bakken, that option probably gets more valuable over time. But as I think about how much volume you guys are going to be directly involved in kind of marketing of this pipe, is there a good number or are you an anchor shipper, or is this more of just an equity investment without a volumetric commitment?","Greg Garland","So we are in the middle of an open season, and we will take a commitment, but that's all we are going to say on that.","Brad Olsen - Tudor Pickering","Okay, great. And just one more kind of housekeeping question. Greg, you talked about the hexane facility kind of still in ramp-up mode. As we think about where that facility or when that facility reaches full economic contribution, does the incident at Port Arthur prevent the hexane facility for any reason, from being able to sell full volumes or is the run rate unaffected by that, and if you wouldn't mind providing a little bit more specificity on the timing and maybe just a rough kind of EBITDA number on that facility as it does hit a 100% or close to 100% utilization?","Greg Garland","I don't think that Port Arthur is going to impact the run rate on hexane-1. As it ramps up into 2015, Port Arthur is going to be back up and running. So I don't think Port Arthur is going to enter into an equation in terms of run rate. In terms of fully ramping the facility, I don't know, it will probably ramp over in 2015 and 2016, would by guess.","Tim Taylor","Yeah. I mean I think in response to demand. So we have been very happy with the startup, been very happy with the customer reception on the product side. So it has gone very well, but you do have just the normal ramp up in terms of demand and how that works.","Brad Olsen - Tudor Pickering","Got it. That's all for me. Thanks a lot guys.","Greg Garland","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we have reached the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin Mitchell.","Unidentified Company Speaker","Thank you very much for participating on the call this morning. We do appreciate your interest in the company.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Kevin, you may begin.","Kevin Mitchell","Thank you, Le Ann. Good afternoon and welcome to the Phillips 66 second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Chairman and CEO, Greg Garland; President, Tim Taylor; EVP and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Maxwell; and EVP, Clayton Reasor.","The presentation material we\u2019ll be using during the call can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website along with supplemental, financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It\u2019s a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from today\u2019s comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here on the second page as well as in our filings with the SEC.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg Garland for some opening remarks.","Greg Garland","Thanks, Kevin. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us today. We had a strong quarter. Adjusted earnings were $1 billion or $1.83 per share. Our refining, chemicals, marketing, specialties businesses all made significant contributions to our operating results for the quarter. Our global refining business includes the utilization of 90% and also benefited from strong market cracks. We safely completed a major turnaround in pipeline replacement at our Humber Refinery in UK on time and under budget. Our U.S. refineries ran at 95% utilization. Marketing sales volumes were up reflecting increased gasoline demand.","We\u2019re executing well on our midstream growth projects. Sweeny Fractionator One is 90% complete. We expect mechanical completion this fall. The Freeport LPG export terminal is nearly 50% complete with expected startup in the second half of 2016. Both projects are on schedule and on budget. Our master limited partnership Phillips 66 Partners increased its quarterly distribution by 8% over the first quarter. We expect that Phillips 66 Partners will deliver a five year 30% compound annual distribution growth rate through 2018.","Total general partner distributions to Phillips 66 continue to grow; we\u2019re up 50% versus last quarter. DCP is an important part of our NGL value chain and it is one of the nation\u2019s largest natural gas gatherers and processors. DCP is doing a good job. They\u2019re operating well. They\u2019re managing cost, the Lucerne 2 plant in DJ Basin came online in the second quarter.","In chemicals CPChem benefited from rising cash chain margins and ran well during the quarter. CPChem also began operations of its 220 million pound per year normal alpha olefins expansion project at its Cedar Bayou facility in June. Construction continues on CPChem\u2019s U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project which is now about 50% complete start ups mid 2017. The project remains on time and on budget. During the quarter we generated strong cash flow. We used 1.2 billion of cash flows to support midstream growth and to maintain operating integrity of our refining system. In addition compared to the first half of 2014 controllable cost are flat.","We maintained our capital disciplined approach in terms to capital allocation. During the second quarter we returned over 600 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We increased our dividend 12% this quarter. We have completed 5.6 billion of the 7 billion in share repurchases authorized by our Board and since our formation we\u2019ve increased our dividend 180%. With that I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Greg Maxwell who will go through the quarter results. Greg?","Greg Maxwell","Thanks, Greg. Good morning. Starting on Slide 4, second quarter adjusted earnings were $1 billion or $1.83 per share. There are two significant special items that are included in reported net income but excluded from adjusted earnings. First DCP recognized a partial goodwill impairment that negatively impacted our reported earnings by $126 million after-tax. The impact to this impairment was more than offset by the recognition of $132 million after-tax deferred gain that was related to the 2013 sale of the Immingham combined heat and power plant. Excluding negative working capital changes of $300 million cash from operations was $1.8 billion which included distribution from CPChem of approximately $800 million.","We invested approximately $900 million on midstream growth projects and $300 million in refining. Through the second quarter dividends and share repurchases have totaled more than $1.3 billion which presents more than 70% of adjusted net income for the first half of the year. At the end of the second quarter our adjusted debt to capital ratio excluding Phillips 66 Partners was 26% and after taking into account our ending cash balance our adjusted net debt to capital ratio was 11%. The annualized adjusted return on capital employed during the second quarter was 13%, and excluding special items our adjusted effective income tax rate was 33%.","Slide 5 compares second quarter adjusted earnings with the first quarter on a segment basis. Overall quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were up $168 million driven by increased earnings in refining and chemicals. Next we\u2019ll cover each of the segments in more detail. Starting with the midstream on Slide 6, our transportation business continues to be a source of stable earnings, included in the transportation and NGL results is the contribution from Phillips 66 Partners. During the quarter PSXP contributed earnings of $25 million to the midstream segment. DCP Midstream is addressing the challenges associated with the lower energy price environment and they continue to deliver on cost reduction targets while providing reliable service to their customers. We\u2019re continuing to work with our co-venture to evaluate alternatives to address DCP's capital structure. Annualized 2015 year-to-date adjusted return on capital employed for this segment was 5% and this is based on an average capital employed of 5.7 billion. The return for this segment continues to reflect the impact of lower commodity prices as well as increased capital employed due to the significant investments we\u2019re making in Midstream.","Moving on to Slide 7. Midstream's second quarter adjusted earnings were $48 million down $19 million from the first quarter. Transportation earnings for the quarter were 65 million. This is unchanged from the prior quarter. Transportation benefited from increased volumes offset by the benefit of a claim settlement in the first quarter. Our NGL business had lower earnings due impart to lower seasonal propane volumes. DCP Midstream had adjusted losses in the second quarter that were higher than the prior quarter and this is mainly due to asset sales which account for $11 million of the negative variance.","Moving on to Slide 8. In chemicals the Global Olefins & Polyolefins capacity utilization rate for the quarter was 91%, reflecting lower turnaround activity compared with the prior quarter. Both the O&P and SA&S business lines benefited from higher margins. The 2015 annualized year-to-date adjusted return on capital employed for our chemicals segment was 21% based on an average capital employed of 4.8 billion.","As shown on Slide 9, second quarter adjusted earnings for chemicals were $295 million up from $203 million. In olefins and polyolefins the increase of $84 million was largely due to higher cash chain margins. O&P equity affiliate earnings improved as a result of higher sales prices as well as increased volumes due to the completion of turnaround activity in the first quarter. The segment also benefited from $28 million in insurance proceeds related to CPChem's 2014 Port Arthur ethylene plant outage. Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics earnings improved on higher styrene margins from CPChem's equity affiliates.","Moving next to refining. Realized margins for the quarter were $11.70 per barrel largely driven by strong market conditions. Market captured decrease from 80% to 62% in the quarter due to our configuration which yields less gasoline and distillate than it is premised in the typical 321 crack spread in addition we saw tighter crude differentials along with higher losses on secondary products. Refining crude utilization increased from 90% from 84% in the first quarter and clean product yields were 84% consistent with prior quarter. Annualized 2016 year-to-date adjusted return on capital employed for refining was 16% and this is based on an average capital employed of 13.5 billion.","Moving to the next slide. The refining segment had adjusted earnings of $604 million up $109 million from last quarter. Overall the improvement this quarter was primarily due to improved gasoline crack spreads partially offset by lower distillate margins and higher secondary product losses. Adjusted earnings were higher than the first quarter in every region. Atlantic Basin adjusted earnings reflected downtime from the planned Humber turnaround but benefited from higher margins and the lack of foreign exchange losses that occurred during the first quarter.","The Gulf Coast was up from last quarter reflecting improved capacity utilization and reduced maintenance cost at Alliance partially offset by lower realized margins. For the Central Corridor we showed moderate improvement due largely the higher volumes compared to the first quarter, we can\u2019t plan turnarounds at the Ponca City and Borger refineries\u2019. This was partially offset by lower margins driven by narrower differentials on Canadian crudes. And for the western region the improvement was driven mainly by increased margins despite crude supply impacts on our San Francisco refinery as a result of the plant\u2019s pipeline outage, the western region utilization rates improved to 94%. We continue to pursue permitting of the Santa Maria rail rack project to increase our crude supply optionality.","Next we\u2019ll cover market capture on Slide 12. Our worldwide realized margin was $11.70 per barrel versus the 321 market crack of $18.94 resulting in an overall market capture of 62%. Our configuration allows us to produce roughly equal amounts of diesel and gasoline, which reduced our realized margin relative to market as the improved market crack was driven by the strength in gasoline. Benefits from feedstock advantages were not high enough to fully offset secondary product losses which were substantial given the rise in crude price relative to coke and other secondary product prices. The other category mainly includes cost associated with rents, ongoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. A regional view of our market capture is available in the appendix.","Moving on to marketing and specialties. This segment posted another strong quarter thanks to higher domestic marketing volumes and continued strong margins in our lubricants business. Annualized 2015 year-to-date adjusted return on capital employed for M&S was 25% on average capital employed of $3 billion. Slide 14 shows adjusted earnings for M&S in the second quarter of $182 million down $12 million from the first quarter. In marketing and other the $10 million decrease was largely due to foreign exchange losses as the dollar weakened against the pound and the euro and this decrease was partially offset by higher domestic marketing volumes.","Moving on to corporate and other. This segment had after tax net costs of $127 million this quarter which included fixed asset write-offs and an environmental liability accrual together totaling $15 million. Net interest expense and corporate overhead decreased compared to the first quarter.","Next I\u2019ll talk about our capital structure. Consistent with last quarter we\u2019re showing our capital structure both with and without Phillips 66 Partners. Excluding Partners we ended the quarter with an adjusted debt balance of $7.9 billion, an adjusted debt to capital ratio of 26% and a net to capital ratio of 11%.","The next slide shows our cash flow during the quarter. Starting on the left excluding working capital cash from operations was $1.8 billion. Working capital changes resulted in a negative impact of $300 million primarily due to the timing of federal income tax payments. We funded $1.2 billion of capital expenditures in investments and distributed over $600 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and the repurchase of over 4 million shares resulting in 538 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. And we ended the quarter with the cash balance of $5.1 billion.","This concludes my discussion of the financial and operational results. Next I\u2019ll cover a few outlook items. For the third quarter in chemicals we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In refining we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to also be in the mid-90s and pre-tax turnaround expense to be about $120 million. In corporate and other we expect this segment\u2019s after-tax cost to be lower after recognizing some infrequently occurring items in the first two quarters. We expect corporate cost to run between $110 million and $120 million for each of the next two quarters. And company-wide we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s. As for 2015 capital expenditures our original $4.6 million guidance remains unchanged. With that we\u2019ll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate","I wonder if I could start I guess I don\u2019t want to be too predictable here but just maybe get your latest thoughts on DCP situation and it looks like that the trailer debt multiple is certainly elevated and at this time is used basic during the [indiscernible] solution that yourself and your partner can live with? And I have got a follow-up please.","Greg Garland","So I will start I always like to start with it is a good business. We like the business, we like the assets, we think basins there we are in are good long-term value creating basins in the Permian, Eagle Ford, DJ, Mid-Con, so we like the asset footprint, clearly we need to do some restructuring at DCP we need to deliver I think that we\u2019re engaged in conservations with our partner at how best to do that. I think what you heard Greg say in the notes but sometime this fall we expect to get to a resolution on that. DCP is doing all the things they need to do in our view in terms of running the business safely reliably they have taken out a lot of cost, reduced CapEx et cetera, and so from an operational standpoint they are solid on that. And what we\u2019re trying to do at the end of day is structured DCP for the long-term, so that it can remain the largest natural gas gatherer and the NGL gatherer in the U.S. and have a good platform which it can continue its future growth. And so I think with that we\u2019ll get to the right resolution for DCP I'm confident of that, it is just going to take some time.","Doug Leggate","And I appreciate your answer I know it is not an easy thing to deal with. I guess my follow-up is really more current industry in MLP world, you have seen a number of your competitors there is some fairly aggressive things in terms of boosting their GP growth through acquisitions. You've obviously recognized your venture on the pipeline, but I'm just curious as to structurally are you thinking differently about how to bring forward that GP value, or are you still happy to move forward with your growth projects that you have got in place right now?","Greg Garland","Well as you know we've got a nice backlog I would say but we've got a great opportunity and organically to grow the MLP, we certainly have a lot of existing EBITDA left at PSX also and in terms of that, and so our view. But as we think about the MLP I think we've come to the conclusion that we want PSXP to be a fee based entity going forward with high growth rates. We think we create the most value by doing that, let's say we would never entertain an idea of an acquisition there, but it would certainly have to be something down to fairway that is fee based complimentary to the assets portfolio we have today, so crude pipelines, terminals et cetera. And that we would maintain that fee-based structure going forward. And then I think you also have to acknowledge that everyone gets treated fairly whether it's the GP or the LP unitholders. And so think that you have to think that all the way through in terms of the partnership.","Doug Leggate","A quick follow-up if I may. On the GP value sale, I know it's still relatively early days but is the intention at some point to make moves, to make out the value more transparent, in other words take out public markers because obviously you've got some of the margins there is something as C-Corp consolidated discount and I'm just curious on your thoughts on that? And I will leave it there. Thanks.","Greg Garland","I would say we\u2019ll certainly make it transparent, we\u2019re going to tell you exactly what it is and you could read in the report. I think the question, I keep asking is do you have to put a public marker out there to realize the value back into C-Corp and there is probably examples on both sides of that and there is probably no guarantees either way. I don't think we\u2019re in a hurry to answer that question. I think we\u2019ll be patient. I think we've said we have never considered IPOing the GP, I don't think we would ever say that. I think there may be a point in lifecycle in the MLP that leads you to do that, but it's certainly not in the near future for us Doug.","Operator","Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse is on line with a question.","Ed Westlake","Yes I mean I guess I am following on DCP. I guess a lot of people feel that obviously the business needs new capital but we\u2019re also hearing term the impacts or the concerns on maybe under investment is impairing DCP's actual operations and customer reputation. So I wondered if you wanted to address that, it is great ground field position but how the business is performing.","Greg Garland","Well and so I mean we\u2019re still investing in growth in DCP. We\u2019re very interested in DCP's reputation. We want DCP to be viewed as a long-term reliable partner with some very large people out there. If you think about the portfolio the DCP has today. And so I would say we\u2019re very consist with that Ed. I think they are operating well. Their volumes are solid. Where we\u2019re seeing some volume degradation is mostly around ethane rejection that\u2019s coming out of the let's say the Mid-Con Rocky area. But the volumes are certainly holding up in core regions in the Permian and Eagle Ford et cetera. But long-term we've got to position DCP such that it has the capacity to grow and it has the capacity to be there for the folks that are out in the field, and that\u2019s exactly what we intend on doing.","Ed Westlake","And then switching to refining, I mean you were clear that this year was going to have a little bit more maintenance maybe a little bit of an update on the outlook for the second half of this year and whether this period of maintenance extends into 2016 and maybe a little bit of color on any benefits that you\u2019ve driven into the plant as you\u2019ve taken the opportunity to take some of these plants down?","Greg Garland","So I think our guidance remains consistent in terms of turnarounds obviously \u201915 is a heavy turnaround year for us we knew that going in into \u201915 and we communicated that. So \u201916 probably won\u2019t be as heavy here is what we\u2019ve seen in \u201915 it will be more of a normal year of turnarounds for us. We are trying to get on five year cycles between the major assets and we\u2019re doing a pretty good job of getting there in our view. I\u2019ll let me Tim if you want to make some comments.","Tim Taylor","Sure. On the benefit of turnarounds clearly get clean so you can run at a high utilization post turnaround and second of all we\u2019ve indentified that we wanted the full point improvement in refining we are on that path and about half of that a little bit more comes from cost yield reliability. So turnarounds are really the change for us to do things like the flash column at Alliance for light crude, it\u2019s ways to upgrade, controls, improve reliability and so we take that opportunity to really improve I guess you might call it robust and so the operation. So we anticipate going forward that it provides us additional consistency and reliability as we get through that.","Ed Westlake","So we should mainly see it in OpEx and maybe a little bit in capture?","Tim Taylor","Yes, I think on operating utilization in OpEx you bet.","Ed Westlake","Okay. Thanks so much.","Tim Taylor","I should mention yield as well. We take chance to go in new distribution on vessels in terms of getting more efficient and that\u2019s one of the ways that you can tweak declining product yield in our system.","Greg Garland","Yes it\u2019s really -- and sometimes it gets hard to quantify that the capacity decrease probably is 1% to 2%. If you want to think about on that basis and maybe to 1% yield improvement and so I mean the real dollars and they are certainly ones that we know how to capture it.","Operator","Jeff Dietert from Simmons is online with the question.","Jeff Dietert","It looks like a very strong performance in the chemical segment this quarter I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the fundamentals in the business. The oil prices are still low yet, your margin strengthened again and if you could talk about demand both domestically and in the export market?","Greg Garland","Yes, Jeff. Really what we\u2019re seeing on chemical side is I think we\u2019re still in the up cycle in terms of a demand driven cycle. When you look at supply increasing relatively modestly and we\u2019re just seeing really good demand around the globe, the U.S. has been good, export opportunities throughout the U.S. are good and then Middle East operations are running very well. I think as an industry the U.S. and the Middle East run full. Europe is coming back a bit with some of that slack as well as Asia but I think it just speaks to the fundamentals we have seen that demand improve and we anticipate in the next couple of years that would help pull that utilization and that is an important factor just as much as the cost piece is. But we\u2019ve certainly seen the LPG cost in the U.S. comes down a bit more relative to crude as well which has helped. But I think this is largely kind of the demand side that we\u2019re seeing and so we feel that the demand piece in the world is actually been fairly good from a chemical standpoint.","Tim Taylor","Yes I think our view is, I\u2019m sure we will get to crude at some point in time, but our view is crude is going to be probably a little bit longer NGLs a little bit longer that\u2019s directionally positive for margins and chemicals and demand from chemicals albeit I think a reason is topical news, the question is demand in Asia. What our experience is every time you see crude prices fall you see some reduced buying activity in Asia folks are trying to time the bottom there. And so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re concerned about the fundamentals of demand in Asia at this point in time.","Jeff Dietert","Any information you can share on exports, chemical exports regionally Asia continuing to be a large percentage. How are those exports evolving as far as regional markets?","Tim Taylor","Well, I think the U.S. is and in the Middle East are the larger suppliers on the global market and Latin America out of the U.S. is approximate market, but the large demand pull continues to be Asia and that\u2019s really met through the U.S. and through Saudi Arabia. I think Europe has seen improvement in their economy that\u2019s largely self-supplied. So I think the global recovery that we\u2019re seeing in demand kind of spread evenly, but in the end it\u2019s that pull from Asia which is the largest pull and then you serve that really from the low cost centres in the Middle East and the U.S. So a lot of opportunity built around that, but generally I would tell you that we see good demand relatively in almost every geography it obviously depends on which geography in the growth rate but the developing piece of the world still has good demand.","Operator","Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley is on line with a question.","Evan Calio","Let me lead off with really a follow up to Doug\u2019s earlier strategic question. I mean Greg, what\u2019s your view on the Midstream asset or corporate markets where we\u2019ve seen two major transactions that could be the beginning of a bigger consolidation wave I mean overtime do you still see PSX as a potential and natural consolidator given the GP uplift at PSXP and the currency premium in the MLP or has DCP really been occupying your near-term bandwidth?","Greg Garland","I wouldn't say DCP is occupying our near-term bandwidth at all, I think it's obviously something we want to get done and get fixed and I think we\u2019re on path to get that done. I mean it's interesting to watch how all this has unfolded. You may have one shot at it and your currency is gone. So you want to think about it that way. So fundamentally we have a great organic backlog, we have 20 plus billion dollars of backlog of projects. And we don't feel the need to rush out and do something. We already have a midstream business, so we don't need to move there, we have a diversified perspective across PSX, so we\u2019re in chemicals, we\u2019re aren\u2019t buying we\u2019re gathering and processing and so we don't feel the need, we\u2019re shifting our portfolios on a higher multiple higher value businesses, we\u2019re on track we\u2019re on plan, if there was something out there that was complimentary. We would certainly take a look at it from PSXP standpoint but to somehow push the yield up by going and doing an acquisition that put commodity risk and exposure into SXP we just don\u2019t have any interest in doing that right now.","Evan Calio","And then may be as a natural segway to when you talk about growth organic growth you recently announced JV with Energy Transfer and Sunoco to build the pipeline and I don\u2019t want to Charles I think I am going to say Charles sorry. Maybe you can discuss the MLP will EBITDA benefit the dual benefits there from a midstream dropdown aspect as well as potential volumes that you could get tracked with Alliance and make that refinery more competitive with that Houston arb?","Greg Garland","Great, you've answered the question pretty well. I'll let Tim talk about its new pipeline.","Tim Taylor","Yes so it's a great extension of our Beaumont terminal, good partners with Sunoco and Energy Transfer, this is a 30 inch line coming out of Beaumont over to Lake Charles and we just announced a supplemental open season to determine that we want to increase the capacity east to that in the St. James as part of this announcement, but we\u2019re actually under construction now from Beaumont to Lake Charles. It starts to bring those Texas crudes into Louisiana a lot of interest a lot of demand and you are actually right there is a knock on effect in terms of value that we can have both at Lake Charles and Alliance. In terms of their project size it depends of the size of the pipe the number that we look at between $700 million and $900 million of investment we\u2019re 40% owner and we get a typical midstream build multiple say of seven on that to give you some idea of the impact that it has. So it's a significant add to the MLPable Midstream EBITDA so we\u2019re happy that and we think it has got good fundamentals so we really like that project.","Evan Calio","I mean well building at 7 and dropping at 10 and improving your refining margins pretty good business.","Operator","Paul Cheng from Barclays is online with a question.","Paul Cheng","Greg on the DCP sorry to ask that one more time, does the partner already have agreed on the timeline to find a solution, I mean that in October that they have $700 million of the debt need to be I think refinanced, so is that percent is a deadline that you need to have a solution or that doesn't really matter?","Greg Garland","It is part of equation we\u2019re trying to solve here to get to restructuring of DCP. I think our view is clearly it is going to be a deleveraging in that, and so the fundamental question is how do you make that happen. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re working through with our partner I mean with the folks at DCP. But I have a high degree of confidence we\u2019ll get that done.","Paul Cheng","But I guess my question is that, is there already a timeline that has being agreed between the two partners and that when that you guys will need to find a solution or that you are just going to continue to work on a solution but not really have a deadline in mind?","Greg Garland","We know Paul this is Greg. As far as liquidity perspective you are aware that DCP has a $1.8 million revolving credit facility I think what you are referencing is the $200 million bond that comes to it at LLC level in mid-October, still have some liquidity available under the existing revolving credit facilities. So from that perspective it's not a bright line of October that has to have something completed, however we\u2019re as Greg indicated working with our partners to get something done from restructuring perspective as soon as we can.","Paul Cheng","Greg since I got you here, do you have the preliminary 2016 CapEx number that you can share?","Greg Garland","[Multiple Speakers] 2016?","Paul Cheng","Yes. [Multiple Speakers] 2016 anything any estimate that you can share?","Greg Garland","Paul what we said is 3 billion to 4 billion in terms of that. We get our Board in October for approval the 2016 capital budget, so I don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of ourselves. But as we\u2019re thinking it through it is going to be in that range which will be down from 4, 6 this year.","Paul Cheng","Should we also assume that by 2017 that number will be further down?","Greg Garland","It\u2019s possible that it may come down some, as we\u2019ve -- part of we openly want to do see Midstream growth funded by PSXP but we\u2019ve got a lot of projects on our plate. We want to get done and we could easily see $2 billion of Midstream investment for the next couple of years I think. The other question is where else to get funded it is PSX to PSXP.","Paul Cheng","And final question from me, maybe this is for Tim. It seems like that the industry is having a pretty tight supply on the high octane branding component. The question is that within your system, is there any good low cost de-bottlenecking opportunity for your reformer and [indiscernible] unit?","Greg Garland","Yes Paul, you are right. We see, I\u2019d say octane still being a very strong demand and that we expect that to continue given light crudes to [indiscernible] that come out of that. So I think there is a continuing pull and so we\u2019ve got a variety of small projects that we\u2019re looking at around Appalachian units and reformers to find ways to drive a little higher production through there and then we\u2019ll watch that market and see if there is a need for a larger solution. But there is a lot of opportunity within our existing system to drive some additional octane improvement through a variety of ways our [indiscernible] units for instance et cetera. So a lot of things on the table given what we see and given the outlook that we think is going to be there for the need for octane.","Paul Cheng","And is there something we can quantify saying that are we talking about 20,000-50,000 barrel per day kind of opportunity in terms of expansion. Any kind of data that you can share?","Greg Garland","Kind of in the preliminary piece I haven\u2019t summed it all together Paul. We can get back as we look at that a little more detail but it\u2019s not huge in terms of the size of a new plant, but I\u2019ll get back to you on kind of the rough estimate what we think we can do, but it\u2019s not a massive new amount of capacity in that.","Operator","Blake Fernandez from Howard Wheel is on the line with a question.","Blake Fernandez","Greg you kind of invited the question on crude so I\u2019d be curious to get your thoughts there, but more specifically I think the last time I had a chance to visit with Tim your LP models were promoting kind of a shift from heavy to light and more specifically a focus on imported barrels rather than domestic barrels and I\u2019m curious if you can update us with the current landscape if that is still the situation right now.","Greg Garland","Yes I\u2019ll take a stab at it and then Tim can come clean up behind me here. So to start backwards there is no question whether this came in. We actually set cards on the siting. We brought imported crudes in into the system, that\u2019s a given where our expectations are for the third quarter I\u2019d say cards are coming off of the sitings and we\u2019re going to import less crude given what we see going on with bps. So you think globally, we think crude is oversupplied. And we continue to think that. OpEx is up 1.5 million barrels a day versus February it looks like to us. Production in the U.S. isn\u2019t following as fast as people kind of expected, do you want to think about that and clearly we\u2019ve got better North American crude logistics a day than we did a year or two years ago. The dollar is strong as you want to think about that. And so I think all that just say crude is going to be oversupplied for some period of time.","So as we think about the markets we kind of expect that cracks come in the fall probably the but the bps widen, so margins will still be relatively healthy is our view as we go into the fall season given turnarounds. And this looks problematic to us globally as we think about. There seems to be plenty of distillate around the world today. Gasoline demand continues to be pretty good but that will peak this summer and tail-off in the falls normally go so, just to sum it up it looks like there is plenty of crude out there and we\u2019ll continue to be for some period of time and then we flex our system, we flex max gasoline in the second quarter, and any more color you want to add on that Tim.","Tim Taylor","Well I think in summary we are seeing North America supply probably increasing right now. You\u2019re seeing the bps widen. And so I think fundamentally we anticipate less important for us in the life side going forward, better utilization of inland crude, the rail utilization is coming back up to taking to the East Coast more supply of Canadian crude and so I think that\u2019s the dynamic that we see. So I think to build on Greg\u2019s point that\u2019s what we think is going to help to drive the shift in the crude slate. So we\u2019re optimizing around that. But that would be the big change obviously given the really narrow bps that we saw but in response to that we increased imports and I think at this point we\u2019d anticipate that would go back down.","Blake Fernandez","Maybe I will just use that as my follow-up then. Tim earlier you were talking about the opportunity to increase capture and a lot of that associated with the yield. If I recall you guys had previously provided kind of an outlook on increasing your ability to process domestic crude in your system and I was just trying to see where we are in that process. Have you fully maximized that opportunity or where do you stand there?","Tim Taylor","I think there is still a little improvement and we did turnaround Alliance let us put in place a column to build -- run lighter crudes there. That\u2019s a work underway for instance at Wood River which is kind of an interesting we\u2019re going to increase -- we can increase heavy crude input but that\u2019s because we can take the lite fractions out. So I think we\u2019re looking around the systems still looking at ways particularly in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con and Bayway to drive more like crude into that system, of course Ferndale is a piece of that and made progress and then California really though for us is continuing to be a focus on heavy crude alternatives. So making progress we\u2019re running more and more type crudes I would say as we go along through if you look back quarter-on-quarter and so we\u2019re just finding lots of ways to debottleneck and optimize around that system and then during these turnarounds sometimes there will be opportunity to put harbour in place and let's just do that. And then the logistics solutions are a piece of that as well.","Operator","Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank is on the line with a question.","Ryan Todd","Maybe if I can follow-up a little bit on capture rates. If you can think little bit about capture rates in the second quarter they were a little bit lower I guess and particularly on the Gulf Coast was a little bit lower, I know there has been maintenance and distillate margins of that has hit it a little bit, but can you talk a little bit about maybe some of the drivers as lower capture rate in the Gulf Coast region, and maybe in that same context I think you mentioned -- have you maxed out your gasoline yield, is there anything more you can do to swing the system in that way and what\u2019s your view on gasoline distillate margins going forward?","Tim Taylor","So I'll start with the Gulf Coast when we look at that we've got a lot of exposure in Louisiana and to LLS, and so those differentials are really types of brand. So I think that there was a narrowing of light heavy but in particular we've got exposure there so that is a piece of that, we also had some maintenance at Sweeny on our Humber unit, and so that took away some of the advantage on that, so there was a mix effect but largely the crude values weren't as wide or didn't offer as much opportunity help drive that. There is the issue or the crack difference between gasoline and distillate we are more heavily distillate that drives that. We do tweak machines so to speak to run more gasoline as we optimize around that given the response to the market prices. So there is an opportunity to do that, but I think fundamentally the other part of that is the secondary product values that we saw crude prices flat price increase that $10 a barrel and we saw product prices increase about $1. So you lost on that 20% of the barrel roughly that goes to the secondary products you lost the margin there as well. So all those factors combined the Gulf Coast led to a relatively low market capture versus some of the prior periods.","Ryan Todd","And maybe on the gasoline and distillate side, are you flexed as much as you can be and what\u2019s your view over the next six months, 12 months, 18 months view. Do you view those are converging on the distillate and gasoline side, or gasoline remain stronger for longer versus distillate?","Tim Taylor","So I think gasoline continues to be strong with demand. We\u2019re seeing that, we\u2019re six months in and we look at our data industry data about 3% increase in the U.S. seems to be where we see 3% or 4% distillate less so, but you running max gasoline modes you are making the distillate you've got contango\u2019s you are pushing storage you are going to get into the planning season if you are going to get in the heating oil I think that brings up the distillate demand fees in the northern hemisphere or in the U.S. So we would expect them to come closer together, but I still think gasoline is going to show stronger demand versus distillate as we go forward, as long as the price of gasoline continues to stimulate the driving in the U.S. and China and India.","Greg Garland","We\u2019d probably flex gasoline demand -- or production 3% to 4%. And maybe there is a little bit more juice left in that but not a lot. Because I think we are in max gasoline mode.","Ryan Todd","And maybe on a different note, a number of your peers have talked about or tried to quantify the EBITDA\u2019s associated with the fuel distribution the MLP or EBITDA number. Any thoughts from your side on what you might have in your system and your interest in doing that?","Greg Garland","We've not included that first of all in our MLPable when we talk about MLPable EBITDA we flex that in marketing, it is significant it\u2019s not something that we felt that we needed to have to drive the growth, but when you look at the U.S. our marketing income has taken a piece of that of course as our wholesale piece so that gives you some rough magnitude of the dollars involved, but our organic portfolio generates a lot more of that EBITDA that you can get from there, and I think that we can always consider it but it's not something that we are going to replace right now given our midstream focus.","Operator","Faisal Khan is Citigroup is on the line with the question.","Faisal Khan","Just a few questions and I'll not ask a question on DCP. For the last opportunity with Humber being down obviously your capture rates and utilization were lower on the East Coast could you just talk about what was financials or lost opportunity given where the cracks were in the Atlantic Basin?","Greg Garland","So we are looking at each other to answer that. So I mean total turnaround in planned maintenance was about 7% for the quarter. And so Humber [Multiple Speakers] Humber was down for half of the quarter. It was a major turnaround in the pipeline replacement so it was down about 45 days to 90 days. And you can multiply that number by the crack that you work with Europe and it get close and then it was a major turnaround that was in excess of $100 million. So it was significant for us.","Faisal Khan","And just on the couple of other questions, one I guess first on the midstream side the Sweeny Fractionator One as that facility comes online towards the end of this year, where are you guys targeting sort of those products, where are you planning to move those products? And if you also talk a little bit about whether you guys are going to get involved in the -- I know you have the expert facility ramping up next year, but are you going to be moving LPG out of the country on your own account, meaning are you signing up of shipping capacity? Are you looking to sort of get involved in the global LPG trade in your marketing arm?","Tim Taylor","Okay. This is Tim Faisal so on the Frac the ethane will stay in the U.S. So the 100,000 barrel a day Frac, roughly 40,000 barrels a day of ethane that\u2019s under commitment to U.S. customers. That leaves you the propane the butane and the heavier fraction for the other 60% right now that would be a domestic consumption largely then when the export facility starts up a year later it feels the part of the commitment that we had for the shipments that we have committed on that terminal on the propane and to a lesser extent the butane side. So that Frac is the key piece but there is a lot of flexibility in that system between Sweeny, Mont Belvieu and the chem operations there that on the propane and ethane, butane side. The demand is essentially placed with contract.","On the terminal and the LPG trade we have commitments from third parties on those and they are diversified you have commitments in Latin America, you have commitments in Asia we\u2019re working on Europe. So yes, we\u2019ll be a piece of the global LPG business and I anticipate that we will take a piece of that but really we\u2019d like we really are focused on getting third party business there with that the people that have that demand in end use in their business. So, and we\u2019re looking a lot of options on supply around that, but fundamentally the most of that load it will come out of other demand centers or other companies that they have contracts across that terminal.","Greg Garland","And you\u2019d also say that, we\u2019d look at things on FOB and on a delivered basis.","Tim Taylor","And there is opportunities to work that, so lot of commercial options developing around the LPG.","Faisal Khan","Okay. And are you also looking at commercial options that LPG into your own facilities that CPChem means the assets you have in Asia and Europe, would you consider sort of delivering LPG into those facilities or you have been bridging that with potential expansions or capital projects at those facilities?","Tim Taylor","Well certainly CPChem in the U.S. is a customer and with the growth in their business you can logically be a piece of that. I think the LPG for us the customer base is broader than CPChem and given their position to where they want LPG it\u2019s really the Middle East and it\u2019s in North America. So, not a lot of opportunity for CPChem in Asia or into Europe, at this point, so is really the focus has been on markets, either heating markets or pet chem markets with customers in those other regions and not reliant on the CPChem operations.","Faisal Khan","I think we saw the distributions come through in the quarter from CPChem with the sort of debt offering there. Can you talk a little bit about how much more capacity you have at CPChem to raise debt, are we going to see more distributions from CPChem based on sort of do we right size the balance sheet of that entity especially given where oil prices are maybe there is another incentive bring a partner to take that more cash at this point in time.","Greg Garland","Faisal this is Greg. Certainly we\u2019re always looking at that, but as you know that was sort of onetime event for us to take the $1.4 billion of that at CPChem and distributed fifty-fifty to their partners, we never say never we\u2019ll continue to look at it, but at this stage of the game, I would say we don\u2019t have plans to further lever CPChem\u2019s balance sheet.","Operator","Phil Gresham from JPMorgan is on line with a question.","Phil Gresham","First question on the chemical side, how much propane are you running today versus say three to six months ago, and do you see a significant uplift potential as we move forward from running more propane?","Greg Garland","So in the U.S. CPChem is running about 10% more propane than it would have at the end of last year and the real optimization around the crackers is that as you feed more propane in you can actually diminish your ethylene production. So it\u2019s an optimization about that the total value of either ethylene or propylene and so there hasn\u2019t been just a huge shift in the products slate, the input slate to one propane versus ethane. So the margins have been quite strong in the ethylene chain and that\u2019s really pushed toward ethane still but you have begun to put some more propane in and I think that that\u2019s a general comment that you would see around the industry. And so I think that\u2019s something we would anticipate you can bleed more and so to speak, but we still see a heavy ethane guide at this point.","Phil Gresham","And then on Midstream, with the start up of frac-1 at LGP export next year you've given the long-term targets of what the EBITDA contribution from those two specifically should be I guess at this stage would you say you are on track with that contribution and how much specially should we think you would be able to get in 2016 will you would be running full on frac-1for example. Just any color you could give there?","Greg Garland","So frac-1 would our anticipation we\u2019ll be running full based on our supply commitments that we have in place for the raw NGL and so that\u2019s 100,000 barrels a day with usual mixture of ethane, propane, and butane the LPG terminal it comes up in the last part or later part of 2016 so that really starts to hit utilization in \u201917. And so we haven't broken out the EBITDA between the two we've just given the total.","Phil Gresham","Right, the total is the 400 million to 500 million correct?","Greg Garland","That is right, right and we've said that roughly 80% of our EBITDA is in the fee based arrangement as we look at the Midstream 20% commodity this is one of those projects that will have some degree of commodity opportunity or arb but it's not the predominant piece of this would still be fee based.","Phil Gresham","Last question just on distillates, or just on general on refining products, how much do you export in the quarter and if you could just give us your thoughts on the distillate export fundamentals in light of weakening margins in the rest of world Asia specifically?","Greg Garland","So the 100, we had a little for 140,000 barrels a day last quarter, most of that was distillate and it's really Gulf Coast oriented Alliance is back on line. So we've opportunities in Latin America I think Asia is feeling the impact of the start up of Middle East but that\u2019s really not have been a large trade area for us out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. So I think that the opportunities are likely to still be there, U.S. is still there, Gulf Coast is still very competitive in that market. And so I think the Atlantic Basin will still remain the natural trade area, and it is really going to be a pull I think on gasoline distillate that you have a U.S. or European shale versus another international opportunity but I think we've been relatively flat on export U.S. for some time and I don't expect that to really change.","Operator","Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs is one line with a question.","Neil Mehta","So in the quarter it looks you returned about 60% to 65% of the earnings in terms of the buyback in dividend. Is that a reasonable run rate as we think on -- as we look forward and how do you think about the allocation of the buyback versus dividends here?","Greg Garland","The guidance we've been giving is it would be consistent today it's kind of 60-40. And if the cash from all sources 60% from go in reinvestment 40% is going to be returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as long as we are trends of value we\u2019re going to be buying shares and we\u2019re buying shares every day. You want to look at it on basis of others we've 71% of net income turns distributions back to shareholders. I don't really think about it on that basis, but I think about it on a cash basis, and I think about it in terms of intrinsic value long-term.","Neil Mehta","And based on those comments it seems like you guys are going to continue to lean into the buyback relative to the dividend based on what you think the intrinsic value of the PSX is?","Greg Garland","I think it\u2019s both I mean we've given guidance that 2014, 2015, 2016 expect double-digit dividend increases we\u2019re good with that, and then share repurchase is going to be there.","Neil Mehta","And then 2016 the commentary that CapEx likely down a $1 billion recognizing that we\u2019ll wait a couple of months to get more granularity in terms of the specific projects but at least directionally can you talk about some things that are rolling off '15 to '16 that will help us get there.","Greg Garland","Well certainly we\u2019ll finish the frac and you got the LPG export facility still yet to complete but DAPL still under construction at that point Bayou bridge the connectivity around Beaumont that we\u2019re looking at. So I mean there we've plenty of projects. I think as you think about this year was really a heavy last year for us with 4.8 billion in capital and we've consciously dialed that down on a go forward basis.","Neil Mehta","And then last question for me is just in terms of we\u2019re just seeing through the wholesale network and then on the retail network then you are connected there from a demand standpoint and any granularity by product would be helpful as well?","Greg Garland","I think fundamentally we view at that 3% to 4%.","Greg Maxwell","And originally Tim I don\u2019t know if you are seeing differences.","Tim Taylor","It's kind of across the U.S. the vehicle model is driven or up, you can get that stat and look at MasterCard date and look at EIA. We look at our unbranded branded rack sales and we kind off see those numbers in that rig. So it just tends to all come together in that 3% to 4% range and it\u2019s across the U.S. good response in California for instance as well, but we\u2019re really seeing that around the U.S. So I think generally the driving public on the gasoline side is responded to lower prices but by travelling more and that\u2019s being supported now I think across as you look at all the data sources across that. So I think as long as gasoline prices stay in this range we\u2019re continue to see increases in gasoline demand from last year.","Operator","And this concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell for closing remarks.","Kevin Mitchell","Thank you very much for participating in the call today. We do appreciate your interest in the company.

My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only-mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Clayton Reasor, Senior Vice President Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Affairs. You may begin.","C. Clayton Reasor","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Phillips 66 third quarter earnings conference call. With me this morning are Chairman and CEO, Greg Garland; CFO, Greg Maxwell; and EVP, Tim Taylor. This morning\u2019s presentation material can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information.","Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It's a reminder that we'll be making forward-looking comments during the presentation and our question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here on the second page of the presentation as well as in our filings with the SEC.","So with that said, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg Garland for some opening remarks. Greg?","Greg C. Garland","Thanks Clayton. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. During the third quarter, the refining market environment became more challenging than what we experienced over the past two years. Market crack declined over 20% compared to the last quarter and from an earnings perspective, our refining business broke even this quarter.","On a positive note, we ran better and this improved reliability allowed our chemical and midstream businesses to contribute the majority of our earnings this quarter. Also our Marketing and Specialties businesses had another solid quarter generating over $200 million in earnings. We generated $1.9 billion in operating cash flow and was $900 million if you exclude the impact of working capital. We also received over $1 billion in proceeds from asset sales. The ability to generate cash when refining market conditions are poor gives us the confidence that we continue to grow and sustain shareholder distributions.","Since August of last year, we\u2019ve repurchased over 34 million shares completing our initial $2 billion program. In October, we began repurchasing shares under our additional $1 billion program. Also we\u2019ve almost doubled over dividend. Earlier this month, we announced our latest dividend increase raising it 25% to $0.39 per share.","We\u2019ve also used our strong operating cash flows to strengthen our balance sheet. In total we\u2019ve reduced debt by $2 billion since the spin from ConocoPhillips about year and a half ago. Our capital structure, our strategic positioning enables us to increase capital spending and distributions in spite of our exposure to highly volatile crack spreads and crude diffs.","Our financial flexibility is an important differentiator. We have the balance sheet. We have the capacity to increase our leverage as needed throughout the market cycles. Given our exposure to refining margins, we think our debt levels are appropriate for now and we don't plan any further reduction of debt. We believe that an important use of our cash is funding the expansion of our higher valued businesses. Our platform for growth is unmatched by any other company in the refining space. We are committed to growing our Midstream and Chemicals businesses and on a more selective basis our Marketing and Specialties businesses.","In Midstream, we intend to use our MLP to grow and create value. Until our MLP is large enough to fund projects of the scale and scope we envision, we expect that first we\u2019ll incubate the project at Phillips 66 and eventually drop them in to Phillips 66 Partners. Potential candidates for this approach would include the 100,000 barrel-per-day NGL fractionator at our Sweeny complex along with the associated infrastructure.","In addition, we are developing an LPG export terminal project at Freeport, Texas. The LPG export facility is expected to enable us to take advantage of the Company's existing midstream transportation and towards infrastructure. Combining these two projects represented two discrete $1 billion investment over the next 2 to 3 years. Ultimately once we're up and running at full capacity we expect these projects to generate on the order of $400 million to $500 million of EBITDA annually.","Startup of the frac is expected in 2015 with the export facility following closely to 2016. We\u2019ve seen increasing number of opportunities to participate in the NGL market and we will use our midstream business to supply petrochemical, heating and transportation markets globally. The combination of refining free cash flow and our MLP provides us with a unique position and options to accelerate our growth in the midstream space.","Our joint venture DCP Midstream also has growth projects in place. Over the last couple of years it is expected to spend $2 billion to $4 billion in capital and we would expect the DCP Midstream will use its MLP as a funding vehicle for most of these projects.","Our Chemicals business is focused on growing in the feedstock advantaged U.S. Gulf Coast. This region is second only to the Middle East for low-cost feedstock availability. Earlier this month CPChem announced FID for its world-scale Gulf Coast ethane cracker and two new polyethylene facilities.","CPChem now has the necessary approvals to begin construction. In addition to the petrochemicals projects CPChem is also completing one hexane unit which is expected to be operational in the first half of 2014 as well at the Sweeny ethylene expansion in 2014. All in CPChem at a 100% basis is expected to spend between $6 million and $8 billion on self-funded capital between now and 2017. They expect to add about $1.5 billion of EBITDA in 2017 once all these growth projects are online.","In Marketing and Specialties, we will grow selectively. Over the next five years we plan to add about 200 retail sites in Europe and expect these high efficiency assets to generate returns in excess of 25%. With regard to refining for us it is about enhancing returns through operating excellence and optimization across our system.","The largest lever to improve return on capital employed is getting advantaged feedstocks at the front of our facilities. We continue to look for opportunities at present our largest one is to get advantaged crudes to our East Coast and West Coast refineries.","In addition, as U.S. demand for refined products declined we believe that increasing export capabilities is going to be important to keep our refineries running at high utilization rates. We have seven coastal refineries in the U.S., we currently have 340,000 barrels a day of export capability, and we plan on growing this to 500,000 barrels a day over the next several years.","Our exports increased again this past quarter. Given the third quarter, we exported 190,000 barrels a day, that\u2019s the fourth consecutive quarterly increase in exports for us.","As we start thinking about 2014, we would expect that our 2014 capital spending to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. If you include our non-consolidation portion of capital from DCP, CPChem, and WRB, we expect that the total capital program to be in the order of $4 billion to $5 billion. Half of that\u2019s going to be in Midstream, a quarter of that will be in Chemical and the balance will be primarily in Refining, Marketing and Specialties.","We will give you more comprehensive review of our capital program in December following our Board approval. I can\u2019t think of a more exciting time to be in this business. Refining as well it is, it\u2019s always going to be a very volatile business. What\u2019s changed is the American energy landscape, the technology driven access to tight oils and natural gas to NGLs. And as an integrated downstream energy manufacturing logistics company, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to participate in the American energy revolution that\u2019s going on today.","So with that as opening comments, I am going to turn over to Greg to go through the quarter results. Greg?","Greg G. Maxwell","Thanks, Greg. Good morning everyone. Before getting started I want to take a moment to point out a couple of items in today\u2019s presentation. First, the presentation today will focus on a sequential quarter basis, rather than a year-over-year basis. Given the differences in the refining markets between 2012 and 2013, a comparison of this quarter\u2019s results with those of the previous quarter provides more insight into the drivers of our earnings variances. However we continue to supply year-over-year comparisons and these can be found in the Appendix on our website.","Second, as disclosed in May, we entered into an agreement to sell the Immingham Combined Heat and Power Plant or ICHP. During the third quarter, we completed that sale, however I should note that we have signed a confidentiality agreement with the buyer of ICHP and as such we are not allowed to provide any additional information on this transaction and we will not be able to address any questions that have not already been addressed or disclosed in our previous SEC filings.","So starting now with Slide 4, third quarter earnings were $535 million or $0.87 per share. There were no adjustments to our reported earnings for the third quarter. Excluding changes in working capital, cash from operations for the quarter was $873 million. We paid a $189 million in dividends, we repurchased $674 million or 11.6 million shares of our common stock during the quarter and we also repaid the remaining $500 million outstanding under our term loan. On an adjusted basis, our annualized year-to-date return on capital employed was 14%.","Slide 5 provides a comparison of our third quarter adjusted earnings with the second quarter on a segment basis. As you can see compared to last quarter, earnings decreased primarily due to lower refining margins or refining earnings partially offsetting this increase are increases in earnings from our chemicals and midstream businesses. I\u2019ll cover each of these segments in more detail later on.","Moving on to our third quarter cash flow. Cash from operations excluding working capital was nearly $900 million and this was sufficient to fund our dividends as well as our capital program. In addition, we generated cash from working capital as well as asset sales and then we also had the proceed from the IPO of our MLP. The positive changes in working capital were largely due to the impacts of higher prices driving an increase in accounts payable along with changes in inventories.","For the fourth quarter, we currently expect a $500 million to $600 million use of working capital and this will primarily be tied to a reduction in taxes payable. We continue to buyback shares under our share repurchase program while continuing our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet.","During the quarter we repurchased nearly $700 million in shares and we repaid the remaining $500 million outstanding under our three year term loan. We ended the quarter with $5.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and this includes the consolidation of about $420 million of cash held by PSXP.","Looking forward, we expect capital spending in the fourth quarter to be heavier than the previous quarters of 2013 as we progressed towards completion of a $1.9 billion capital target. In addition as previously mentioned we expect an overall use of working capital in the fourth quarter and we also expect to continue our share repurchase program along with our dividend payments. Together we expect these items reduce our year end cash balance compared to this quarter.","As far capital structure depicted on the next slide. At the end of the third quarter we had equity of $22 billion. On the debt slide as previously mentioned we paid down the remaining $500 million outstanding under our term loan. However during the quarter we also entered into approximately $200 million in capital leases resulting in an overall ending debt balances of $6.2 billion. Our debt to capital ratio was 22% which is at the lower end of our targeted range.","Next we\u2019ll cover each of our segments in more detail, starting with Midstream on Slide 8. The Midstream segment includes three business lines. It includes transportation, it includes our equity investment in DCP Midstream and it also includes NGL Operations and Other. This segment posted strong earnings this quarter with earnings up more than 60% compared to last quarter. The annualized year-to-date adjusted return on capital employed for Midstream was 15% and this is based on an average capital employed of $3.2 billion.","Slide 9 shows Midstream\u2019s earnings of $148 million, representing an increase of $58 million from the prior quarter. Transportation was up $4 million, mainly driven by higher volumes, which includes increases from refinery utilization as well as new rates. Earnings from DCO Midstream increased by $57 million this quarter and this was primarily due to the impacts of hedges associated with asset dropdowns to DCP Midstream Partners, equity gains resulting from DPM\u2019s unit issuances to the public and also higher margins and volumes. So no significant earnings variances for NGL Operations and Other compared with the second quarter.","On the next slide we\u2019ll move on to a discussion on our Chemical segment. Sequentially our Chemical segment results improved 45% and this was primarily due to less downtime in the United States. Global capacity utilization for olefins and polyolefins was 87% for the quarter and was over 90% in the U.S. The annualized year-to-date return on capital employed from our Chemical segment was 26% and this was based on an average capital employed of $3.7 billion.","As shown on Slide 11, third quarter earnings for chemicals increased by $81 million compared to last quarter. CPChem continues to focus on operating excellence and they reduced their downtime in olefins and polyolefins compared with last quarter. This was a large contributor to the increase in their earnings as CPChem was able to capitalize on the strong petrochemicals margin environment.","Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics\u2019 earnings were flat compared with the prior quarter as higher volumes and lower cost were offset by lower benzene and specialty chemicals margins. The decrease of $6 million in Corporate and Other is primarily due to higher effective tax rate in the current quarter, largely as a result of the mix in foreign and domestic taxable income.","As we move next to refining, our realized margin was $6.14 per barrel with a global crude utilization rate of 95% and a clean product yield of 84%.","Our advantage crude sale in the U.S. was 66% this quarter and that\u2019s down from 68% last quarter. This decrease is mainly tied to Bakken and albeit in the economically advantaged during the third quarter and the scheduled turnaround at our Ponca City Refinery. The annualized year-to-date adjusted return on capital employed for the refining segment was 13% with an average capital employed for the segment of $14.1 billion.","Slide 13 provides more detail on earnings in our refining segment. Our refining segment reported a loss of $2 million this quarter. This is down $483 million from the prior quarter primarily due to lower margins particularly in the Central Corridor, Western Pacific and other refining. While the Central Corridor and Western Pacific regions where down due to decreased market cracks and other refining results were lower this quarter largely driven by lower earnings from utilizing the excess capacity on pipelines that import Canadian crude.","Compared with the second quarter, the Canadian to mid [indiscernible] narrowed $4 to $6 per barrel resulting in a significantly lower gains in the third quarter. In addition, third quarter was further reduced by foreign exchange related impacts. Let's now take a look at our market capture shown on slide 14.","Our worldwide realized margin this quarter was $6.14 per barrel with a market capture of 46%. This compares to $9.88 a barrel and 56% capture in the second quarter. Capture was down this quarter compared to the last primarily due to secondary product prices remaining relatively flat while feedstock prices rose.","Also the previously mentioned lower earnings related to utilizing excess pipeline capacity further impacted our overall capture. As discussed on previous calls we continue to incur rents cost in our refining segment, these costs are reflected in the other bar along with inventory and product differential impacts.","Moving on to slide 15, slide 15 shows the comparison of advantage crude runs at our refineries as well as clean product yields for 2011, 2012 and year-to-date 2013. In the U.S. our advantage crude slate was increased from 62% in 2012 to 67% in 2013. The decrease in other heavy crude from 27% to 24% is attributed mainly to the downtime at our Lake Charles and Sweeney refineries this year.","As shown on the graph on the right, we continue to focus on improving our clean product yields, achieving an overall 84% yield across our refining system this year. The decline in distillate yields in 2013 compared with 2012 is primarily the result of the mix of refineries that were down this year compared to last. This includes scheduled turnarounds, which are typically on a five-year cycle.","This next slide covers our Marketing and Specialties segment or M&S. Worldwide marketing margins were $4.4 per gallon in the third quarter and while our Refining segment experienced higher RINs cost in the quarter, M&S benefited from higher RINs values created by its renewable fuel winning activities. The annualized year-to-date adjusted return for M&S was 36% and this was based on an average capital employed of $2.8 billion.","Slide 17 provide some additional detail about our M&S segment. Earnings for M&S in the third quarter of 2013 were $240 million. This is a $69 million decrease from adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Marketing and others earnings decreased $60 million, mostly driven by lower product margins. Partially offsetting this were higher margins on renewable fuel blending. Specialties\u2019 decrease over the prior quarter was mainly related to our exit of the composite graphite and E-Gas Licensing businesses. This was partially offset by higher volumes.","Moving on to Corporate and Other, this segment includes net interest expense, corporate overhead costs, technology and other costs not allocated to our operating segments. Corporate and Other costs were $113 million after-tax for the third quarter compared with $126 million for the previous quarter. The improvement of $30 million was mainly driven by lower environmental expenses, which were included in the Other category.","This concludes my discussion of the financial and operational results for the quarter. Next, I\u2019ll cover a few outlook items. For Chemicals, for the fourth quarter we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the low to mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the fourth quarter global utilization rates to be in the low 90s. And looking at turnarounds, our pre-tax turnaround expense is expected to be between $150 million to $170 million in the fourth quarter. And then in Corporate and Other, we continue to expect our cost to be in the $105 million to $110 million range on an after tax basis. And then finally we expect the Company\u2019s total effective tax rate to be in the mid-30s.","With that, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Doug Terreson of ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Good morning everybody.","Greg C. Garland","Good morning.","Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","I have a couple of questions on refining; first, the Company has significantly increased the use of advantage crudes during the past couple of years with significant benefits. Well it maybe hard to know, I want to see whether Greg, can talk a little bit about how much running room that the Company might have in this area in coming years.","And then second, the unfavorable delta for secondary products seemed to increase in each of the major regions especially on the Gulf Coast and Central Corridor and I think Greg attributed this to rising feedstock cost. And so I just want to see if there is any additional color on that decline and also would note anything specific to those regions that cause them to be effective more than the others?","Greg C. Garland","So I\u2019ll take a stab and then Tim, and Greg can kind of help answer the questions. So you think about the running room, we eventually get to 100% of advantage crude across the refineries. That\u2019s some combination of getting more crude east and west because that\u2019s where we still have the opportunities when you think about Bayway, and you think about the West Coast refineries.","Rail is the key piece of that. We are adding capabilities, we\u2019re taking more cars by the end of this year, we think will have all the 2,000 cars in place that we\u2019ve purchased. We are thinking about buying some more railcars. We certainly have a large project underway at Bayway to be able to unload at Bayway 75 a day. And so, we are trying to get Bayway position where we can get it on a pretty steady guide of Bakken and then we have the Jones Act vessels run Eagle Ford around to Bayway.","So, we are working that. The thing I would say is we\u2019ve said this for a while, as we do think that crudes like LLS become an advantage crude for us on the Gulf Coast. And so by the day we would want to add in the 500,000 barrels a day of Brent based crudes they were running ultimately it becomes an advantage crude and I do think between what our sales and others are doing on the West Coast, we are going to pressure ANS prices and so ANS whether it be in a Brent based type crude it becomes an advantage crude.","So that partly is what the actions we\u2019re taking, what the actions others are taking that put pressure on some of these crudes. And so I think we do get the 100% of advantaged crudes over the next couple of years.","Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Secondary product?","Greg C. Garland","Yes, secondary product, so crude prices went up 8% to 12%. So WTI was up 12%, Brent is up 8% this quarter over the last quarter and our prices stayed flat for a while with the secondary products and so that\u2019s when we saw with the compression.","Timothy G. Taylor","","Primarily coke and NGL prices, Doug, did not keep up pace with the crude price.","Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Greg C. Garland","You bet.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning guys.","Greg C. Garland","Hi, Evan.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Congrats on the FID, reaching FID. You\u2019re getting approval by the Board in reaching FID in your ethane cracker in the Gulf Coast. Is there any discussion at this stage of what the CapEx, what the cost might be and how do you see the funding mechanism, and then also you talked about potentially sequencing a second cracker, I mean how does that fall into the timeline going forward?","Timothy G. Taylor","Yes, Evan, this is Tim Taylor. So in terms of the capital cost of the cracker and derivates complex in the Gulf Coast, we\u2019ve said that were approximately $6 billion on that. So in terms of a second cracker project in the Gulf Coast, at CPChem they continue to look around the globe where to build a cost competitive advantage feedstock cracker. That\u2019s key business for them and frankly the U.S. continues to look good. It maybe a little bit different in terms of feedstock slate to provide some flexibility, but as you look around the world, the North America \u2013 the energy market with NGLs continues to be a place where you could say that a second wave of cracker expansions of those supply continue to develop that makes sense.","So I think that that\u2019s certainly there. The timeline for that, if you haven\u2019t started that, it\u2019s six years to seven years from the time that you begin conceptual thinking to actually getting in the ground. So you are pushing out probably toward the end of this decade, the very early part of next decade before you\u2019d expect to see probably at this point another significant amount of cracker expansions in the U.S. Gulf Coast.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. My second question, on chemicals, you guys had a great quarter in chemicals. Could you give us a color how the Saudi cracker is performing versus your expectation drift and while U.S. ethylene chain margins have sustained over $0.40 a pound due to lower ethane prices, what kind of chain margins are you seeing or realizing at the Saudi cracker and how would they compare globally?","Greg C. Garland","","So when you look at the Middle East versus North America on an ethane basis, it\u2019s generally in the same ballpark slightly advantaged from that standpoint to the Middle East crackers typically.","So I\u2019d say margins are good. The real challenge in the Middle East continues to be from the Saudi crackers specifically. We continue to experience some unplanned downtime related to shaking out and getting some technical issues resolved on that. So if margins are strong, demand is good globally for those products and so really it comes down to the operating rate and that\u2019s been coming up, but we\u2019re still not where we want to be.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Okay. Good. And then lastly if I could, just any update on potential refining divestitures and you continue also just remind me of what kind of working capital release you\u2019d realize if they were sold?","Greg C. Garland","","So we continue to always abide with our portfolio and we\u2019ve guided there. We said publicly that we\u2019re looking at selling possibly our Whitegate refinery in Ireland and our interest in the Melaka refinery in Malaysia, and so those efforts continue. We\u2019re in the process of evaluating specifically the opportunities around Whitegate. So I think those have been the pieces of portfolio for us that long-term are really where the strategic interest is.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Any update on what the working capital release of Whitegate?","Greg G. Maxwell","","Working capital release would be significant. So that\u2019s a piece of what we look at in terms of the valuation.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, I appreciate you guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Yes. Good morning. I just have a small follow-up. First on the supplementary products, I mean just on the yields of that sort of 15% that\u2019s not clean products, I mean just a rough run-through of what the main products are. And then, on NGL price we can obviously track that, but coke pricing, is that sort of market based or is there a contract and do things re-price over time given that the spike in crude just to help us model the outlook.","Greg G. Maxwell","","So it\u2019s primarily LPG that comes out on the other products that comes out on the refining processes, but coke is clearly the byproduct so to speak of the coking operations. LPG prices are linked, as you know you can get a public marker on those, going back to NGL and the supply demand on the LPG market.","Coke, we have a couple of segments there. We have a specialty coke business, which is a high-valued business and that\u2019s going on a very different basis than we also make other anode coke as well as fuel-grade coke, and clearly some of the fuel-grade coke is related to coal prices. So I think you get some idea of what happened in the coal market as natural gas continue to penetrate North America in that. So, coke prices tend not to move directly with the crude in the short-term. It\u2019s just a variety of contract structures with that.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Great. And then some extra color, maybe I\u2019ve just noticed it from the first time on your BX4 facility and the incremental EBITDA for chemicals, which is very helpful, thanks very much. But a broader question on logistics, I mean obviously you got PSXP, you\u2019ve got your share of the Sand, Southern Hills. You\u2019ve got $430 million of EBITDA coming when this Gulf Coast project comes on stream. Another big chunk I guess was going to be from sort of shifting the logistics in refining and marketing sort of more market based tariffs. Can you talk through how that is progressing and maybe any other logistics growth drivers that I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t mentioned in my question?","Greg C. Garland","","We\u2019ve got just a tremendous set of opportunities in that Midstream space, the large one as you mentioned were the frac opportunity and the LPG which were continuing to develop on the engineering stage, and committing substantial engineering dollars and long lead equipment items on that as we progress that toward FID which we would hope to be early next year.","So beyond that there is just a number of pipeline connections and smaller things that we\u2019re looking at smaller projects that build on our base around both NGL and the refining part of our network. So smaller projects that can be executed a little more quickly, but the big driver in the midstream is that frac and export terminal. And so we just continue to see a whole opportunity to develop that logistics infrastructure around the NGL export gas base kind of opportunity, and being around for advantage crude into the front end of our refineries that Greg talked about as well as some opportunities on the refined product side.","And so I think I look at that and I just see substantial opportunity. As far as market based tariffs go, we\u2019re continuing to progress that and we\u2019re making those adjustments and you can see that show up this quarter in terms of the improvement that we\u2019ve made. So I think we are pretty much through in our existing system with that as we progress that from a cost base system into a market base. So I think going forward the real growth in the midstream comes from our own internal expansion at Phillips 66 and then of course our interest in the DCP Midstream venture that we have with Spectra.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","So just to be clear that the step up I guess in midstream 2Q to 3Q, a lot of that means that repricing is now done and that\u2019s a good base from which to add only capital driven growth projects?","Greg C. Garland","Yes, we still continue to work through all those but largely that\u2019s getting in place and so the real step up in terms of the potential comes from new pipeline connections, new opportunities and then these major capital projects we talked about.","Greg G. Maxwell","","Great, and then maybe assets that are currently inside the refining expense whether it's rail unloading facilities or docks or items that are not in transportation today, that we may carve out of refining and put into the transportation in midstream segment.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Okay, great thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Well, thanks, good morning everybody. The capital guidance for maintenance, your guidance here I guess my question was really about what seems some of your peers get involved with to take advantage of some of the weak parts of the burrow on NGL, and then we are building out inflection point and so on. You guys have been fairly verse to putting new capital into refining. I'm just curious if there was any change of thinking there given how weak or so on a forward basis. And I have a follow-up to this?","Timothy G. Taylor","","Okay. Thanks good morning. We're going to continue to ensuring capital and going in refining. I tell the guys that bring me all of the 40% return of projects you\u2019ve got and we\u2019ll fund those. We\u2019ll fund the advantage crude, we are going to fund the infrastructure around exports and refining, but frankly we just have better opportunities in our higher value businesses around Midstream and Chemicals and we take refining free cash and sell it to those higher value businesses. I think you will see us be very consistent around that.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay. And my follow-up really relates to the West Coast, I guess you went through a period were West Coast got a little bit better there for a while, but periodically with regards to sales and others, talk about the challenges of operating in the market. So when you think about the broader portfolio migrating as you move forward, how is the West Coast standing up against the rest of the assets right now and I will leave you there? Thanks.","Greg G. Maxwell","","We look at the West Coast and we see average assets in our portfolio. The net income positive or cash positive, single-digit return type for the most part you look over to [indiscernible] selling those guys, single point in time forecast are really dangerous in this business. So you want to be careful with that. But as we look at those assets that I would say that we're going to consider all options to increase value of those assets. And clearly for us getting an advantage crude in the front of those refineries is a big piece of the value equation. ","Now I think the jury is still out on what happens with the Monterey in California. And if something happened there that would change our view and I think we would be open to joint venturing those assets, IPO-ing those assets, think about alternative structures for those assets. But first we\u2019re going to put advantaged crude to the front of those and improve the performance of that. I\u2019d say that we don\u2019t feel pressure that we have to do something quickly on those assets. We can take our time and evaluate those assets.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","If I can move to on a follow-on just on that issue, yesterday you had rather talked about how a potential environmental study could be there, we move to take advantaged crude to the West Coast. I\u2019m just curious if you could frame for us how you see any timeline from a well\u2019s [ph] perspective just how quickly you could effectively achieve that?","Greg C. Garland","","Well, we\u2019re certainly working on our own projects and we\u2019re working with others. I would say that they are progressing. I think we have a high-level of confidence that we\u2019re going to be able to address those issues and get those projects completed and underway.","Greg G. Maxwell","","I would also say we are looking at multiple ways of getting crude into California, whether it\u2019s unit train unloading or barge into both with AO and LA have water balloon capabilities. So we tried to attack it from a couple of different directions.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","All right, thanks guys. I\u2019ll let someone else jump. Thank you.","Greg C. Garland","","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","","Good morning.","Greg C. Garland","","Hi, Jeff.","","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","","You mentioned this morning that you\u2019ve taken 1,270 of your 2,000 railcars and you\u2019re expecting the remainder by the end of the year. Could you talk about the most optimal use of those railcars in the current environment? Is it mainly for going to Bayway or how are you planning on utilizing those cars?","Greg C. Garland","","I think primarily we still see the railcars clearing northern production to the East and the West Coast. So our current thinking is that those railcars will be primarily in service to both Ferndale and into Bayway and as we developed the California options, I think some opportunities there as well. But really it\u2019s more around using the railcars to access either Canadian and\/or Bakken crude to move those into the coastal systems, primarily the East and the West.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","","Thank you. And secondly, with LLS large Maya discounts as steep as they are in the Gulf Coast, are they being \u2013 you are trying to do to lock-in some of those benefits either in the Gulf Coast or perhaps shipping via barge to Bayway. How are you looking to take advantage of these discounts?","","Greg G. Maxwell","","Yes, I think that when we look to the broader system we continue to increase our use of Eagle Ford and crudes in our system, and so the marine opportunities exist for us to bring those crudes into Louisiana as well as around the Bayway as Greg referenced earlier. So I think it\u2019s just increased the opportunity really around the marine movements to use those crudes in the Gulf Coast now up to East Coast finally.","Greg C. Garland","Philosophically as far as locking in margins or we typically don\u2019t do that given the optionality of our system. We think that people own us for that exposure. It\u2019s hard to know whether LLS widens or narrows from where it is today given all the factors that are on the market. So we typically don\u2019t hedge crude diffs or market cracks.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Hey, guys, good morning.","Greg C. Garland","Hey, Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","A number of quick questions. For 2014 the credit say $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Given the project that is currently on your paper, is that a reasonable range for the next three or four years?","Greg C. Garland","Yes.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Or that is going to come down from there?","Greg C. Garland","Yes, I think it\u2019s probably a reasonable range for the infrastructure that we see in front of us that we want to do. Essentially you\u2019re going to incubate projects at the PSX level that ultimately probably get destined for PSXP until we can grow the scale in MLP to the point that they can either co-invest or can execute projects on its own, but, yes I would say. So I mean the frac and export facility, we think it\u2019s $2 billion to $3 billion over the next two-three years. ","You can get another $1 billion a year of capital spend on kind of what we\u2019re doing now at $2 billion level. I mean that\u2019s how we got to the guidance and we\u2019re still working on that and we still need go to an approval process with our Board that at least we\u2019re kind of exposing our thinking here, Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Okay. That\u2019s good. Greg, will you be wanting that you tell us that \u2013 share with us what is the RIN benefit in your marketing in the quarter?","Greg C. Garland","Same answer as last time, Paul, but thank you for asking.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","All right. Try another one. Can you tell us that what is in the third quarter, volume of oil from well to your refinery in the East, the West and the Gulf?","Greg C. Garland","I\u2019m sorry. The volume of oil\u2026","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","That was gained a rail to the East Coast, the West Coast or the Gulf Coast?","Greg C. Garland","Do we know \u2013 I know our rail capacity in third quarter is probably lower because of the Bakken\u2026","Greg G. Maxwell","We ship less. We made less rail shipments to Bakken to Bayway in response to the closing there. That\u2019s opening back up and so we\u2019re ramping back up. Today, rail movements for us in total are probably a little less than 100,000 barrels. So clearly we are ramping up our capacity. So it\u2019s kind of roughly in that ballpark of what we got.","Timothy G. Taylor","Yes, I think at one point we were railing around the 100,000 a day in the Bayway and we cut that to 30,000 barrels a day, I think in August through September. So obviously, 70,000 barrels a day of rail capacity. We took off and just put those cars on the siting and started importing West African or North Sea crudes.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","[indiscernible] should we assume that the fourth quarter average is going to be at least 50,000 barrel per day to 75,000 barrel per day higher in terms of the rail going, given how the substance or just the discount rates now.","Greg C. Garland","When we look at the differentials that\u2019s going to drive\u2026","Greg G. Maxwell","Yes, we\u2019re returning to much more like we were in the second quarter.","Greg C. Garland","Expect those wells will start turning.","Greg G. Maxwell","Right.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Okay. So is there any rough idea that how much is the increase we maybe talking? We\u2019re talking about incrementally from the third quarter say 50,000 barrel per day or incrementally 100,000 barrel per day, any kind of rough number you can share?","Greg G. Maxwell","Yes. You\u2019ve got both more cars and you\u2019ve got wider diffs. But I think we\u2019re always a little reluctant to talk about how much more we\u2019re buying from any specific fields. We don\u2019t think it necessarily helps us our commercial guys that are out there buying the crude. I think we\u2019re comfortable in saying it\u2019s going to be higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, but I don\u2019t think we want to quantify how much of an increase that will be. I don\u2019t see what you feel.","Paula Johnson","","It\u2019s Paula. It\u2019s not a huge debt change, but it\u2019s getting back more in line like I said in the second quarter.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Can you remind me what was the second quarter warning?","Paula Johnson","I think when you look at those charts you get some idea of the light tight oil and it\u2019s going back and we\u2019re trying to grow that, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about there. We don\u2019t utilize that logistics capacity more fully to do that than we did. So that\u2019s kind of where I\u2019d like to refer you to is kind of take a look at that.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Tim, when you buy the Bakken or the WCS you buy one month out right. So you essentially that by now we pretty much that know 2.5 month of the discount that you\u2019re going to receive in the fourth quarter. Is that how you guys do it?","Greg G. Maxwell","","Yes, we buy out. So our commercial group looks at the market fundamentals and makes that call and so I think we are clearly on the opportunity listed here in the fourth quarter pretty early. So we\u2019re able to \u2013 I think they were ahead of that plan from our perspective on that.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","A final one, just hell of curiosity, I mean in October looked like with the lower re-price and also that their wholesale margin seems to be improving. Should we assume that from a re-finding margin capture rate standpoint third quarter, you hit the low point and fourth quarter should be substantially better than that.","Greg G. Maxwell","","We\u2019re reluctant to give guidance on capture rates, I think given where the prices are today, you would come to that conclusion but it\u2019s hard for us to make a call on what fourth quarter capture.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Diffs in October so far you\u2019ve seen, is it much better than the third quarter?","Greg G. Maxwell","","So diffs are definitely better but I would say the market cracks are down month to date. So it\u2019s a tough one to sort your way through on that one Paul. So we are not giving guidance, I would just say you look at the month of October, what\u2019s out there in terms of the market cracks they\u2019re down versus third quarter, but diffs are much better.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Greg C. Garland","","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning everyone.","Greg C. Garland","Good morning.","Greg G. Maxwell","","Good morning.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","This seems plenty of pieces about your long-term strategy and individual components I guess I should say with the FID in the ethylene cracker and talking about rationalizing and refining. Can you give us an overarching target for 2017 in terms of whether you have a number or an idea of the balance of the business in terms of capital employed or how we should expect you to be managing this variety of strategic initiatives that you\u2019ve talked about? Thanks.","Greg C. Garland","","Yes, so in our presentations that we\u2019ve been giving to investors that you seem clearly with the pie charts if you remember we want to see refining under 50% of our income, capital employed is a little difficult to measure because of the JVs and the way you count for joint ventures. But clearly when we think about income, we want to see a 30% to 40% refining, and we\u2019ll see Marketing and Specialties, Midstream, Chemicals and the other 60% to 70% of our earnings call. And what we are trying to do is rather than the five year plan, how we get there in three years.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Right, okay, that\u2019s good, I just we\u2019ve had various questions that you\u2019re kind of addressing us. I just wanted to remain everyone of the overarching strategy. Also I wanted to ask a high level question before I ask a really nerdy one, which is on working capital is there a shift with the U.S. unconventional revolution that we should think about. The items that you gave, you have a big working capital number in this past quarter $1 billion shift, but it seems that the reasons for that were fairly mundane, I think you mentioned inventory and other fairly usual items.","I wanted if there is a biggest theme here in terms of the greater use of rail maybe the greater use of pipes and so on that might be a the theme if you like in terms of how working capital is going to shift of that obviously by potential disposals and that theme in terms of working capital? Thanks.","Greg G. Maxwell","Yes, Paul. This is Greg Maxwell. As part of our fundamental shift, I don\u2019t see a big trend out there as far as the way our business is running. We did as we mentioned in our notes and as you saw in the chart, we did have about $1 billion source in working capital in the third quarter. So I mentioned in my notes, we think that that will turn a bit in the fourth quarter, $500 million to $600 million primarily as related to some tax payments, but if you look at the components of what drove that $1 billion, it was pretty much across all the elements of working capital.","For example, we had to draw in inventories in the third quarter, but more than offsetting that was an increase in our accounts payable and a lot of that was result of the \u2013 as we saw the crude prices going up that increased our payables slightly in the third quarter. So overall, I don\u2019t see a real fundamental shift with regard to the levels of our working capital as we change our business processes.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, I got it. I mean, I guess that\u2019s interesting. I think one theme is the idea that trains require less working capital than pipes?","Timothy G. Taylor","That is true.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So you\u2019d be more incentive to develop more train transport than pipe transport as a general rule?","Greg C. Garland","So a fairly small percentage, if you look at that compared to what we have in the pipes. So you are right as far as directionally which way it go, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge needle mover.","","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, that\u2019s interesting.","Greg G. Maxwell","I will just say, you think about the 2,000 railcars, we can move 120 a day, we have a global deal, we can move 75 a day. So with the existing assets and infrastructure we have, we can maybe move 200 a day, 250 a day and then you think about all, we are moving 3 million barrels a day in our whole system.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right.","Greg G. Maxwell","Yes, and then of course it\u2019s the whole MLP theme as well to think to about I guess in terms of.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, anyway, thanks a lot.","Greg G. Maxwell","","Yes.","Greg C. Garland","Okay, Paul.","","Timothy G. Taylor","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bradley Olsen of Tudor Pickering. Please go ahead.","","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey good morning guys.","Greg C. Garland","Good morning.","Greg G. Maxwell","","Hi, Brad.","","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","You guys have done a great job articulating a consistent strategy whereby you become larger in Midstream and Chemicals with refining staying flat or even potentially shrinking. So now just based on your comments earlier, it sounds as though, this could be more of a three to four year target referring to the pie chart that you put in your corporate presentations rather than a five plus year target.","Do the volatile capture rates that we have been seeing recently and some of the softness in gasoline and maybe the various view on refining as an industry that you\u2019ve expressed pretty consistently over the last couple of years, lead you to start thinking about different assets as potentially being non-core, maybe even assets that are North American refining assets and maybe even some assets that are in the mid continent or the Gulf Coast region?","Greg C. Garland","","Well, what I would say is we do like the refining business. As you think about it we got here this quarter, but we got there because we didn't make any money in refining. So that\u2019s not the way we want to get there. But when we look at our assets around the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast, we think those are pretty good assets, and long-term those assets will probably be in our portfolio, because if we think about West Coast and East Coast and U.S, it is not necessarily true, Atlantic Basin is a very challenging place if you well know.","We think Bayway is a great asset and a challenged market. You think around the rest of portfolio, our Humber assets is a great asset that needs especially great need of coke, we did good returns out of that, draw a circle around our European operations, excess of 30% the return on capital employed. So that is a good solid business for us.","If you look at that, 30,000 feet the market that we are in North America and Europe aren't going to be growing market, in fact they're probably declining markets. And so the opportunity to employ capital and make a good return on that is just more difficult. I\u2019d rather move into the higher valued businesses in midstream in chemical and we have been pretty consistent about that. But we are always going to look at our portfolio and optimize the portfolio.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","","Okay, great. And maybe just a quick follow-up on that, the East and West Coast comments that you made, given the fact and I appreciate that you intended it in the kind of tongue-in-cheek way, but when we are in the margin environment we're in today, you made the point that our earnings contribution is not so meaningful, and so I guess my question is on the East and the West Coast where you have assets that are maybe non-core long-term, is it easier to let those assets go in a market that you think will be challenged or does it make you more inclined to hold onto those assets before another, however long it takes until we're back in a margin environment where you can maybe get a higher price for those assets.","Greg C. Garland","","Well, I think in any time we look at an asset and we\u2019re going to let an asset go, if we go to get value for PSX shareholders. It has to be tax efficient in terms of the transaction itself. And we look at these assets East and West Coast, we\u2019ll put in advantaged crudes, so that we think we can make them better and drive more value ultimately and optionality that thing, we look at these assets both east and west, we don\u2019t have to put a lot of money into these assets.","The option value to hold on is not high for us and again they are generating positive cash or generating maybe single-digit returns, but they are adding value to the portfolio overall. So we don\u2019t feel like there it is stressed assets, we just have to move today. So we\u2019ll hold them for some option value. We\u2019ll consider multiple ways to create values with these assets, but in the mean time we\u2019re going to work to make them better.","Timothy G. Taylor","I think the focus, Brad, of getting this to portfolio where less than half of our income is coming from refining really is, the focus is how do we grow midstream and chemicals rather than how do we shrink refining. I think that\u2019s the \u2013 and refining capacity maybe lower in the future than it is right now, but there\u2019s a lot going on in to growing our midstream business more quickly and while competing in the refining sector as well.","Greg C. Garland","","And maybe just one more thing, I mean we see opportunity to improve the base refining. We\u2019ve been out there saying we think there is 200 basis points of improvement mostly [ph] by getting advantage crude, managing our costs, pushing our yield and so we still have room to improve our base refining business.","","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And if I could, that served as a pretty good segue into my second question, which is more on the midstream side. You\u2019ve spoken quite a bit about the organic project swipe that you\u2019re looking at and the significant CapEx outlays over the next few years on the midstream side. And the projects at least to date between large projects like the export facility and smaller projects like the Galena Park pipeline that you recently announced, they tend to leverage off of the existing downstream footprint. Do you think or when do you think we\u2019ll see PSX midstream start looking more at projects that step outside of the downstream footprint and would you be willing to look at developing or even potentially acquiring significant midstream assets that are outside that footprint?","Greg C. Garland","","Well, I think the answer is yes. I think ultimately you have to look at that. One of the things we\u2019re really blessed with is we have a portfolio of great projects that touch the existing assets and infrastructure and those are going to be the best returns. We\u2019ll move on those first. You look around the midstream space today. Things look a little expensive to us as you look at valuations, but we would never say we will never do something in that space, but clearly we look at that opportunity set as a existing portfolio, there is lots to do.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And just one quick follow-up on the midstream side, there was recently a transaction where a large SEACOR basically almost recapitalized an existing midstream company with an asset contribution and so maybe found a way around some of the high valuations of some of the assets that are out there in the market. Have you thought about different structures either using PSX or PSXP to maybe consolidate with one of the existing players or even consolidate the remaining 50% of DCP to kind of jump-start some of the midstream growth asset you\u2019ve guided to over the next few years?","Greg C. Garland","","Yes, I think we look at all those options, but clearly we have a \u2013 the MLP we form today at PSX is small and the organic growth opportunities were large here. So I think it\u2019s a very synergistic relationship, but yes, you can use that vehicle to increase your presence over time. So I think as Greg said, we\u2019re always looking at that opportunity, but we\u2019ve got that forward-looking opportunity there and then we got a huge portfolio from an organic or drop-down perspective as well.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","","Okay, great. That\u2019s all from me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Reed of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Yes. Good morning. Thanks. I guess to follow-up a little bit on the last question line on the clean products, I mean some of your competitors are investing somewhat more aggressively and the ability to get to the distillate side of the barrel and your split is close to 50\/50. But I was wondering within your parameters, the specific ROCE required and obviously a desire not to spend too much money here, is there anything we should expect in terms of further clean product yield increases or more of a maybe favorable switch to distillate versus gasoline given where the obvious margin differences are here today?","Greg C. Garland","","So we look at our portfolio. We\u2019re kind of industry-leading distillate yield today. As we look at the investments that will be required to really move the needle a lot on that it\u2019s a lot of money. And so I don\u2019t think we want to make that kind of investment. We do think and now do have in our plans small changes in operations, optimization and maybe some very small capital projects. We think we can push yields another 1% or so within our existing portfolio without spending a lot of capital and I think that\u2019s our plan at this point.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Okay. And then, could you refresh us the contract you got on the two Jones Act tankers to move crude from the Gulf Coast up to Bayway? Between that and the rail, what is kind of the daily ability to deliver some sort of disadvantaged \u2013 price advantage crude \u2013 discounted crude into Bayway at this point or if you haven\u2019t actually done it, what\u2019s kind of the theoretical daily capacity at this point.","Greg C. Garland","All right, it\u2019s one of the optimization refinery. We pushed up over 100,000 from time to time and it\u2019s a 250,000 barrel a day approximately refinery. So I think it\u2019s really about the logistics and we\u2019ll keep pushing north of that as we look at the opportunity that really is around the value of the crude slates and we optimize that, but the crudes that we\u2019ve got from the Bakken and Eagle Ford are actually a pretty good fit in Bayway. So we\u2019ve got a pretty healthy appetite hence you\u2019ve seen the investment that we got underway at Bayway rail unloading and we certainly have the capability from a marine standpoint to bring a lot of barrels into that facility that way.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","So can you get to the full 250,000 barrel a day or you can always be a little bit dependent on some sort of an imported barrel there?","Greg C. Garland","","Yes, I mean I think we\u2019ll just optimize and if the sources develop then I think you can push that. It\u2019s just a question of what\u2019s the right grade, but I think Bayway very likely will have some component of imports for the foreseeable future.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Well that\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","Greg C. Garland","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Yes. Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I want to ask you a question on Wood River. I believe well your partner is talking about kind of may be potentially increasing the amount of crudes to pass heavy crude capacity into that joint venture. Can you just give us an update where you guys stand with that project or if it\u2019s potential project in the future?","Greg C. Garland","Yes, it\u2019s a potential project and it\u2019s really looking at ways to utilize fully that system. So, I think we\u2019re always interested in those higher returns, debottlenecks that did make sense there and so I think we\u2019re continuing to work definitely in the engineering side to try and find a way to increase the use of those heavy crudes and the advantage that we seek with that.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","So would that be kind of a big ticket project, I mean always it\u2019s a kind of modest sort of amount of capital development?","Greg C. Garland","Yes, it\u2019s not anything at all like the revamp that we went through Wood River runs heavy crudes. This is much more incremental optimization kind of stage show. This is looking at the bottlenecks and thinking about where we can find capacity and ways to handle lights perhaps in the heavy crude.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay. And then I was wondering if you can also kind of give us an idea of how do you think maybe sort of butane blending is affecting for the seasonality of gasoline margins. So obviously as we go into the winter season you increase butane blending, is there I was seeing kind of increased sort of seasonality in the margin because of kind of lower butane prices versus oil prices or is it kind of relatively the same versus last year?","Greg C. Garland","Well, certainly the winter seasons here, so butane blending and the lights going in swells of gasoline pool with that and it is economically attractive to do that now. So yeah, I think you\u2019re back into normal pattern where you will see butane blending being economically driven at this point.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","So nothing different from last year in anyway?","Greg C. Garland","No.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, got it. And then last question from me, on DCP Midstream, I mean given that you guys now have sort of your own MLP, you have your own assets, does it make sense at some point in time to maybe float DCP that you \u2013 you inspect for the float DCP as a separate entity. I mean it looks like overtime, you guys might compete with each other within the industry and I am just trying to figure out whether that\u2019s compatible with DCP\u2019s long-term goals and sort of your long-term goals in the Midstream sector?","Greg C. Garland","Yes, so I mean, we looked at DCP, the premier gas gathering NGL producer in the industry. I mean they\u2019re the largest gas gatherer. They are the largest producer of natural gas liquids. We look this as a [indiscernible] going on 14 years, it\u2019s been a great relationship, we\u2019ve got a great partner respect there, they\u2019re talented people, we like them and we see lots of runway left at DCP. And so we want to continue to have a exposure in DCP into the future.","There is lots of ways that we can create value at DCP and I will just say that those conversations are ongoing between the partners all the time as we\u2019re looking at multiple options and how do we create more value for both SE and PSX.","","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay. And the only thing I am asking is, because you recently had this general partnership of planes go public at a very high evaluation. So obviously DCP is sort of fits that, one of those entities that overtime could be a pure play GP. So I am just trying to understand how you are thinking about, is in the market dynamics and how it effects your \u2013 the process here?","Greg C. Garland","Yes, I think, I mean we are aware of that transaction and so I would say, we are considering multiple avenues for value creation at DCP.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks guys, I appreciate the time.","Greg C. Garland","","You bet.","Greg G. Maxwell","Christine, we need to \u2013 we\u2019ve kind of gone over the hour here. I know that there are people still on the line waiting to ask questions. We are just \u2013 I am certainly available, Rose is available after the call, if you\u2019d like to call in, but I think we need to stop the call right now.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell, Vice President, Investor Relations. Kevin Mitchell, you may begin.","Kevin Mitchell","Thank you, Paulette. Good morning and welcome to the Phillips 66 fourth quarter earnings call. With me this morning are Chairman and CEO, Greg Garland; President, Tim Taylor; EVP and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Maxwell; and EVP, Clayton Reasor.","The presentation material we will be using this morning can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website along with supplemental, financial and operating information.","Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It\u2019s a reminder that we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from today\u2019s comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here on the second page as well as in our filings with the SEC.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg Garland for some opening remarks.","Greg Garland","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us today. We ended 2014 with a strong quarter. Adjusted earnings were $913 million and we generated more than $1 billion of cash. Full year 2014 adjusted earnings were $3.8 billion.","We accomplished a lot this year starting with operating excellence. We spent just over $1 billion in maintenance capital. And from an operating reliability perspective, our businesses ran well. 2014 was our safest year so far. Refining, midstream, and chemicals were all top performers in recordable injury rates. We also made progress in our environmental performance.","The strategy we shared first three years ago remains unchanged. Enhancing returns continues to be a key strategic objective. During 2014, total company adjusted return on capital employed was 14%. Chemicals, and marketing and specialties, both increased returns over 2013 at 27% and 32% respectively. Refining\u2019s adjusted return on capital employed was 12%. We continue to take steps in refining to enhance capital efficiency.","From a portfolio perspective, we sold our interest in the Melaka refinery. We continue to limit growth in capital employed in our refining business. We completed several projects to access advantage crews.","We\u2019ve doubled Eagle Ford and Bakken lease volumes. Around the Ponca City refinery, we\u2019ve built out infrastructure for direct access to Mississippian Lime crude. At Alliance refinery, we modified the crude unit, increasing our ability to run shale crudes from 45,000 to 90,000 barrels a day. In addition, at Sweeny and Lake Charles refineries, we completed upgrades of FCC units improving yields. All these actions were taken to increase the returns of the business with relatively small investments.","We continue to shift our portfolio into higher-valued businesses. In 2014, we\u2019ve made significant advances on our growth plans. We reinvested $2.7 billion on growth projects. In midstream, we made good progress on NGL frac-1 project. It\u2019s now over 50% complete. The picture on the slide is the recent one of the site. We look forward to sharing with you updates as we near completion of this project later this year. We also advanced the LPG export terminal due to start up in 2016. Execution is going well and both of these projects are on schedule and on budget.","Last year, we acquired the Beaumont terminal adding 7 million barrels of storage capacity and 600,000 barrels a day of export capacity to our system. We formed a joint venture with Energy Transfer to move crude oil via pipeline from North Dakota to Illinois and then on to the Gulf Coast in our terminal in Beaumont, Texas. We believe these pipelines will be one of the lowest cost options to transport Bakken crude directly to the Gulf Coast. We also increased our ownership in the Explorer Pipeline to 19.5% adding to our portfolio of MLP qualifying assets.","We continue to grow Phillips 66 Partners. EBITDA increased over 100% versus last year. PSXP has an excellent asset base to grow from with multiple investment opportunities. We dropped assets valued over $1 billion at PSXP in 2014, including the Gold Line System, the Medford Spheres, as well as rail racks at Ferndale and Bayway.","Distributions were up over 50%, and Phillips 66 as a general partner is now on the high RDR splits. In chemical CPChem spent $1.4 billion in growth capital last year, as construction continued that CPChem\u2019s world-scale U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemical project. Starter for this facility is anticipated in mid-2017.","CPChem also completed the \u00a3550 million per year one Hexane plant at Cedar Bayou and added attempt that going furnace at unit 33 at the Sweeney complex. The marketing specialties, we acquired Spectrum, a specialty lubricants business. This was a solid addition to our portfolio as it extended the lubricants value chain in the package business. It also provides for growth platform in international markets. We believe that capital allocation is a key factor in the future success of our company.","During 2014 we distributed $3.8 billion in the form of dividend and share repurchases. We increased the annual dividend rate for the fourth time to $2 per share. And through repurchases and exchange, we reduced the share count by 91 million shares or 14% since August of 2012.","Our financial strength and flexibility allows us to maintain a consistent approach in allocating capital in spite of volatile commodity markets. Excluding working capital impacts, we generated $4.5 billion of cash. We issued $2.5 billion of note, walking and attractively priced 20 year and 30 year debt.","And we ended the year with cash of $5.2 billion and a net debt to capital ratio of 14%. As we look to 2015 we know we have to deal with the challenging commodity price environment. We understand the risk and the opportunity these change has create and believe that we have the right strategy to grow value at our company.","In 2015 we have a $4.6 billion capital plan, 65% of which is dedicated to growing our Midstream businesses. Most of the projects in this plan are in play and are largely anchored by fee based contracts.","You should expect regular updates from us regarding the progress made in expanding our Midstream footprint, growing our chemicals business, while enhancing returns in refining and returning capitals to our shareholders.","So with that I am going to turn the call over to Greig Maxwell to review the quarter results.","Greg Maxwell","This is Greg. Good morning. Starting on Slide 4, fourth quarter adjust earnings were $913 million or $1.63 per share. We had several special items this quarter that impacted earnings in all of our segments, primarily related to the sale of our interest in the Melaka Refinery and impairments. Excluding special items, our adjusted effective income tax rate was 32%. Cash from operations excluding working capital for the quarter was $1.1 billion. From a capital allocation perspective, we reinvested $1.1 billion in the business and we returned over $800 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. For the year, our adjusted return on capital employed was 14%. ","In the next slide, I\u2019ll cover earnings for the full-year compared to 2013 prior to focusing on the results for the quarter. 2014 adjusted earnings were higher than 2013 as lower earnings from refining were more than offset by improvements from our chemicals and our midstream businesses. We had a 4% increase in adjusted earnings while adjusted earnings per share increased over 12%. This reflects the progress that we\u2019ve made in reducing our share count. We ended the year with 546 million shares outstanding, down 44 million shares from year-end 2013. ","Slide six compares fourth quarter adjusted earnings with the third quarter on a segment basis. Overall, adjusted earnings were down $227 million, mainly driven by lower results in refining, partially offset by continued strong earnings in our Marketing and our Specialties segment. I\u2019ll cover each of these segments in more detail as we move forward. ","Starting with Midstream, our NGL business had a good quarter partially offsetting the lower earnings from DCP and transportation. The 2014 adjusted return on capital employed for this segment was 13% and this is based on an average capital employed of $4.2 billion. ","Moving on to the next slide, Midstream\u2019s fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $97 million, down $18 million from the third quarter. Transportation\u2019s earnings for the quarter were $53 million which includes $26 million from our ownership interest in PSXP. The overall decrease of $5 million compared with the prior quarter is primarily due to the write off of a deferred tax asset, partially offset by improved throughput volumes in the fourth quarter. DCP midstream had losses this quarter, largely due to lower liquid prices, with our portion of the loss being $11 million. ","During the quarter, both NGL and WTI prices decreased by about 25%. More than 70% of the volumes of gas they gather and process are under percentage-of-proceeds or POP contracts which expose them to falling commodity prices that we saw during the fourth quarter. ","Our NGL business had higher earnings related to improve margins on seasonal propane and butane storage activities. This was partly offset by higher project development cost.","Moving on to slide nine. In chemicals, the global olefins and polyolefins capacity utilization rate for the quarter was 83% with the Port Arthur ethylene plant restarting in November. Results for SA&S were impacted by lower margins and lower volumes. And the 2014 adjusted return on capital employed for our chemicals segment was 27% based on an average capital employed of $4.5 billion.","As shown on slide 10, fourth quarter adjusted earnings for chemicals were $270 million, down from $299 million. In olefins and polyolefins, the decrease of $11 million is largely due to higher plant and maintenance activities, as the impacts from Port Arthur being down were offset by the partial settlement of business interruption insurance claims.","Fourth quarter domestic ethylene to polyethylene margins were in line with what we saw in the third quarter. Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics had a $19 million decrease due to lower realized margins and volumes from CPChem's Middle East joint ventures.","Moving on to the next slide. Refining had a good quarter despite a challenging market environment. We operate our refineries well and although the fourth quarter was a heavy turnaround period, we had a 95% crude utilization rate as we were able to service the conversion units at our Lake Charles and Sweeny refineries without significantly impacting our crude runs.","During the quarter, we ran 95% advantage crude, in line with the third quarter. The 2014 adjusted return on capital employed for refining was 12% based on an average capital employed of $13.4 billion.","The refining segment had adjusted earnings of $322 million, down $236 million from last quarter. Overall, refining was down due to lower crack spreads and narrower crude differentials. This was partially offset by lower impacts from secondary products resulting from the decrease in crude prices.","Regionally, Atlantic Basin Europe had good margins as distillate crack spreads remained strong. Although gasoline cracks fell about 45%, distillate cracks improved by over 30% during the quarter. We benefited from these movements as our refineries ran well and are configured to produce more distillates.","Market capture for Atlantic Basin Europe region during the fourth quarter was 84%, representing its highest capture rate over the past three years. And although the earnings of the Gulf Coast, Central Corridor and Western Pacific regions were lower compared to the third quarter, market capture for these regions also benefited from a high distillate yield. With the Gulf Coast and Central Corridor each having a market capture above 100%.","Finally, the large swing in other refining as a result of a $93 million of adjusted earnings in the third quarter, compared with a $32 million net loss in the fourth quarter. The loss of this quarter is largely driven by negative timing impacts associated with crude purchases.","Let\u2019s move on to the next slide on market capture. Our worldwide realized margin was $9.30 per barrel compared to $10.89 last quarter with our market capture improving from 73% to 89%. The market capture improved mainly as a result of our high distillate yield configuration coupled with stronger distillate cracks as well as improved secondary product margins. Partly offsetting these benefits was less feedstock advantage as crude differentials narrowed significantly this quarter. A regional view of our market capture is available in the appendix.","Moving on to Marketing and Specialties, M&S had another great quarter that continued to benefit from strong margins. The 2014 adjusted return on capital employed for M&S was 32%, and this is based on an average capital employed of $2.7 billion.","Moving on to Slide 15, adjusted earnings for M&S in the fourth quarter were $324 million, a $65 million increase. In marketing, both the third and fourth quarters were great quarters backed by strong margins. The improvement over the third quarter is mainly due to the reinstatement of biodiesel blending tax credits for 2014. Also, during the fourth quarter, we exported 143,000 barrels per day of clean products, representing an increase of 14,000 barrels per day from the prior quarter. Specialties earnings were $68 million, an increase of $25 million increase from the third quarter. This increase is mainly due to improved lubricant and base oil margins.","Moving on to Corporate and Other, this segment had after-tax cost of $100 million, compared with $91 million last quarter. The increase was largely due to higher interest expense associated with the debt we issued during the quarter.","Next, I\u2019ll talk about our capital structure. During the fourth quarter, we issued $2.5 billion of notes. We ended 2014 with a debt-to-cap ratio of 28%. And after taking into consideration, our ending cash balance of $5.2 billion, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 14%.","Next, we\u2019ll cover cash flow for the fourth quarter and also for the year. Starting on the left, excluding working capital, cash from operations was $1.1 billion. Working capital changes were a negative impact of $200 million, largely due to a reduction in payables driven by lower crude prices.","As mentioned earlier, we issued $2.5 billion of notes and we had proceeds from asset dispositions of almost $600 million, mainly from the sale of our interest in the Melaka Refinery. We funded $1.1 billion of capital expenditures in investments and we made distributions of $800 million in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5.2 billion. This is up $2.1 billion from the prior period. ","Switching now to a full year view on cash flow, during 2014, we generated over $7 billion of cash from operations, debt issuances, and non-core asset sales. From a capital allocation perspective, 50% of the proceeds were directed towards reinvesting in the company and 50% for shareholder distributions.","This concludes my discussion of the financial and operational results. I\u2019ll now cover a few outlook items. Starting with full-year guidance for 2015, in refining, we expect pre-tax turnaround cost to be $625 million to $675 million. Corporate and other expenses for the year will be $425 million to $450 million after tax. And our total DD&A will be in the $1.1 billion range.","Moving now to the first quarter, in chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the high 80\u2019s. In refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to also be in the high 80\u2019s as pre-tax turnaround expense will be approximately $170 million. Both chemicals and refining are expecting high turnaround activity in the first quarter and this is reflected in the respected utilization rates. In corporate and other, we expect this segment\u2019s after-tax cost to run about a $110 million for the first quarter. And company-wide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30\u2019s.","With that, we\u2019ll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio","Hi, good morning guys.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Evan Calio","My first question is on refining and I was wondering if you could discuss the developing and steeping contango and how that may benefit Phillips, especially given the structural way in which the crude markets are being forced to balance with the U.S. as a new [indiscernible] and I have a follow up.","Greg Garland","Yeah, Evan, I look at it from our commercial standpoint it creates some opportunities around that. So it\u2019s one of the things that have opened up opportunities with that. I think longer term it just speaks to still a lot of expected recovery and with the inventory building it seems like that\u2019s going to be something that kind of keeps the market in a bit of a [indiscernible], with this much contango I think we still look for a fairly, I\u2019d say fluent and soft market for crude going forward.","Evan Calio","Great, makes sense. My second question is on DCP. And given the current results and the commodity price environment and the recent Moody\u2019s downgraded at DCP midstream LLC. I mean do you see any opportunity there to consolidate or may you have to inject any liquidity into DCP, any thoughts or color on what I appreciate in evolving situation?","Greg Garland","Sure. Well so first of all we like DCP, we think it\u2019s a great asset. We continue to think that the NGL value chain is going to be a very attractive chain to us. This venture is going on 15 years. We value with the partnership, with spectrum that we have here. And by the way, this isn\u2019t the first we\u2019ve seen commodity prices go down in this business.","So, we aware of these crisis before if you want to call it that. I think that if you start with just self help, first of all the DCP team is doing a great job. They\u2019re focusing on running the asset safely and reliably and that builds value by doing that. I think [indiscernible] and his team are doing a great job in terms of pulling in levers they can pull.","Aggressive cost reduction, aggressive reductions in capital. In 2014, DCP level were circling around $1.6 billion, we probably had $800 million out of that in 2015. So, significant reductions in capital spending. The owners have agreed to forego distributions coming out of DCP in this low commodity price environment.","That said, if NGL stay at $0.55, that probably doesn\u2019t fix DCP for 2015. And the owners are, I would say we\u2019ve had on going and we\u2019re still talking about restructuring options for DCP, but clearly important asset is one that we\u2019ll get fixed and it will weather the storm. ","Evan Calio","Okay, I appreciate that.","Greg Garland","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead.","Jeff Dietert","Good morning.","Greg Garland","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Dietert","The global market is oversupplied by some thing like 1 million to 2 million barrels a day depended on whose forecast you look at over the first half of the year and we\u2019ve seen some weakness in brand in some of the West African crudes that I assume are being offered attractively into Bayway and even into the U.S. Gulf Coast. I was hoping you could talk a little about what you are seeing there? Are you seeing escalating competition among your suppliers? Do you expect further deterioration in the Atlantic Basin crude market or as floating storage starting to stabilize it?","Tim Taylor","Jeff, it\u2019s Tim. I think fundamentally we\u2019re looking at the options now on the East Coast to what\u2019s the right value, so we\u2019re still bringing in inland crudes by rail but it clearly the advantage is narrowed. So I look the East Coast will think that\u2019s a logical place that you start to see perhaps some adjustment with the values that sit there. And as far as the Gulf Coast probably not quite as much incentive there with all of the inland crude showing up there, but I think fundamentally this increased supply in terms of import options will put pressure on the inland U.S. crudes and that\u2019s why we would expected this on the U.S. piece to come back out from where they\u2019ve been.","So I think that\u2019s more of the fundamental, but you are right that they had oversupply but yet it still work its way through the system. On the storage piece with the forward markets, there's a lot of incentive on that and so that\u2019s occurring but at some point that becomes something it\u2019s got to be corrected, so that\u2019s why the inventory overhangs still portends some weakness I think on the flat price.","Greg Garland","I think given the forward curve, our view though is storage continues to fill out to it full. And I guess the other complicating issue that\u2019s always hard to get your arms around is - how much refinery maintenance is really going to happen but it looks like we\u2019re heading into a fairly heavy spring refinery turnaround season, which is going to put its own pressures on prices and debts.","Jeff Dietert","Secondly, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about chemical margins for CPChem. They\u2019ve got a large component of having exposure and internationally I think simplistically the market set more on nap the crackers which net prices is softened with crude and yet you had a pretty strong fourth quarter. I was hoping you could comment on first quarter or current outlook and what you see happening in 2015, why is we won\u2019t be able to track it and appreciate those changes?","Greg Garland","Yeah, Jeff, when you look at the fourth quarter clearly feedstock prices continue to fall faster than product price. So you got to look both the demand side as well as the feedstock cost. I think product prices are likely to respond a bit more as we go forward, but still fairly good operating rates and pretty good demand in the chemical business particularly in the U.S. So pretty strong market here, but we would expect that as you go forward that the feedstock got derivative price with narrow somewhat, but still expect the pretty good year in chemicals from a historical perspective.","In terms of the cost curve, it\u2019s actually simplistically, yes, the gap between ethane is narrowed, but fundamentally because of the total chain margin ethane is still very preferred for us in the U.S. as we maximize the value of the cracking slates. So I think that has a longer term impact which helps to bring those margins in.","But again we look at the demand side and still see a lot of upside with that in the U.S. And then if you look at the - what could happen in the U.S. - the world economy with lower crude price as we think that\u2019s a good boost for demand on the chemical side as well. So I think there is a lot of demand side support with that so again we are still expecting pretty good year on chemicals.","Jeff Dietert","Thank you for your comments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning everybody.","Greg Garland","Yes, good morning, just checking.","Doug Leggate","I wonder if I could have two quick ones please. First of all, just away from the operational business, just for a second, I am just looking at the chart you have on your net debt range which not decide towards about 30% but the day as you - you did recently you are sitting about 28%. Is there any withdrawal from not in terms of how you deal with buybacks particularly given where your share prices and just overall capital allocation, does that there is any constraints on you or is this some needs to expect to manage through not too much concerned.","Greg Maxwell","No, I don\u2019t think you put constraints on to all. I think that we did delever coming out of the gate by $2 billion and we did that with great capacity, we saw an opportunity to the lock in some long term debt is what we think is very attractive prices and so we took it. We also have some nodes coming due in 2015 and I think about $800 million. So we are look at that when that comes but we are committed to our 40, 60 distribution capital allocation policy that we laid out a year ago or two years ago.","We\u2019ve got a big capital program in front of us in 2015 mostly imply project that we are going I think it\u2019s going to have a lot of value to our midstream business. So we are going to execute that. At the same time continue with the pretty aggressive distribution program to shareholders.","Doug Leggate","Okay, thanks for that, may be just back to the operations for a second and on my follow up. So obviously we capture a pretty strong. I want to pick in a follow up on Evan\u2019s question. How much of recapture rate outlook or I guess the fourth quarter, but also the outlook is transitory as a result of the bottom of the barrel lag if you like, but more importantly, on the contango issue, that was something that you think would have a meaningful durable benefit to you or something which is more transitory? I\u2019m trying to get a measure of how big of an appetite you guys have to really try and exploit that contango if it\u2019s material or if it\u2019s something that is incremental, I\u2019ll leave it there? Thanks.","Greg Garland","Well on the secondary products, I mean, clearly as the crude price falls, the losses on the secondary products that those product prices don\u2019t move. So we got quite a bit more value uplift, so to speak, on the secondary products and that was a big factor in the capture rate improvement. So that\u2019s kind of that dynamic that worked, so just lower feedstock prices helped that typically. On the contango, I look at it really as it\u2019s going to be part of our normal course of business, we\u2019re not changing where we go in terms of our commercial activity, it does create more opportunity for that and I look at it more in that line, but we\u2019re not fundamentally shifting our business model to work off that contango.","Doug Leggate","Got it. Thanks fellas.","Greg Garland","You bet, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays, please go ahead.","Paul Cheng","Hey guys, good morning.","Greg Garland ","Hey, Paul, good morning.","Paul Cheng","I have several hopefully quick questions. On page 25 of your presentation, when you're looking at the Gulf Coast capture rate, the last bar, just call it other around 3.60, what are the major drivers behind?","Greg Maxwell ","Yeah, we\u2019re trying to catch up with you here. On the Gulf Coast, right?","Paul Cheng","That\u2019s correct, page 25.","Greg Maxwell","It is really product differential was the biggest piece of that.","Greg Garland","Yeah.","Paul Cheng","That\u2019s the product differentials?","Greg Garland","Yeah, the distillate gasoline crack and then - that really drove that and it\u2019s widening based on our opportunities that we had in the fourth quarter.","Paul Cheng","I thought that\u2019s being captured in the configuration, is it?","Clayton Reasor","No, so that actually Paul, It\u2019s Clayton, it\u2019s the difference between the marker and our actual product netback, so to the extent that we get a higher price for gasoline or distillate compared to the Gulf Coast marker. So it would reflect, if we move product out of the Gulf Coast into Florida for example or other locations or export it, that gain is captured in that bar. Yeah.","Paul Cheng","Okay, and then so I presume that the wholesale and [indiscernible] all into that part?","Greg Garland","That\u2019s right.","Greg Maxwell","Any kind of value added that we get above that market price.","Greg Garland","Now that does not include the uplift in marketing.","Greg Maxwell","No.","Greg Garland","Okay. So the - let\u2019s say the wholesale margin between the wholesale to rack differential is really captured in the marketing segment not captured there.","Paul Cheng","Okay, but up to - the rack is captured in here.","Greg Garland","That\u2019s correct.","Paul Cheng","Okay. And, Tim, it is for you. I think that there is a couple of companies that now trying to directly bring all your full pipeline into the [indiscernible] you guys are having one proposal and I think that just went through the open season. Can you give us an update on how is the response and whether that you actually think that will be moving ahead?","Tim Taylor","Yeah, so the DAPL, ETCOP line from the Bakken to the Gulf Coast, that piece is going forward. The terms aren\u2019t disclosed successful on projects moving forward. So in terms of construction, engineering, and still looking at the end of 2016 and we are currently in a kind of an extensionalized system from Beaumont terminal east into Louisiana, and so that process is ongoing. And so it\u2019s really too early to comment, but we think that projects still got some good potential as well.","Paul Cheng","Tim, what kind of timeline - that I know that it\u2019s still early day from the -- brining into the vision, we\u2019re talking about a - may be more clear whether the project going forward or not in another year or again what kind of timeline we may be looking?","Tim Taylor","In the east down piece of that [Indiscernible]\u2026","Paul Cheng","That\u2019s correct.","Greg Garland","Yeah, I think we\u2019ll have the opportunity to have that decision on investment this year.","Paul Cheng","Okay, that early?","Greg Garland","Yeah.","Paul Cheng","And that 2.11 on the NGL MLP-able asset that you guys talking about $1 billion EBITDA, and can you just tell us that what is the percentage of that expected $1 billion EBITDA has been under long-term single [ph] pay and fixed by contracts? The last question is that, I think some of your peers that has came out, including one just this morning that with a new -- maybe more transparent pace and higher pace of asset drop down to their MPL and also with a quite direct part of the EBITDA on their MPL. Wondering that, is that something you guys currently reveal and maybe coming up with a new [indiscernible] also?","Tim Taylor","I think, we said in the past of the MLP-able EBITDA in our midstream segment both today and what we are building is roughly 80% fee-based, if you look at that in its entirety. And as far as drops, we dropped a $1 billion of assets in 2014. We increased the distribution by 50%. I think, as you think about 2015, we\u2019re going to remain aggressive in terms of how we utilize the MLP really to help fund the growth of our midstream program.","Tim, if you want to add anything on there?","Tim Taylor","Yeah. Sure, Paul. I think that on the contract question the supply side and the frac were in good shape. We got the uptick in the terminal. We have not disclosed the percentages. But we made the comment that the implied capital that these are large independent contract, so we feel very good about the success of that track one in the LPG terminal. So that\u2019s kind of in line with Greg\u2019s comment on the fee-based, the commercial piece is coming together on that pretty nicely.","Paul Cheng","Alright. Thank you.","Tim Taylor","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward Westlake","Yes, good morning and I\u2019ll see us in some good downstream results from in fact this morning. I wanted to come back to Doug\u2019s line of questioning on the 28% gearing. Obviously you\u2019ve said that you\u2019re going to try and help DCP and obviously you got a heavy capital investment program and then obviously you\u2019ve said you want to be committed to as a shareholder distribution. If for some reason you know that say midstream and chemicals is tougher this year and feel free to disagree with that statements and maybe cash flow is a bit short. How would you square the circle? What is the priority list?","Greg Garland","I would start with 14% net debt to capital. We got $5.2 billion on the cash on the balance sheet. I mean, we thought about this, we plan for this moment, Ed, and so we positioned the company to successfully execute its plans in 2015 and 2016. So I don\u2019t think that we are concerned about it. Our view is that chemicals business is going to be pretty good in 2015 and that will continue to be self funding in 2015.","DCP is going to be under some stress and we are talking about what potential solutions we can do for DCP with the partners. So I am just - I am not really concerned about 2015 in cash. We\u2019ve already said we are going to operate 2020 to 30% debt to cap ratio. We are certainly in line with that. We will protect and defend our investment grade rating at PSX that\u2019s important to us as we\u2019ve said many times in the past.","Edward Westlake","Okay. And then that was my second question around demands. I mean obviously everyone focuses on ethylene prices which sort of get linked to oil. You guys made polyethylene which has lagged the decline in oil, but people expect it to fall. But maybe give us some of the rationale why you think chemicals will still be good in 2015 with the oil price having fallen?","Greg Garland","Well, first of all, let me talk about - let me backed up and kind of finished your first question. One important piece I missed was around distributions to shareholders and so we have been out there consistently saying and expect double digit increases in dividend, that's so good. 40 - 60 capital allocation, we talk a lot about. We remain committed to that. You moved the chemical business, I think people were discounting the impact of $50 crude globally, in terms of economic activity, demand for petrochemical products. In fact we are seeing increased demand for even refined products.","And so I think the demands are the equations priorly a little better than what people were thinking in terms of 2015. And so we are seeing fairly robust demand in the U.S for petchems. European kind of moving sideways, Asia had weakened in the fourth quarter, but looks like maybe coming back to us. And so I think that fundamentally demand it\u2019s going to be good for petrochemical products, and there is not a lot of new capacity coming on at 2015. So we\u2019re seeing globally marginally higher operating rates, which directionally should be positive for margins.","Edward Westlake","Yeah.","Greg Garland","And we do expect some narrowing on that. It\u2019s just really hard to call, because you\u2019ve got this offsetting effect on demand side. So I think that is why we still say, we look at a exceptional year on the margin side with ethylene based cracking in the U.S and it\u2019s probably just going to soften off of that somewhat. So really hard to call how much, but it\u2019s unlikely would fall in unison with the change in the naphtha price.","Edward Westlake","Maybe what I was trying to get at. Just on the one small question then on Slide 8 - sorry Slide 8 of your recent presentation you have this $2.3 billion Midstream in refining logistics EBITDA for 2018. That was excluding DCP, so I was just wondering, as we think maybe of a tougher environment how much of that would you put in these sort of at-risk category, if any? ","Greg Maxwell","I think as we step back we look at the crude oil pipe in the Bakken, we look at the LPG terminal, we look at track one, those are in quiet, we\u2019ve got some smaller things, under payment good contract. So that is over a $1 billion right there in terms of incremental EBITDA. And so I would say that it probably pushes out perhaps some of that infrastructure, we still like that target, in terms of the EBITDA. But we have - that is a tremendous cooler stuff in play that we have plus, what is left at PSX.","So I guess, we looked at 2.3 and say the 2017 or is it pushed out a bit and I think moving parts currently with the change in the U.S. liquids growth, I think we just want the market clarity around those projects. And so I think we are going to close some of that, but a big chunk of that still step that we committed to and underpinned with good contracts and frankly good fundamentals. ","Edward Westlake","Thanks guys, thanks a lot.","Greg Maxwell","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Wheel. Please go ahead. ","Blake Fernandez","Hi, guys good morning. Question for you continuing on the Midstream theme, it\u2019s obviously you\u2019ve got an awful lot of drop down opportunity and organic opportunities there, but it seems like with the collapse in crude prices some of the EMP companies may have some assets coming to market that could be available, just curious if you could talk about M&A opportunities, is that something that would be of interest or do you have your hands full with the organic opportunities there?","Greg Garland","No, I think we have a great currency with PSXP and I think with the right opportunity we might be interested in that. Our focus today remains on executing into organic projects and so we will just, I think we will see how the market unfolds here in 2015, but I don\u2019t disagree with the idea that there could be some distressed assets out there in 2015.","Blake Fernandez","Okay, thanks Greg. The second question now that, I guess we focus along on light suite and it seems like heavy shower spreads are coming back into favor. I\u2019m looking at slide 34 of your slide back here, but I\u2019m just curious is there any flexibility that you can kind of provide to us as a percentage of maybe shifting the crudes slight away from light suite back to heavy processing?","Greg Garland","Yeah, I think we\u2019ve looked at it and we\u2019ve really - if you think about our configuration globally we are about 65% light, 35% heavy. We typically optimize a heavy around heavy so it\u2019s a lot harder to make that optimization, takes a lot of dip so we still focus on the light piece in terms of where we\u2019ve been getting capability and I think we would believe that that light opportunity is going to be reemerge a little bit more strongly as the year develops as we see, we would expect this on U.S crudes to come back out reflect more dip.","So there's a not just a tremendous amount of flexibility, you can always do some adjustments, but it\u2019s really kind of fixed around that and then we just optimize around that kit.","Blake Fernandez","Got it. Thank you.","Greg Garland","[Indiscernible] optimize a run more heavy as a percentage of quarter. [indiscernible].","Blake Fernandez","Okay, thank you guys, appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey","Hi guys.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Paul Sankey","I just had a question on the dollar, how does the strong dollar effect you guys, if at all, thanks.","Greg Garland","Certainly, Paul we look at that from a different - where our functional currencies are in everything and the dollar strengthening as far as looking at it from a global perspective or our international has a slight impact, but not - I wouldn\u2019t say it was an overall significant impact on us.","Greg Maxwell","Paul, probably the one business where we would see that would be kind of exports on petrochemicals and the competition for export markets, a lower dollar would increase to contingency of Asian manufacturer. So there can be some effect from the dollar just in terms of exports more in those materials markets, but not so much I don\u2019t believe in the fuels.","Paul Sankey","Yeah. I guess basically because you sell in dollars right so?","Greg Garland","Right.","Greg Maxwell","Right.","Paul Sankey","So something around to the internal point of view of the function of currency it kind of doesn\u2019t make any difference to your numbers, is just a question of whether the market is weaker, as a whole right?","Greg Garland","[indiscernible] affect the operating cost.","Paul Sankey","Yeah. did you, just forgive me if I missed, did you talk about your exports levels and stuff I am sure if you gave that number, but just I want the usual question on how much was exported in the quarter regards the petroleum products? Thanks.","Greg Garland","So we were up slightly from the third quarter to around the 400,000 barrels a day. We were down from last year. And frankly, just reflected the fact that we had better options for placements in the U.S. it was not really a lack of access or opportunity, it was more, our optimization around where is the best product placement for those products.","Paul Sankey","Yeah, [indiscernible] it\u2019s interesting. So there\u2019s no sort of notional limitation on your ability to export it just a market function? ","Greg Garland","Yeah","Paul Sankey","Would that be I means it seems a bit pretty roughly on the Chicago market, would that be selling into the Mid Con or into the East Coast as opposed to exposing? What is the better opportunity that you referred to?","Greg Garland","So, [indiscernible] I think about the Gulf Coast from an export platform is our primary vehicle, some of the West Coast as well, but really it\u2019s the Gulf Coast and we just had better so to say inland placement opportunities in the U.S. when we had for exports. So we just always try to add the best value and we just optimized around the highest netback.","Paul Sankey","Yeah. I\u2019ve got it.","Greg Garland","Okay.","Paul Sankey","Okay, thanks guys. I think most of the other stuffs has been answered. Thank you.","Greg Garland","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresham from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Gresham","Hey, good morning.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Phil Gresham","A couple of quick ones, one is just on CPChem, is there any possibilities that the both partners would agree on a less conservative balance sheet strategy at this stage or and I know it\u2019s self funding but is that - something like completely off the table?","Greg Garland","I think we have capacity at CPChem has a pristine balance sheet. And I think, may be - we can certainly go to that.","Phil Gresham","Okay. And then just on the buyback plan for this year. You talked about coming into the double digit increase in the dividend, just given the balance sheet positioning off and potential negative free cash flow. So that would you consider being a bit more conservative on the amount of buybacks that you do this year kind of relative to the run rate we saw on the second half noting that obviously you had some asset sales that helped in the fourth quarter and things like that.","Tim Taylor","Yeah. So we always hesitate to get too far out in front, but I mean as long as we are trading below in terms of value, we're going to buy shares and share price is low where we are going to buy more, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent about that.","Phil Gresham","Okay, last one would just be in terms of the feedstocks that you used in the chemicals business, I think you have a fair amount of flexibility. Is that something you are looking at, does that cost any money to make that kind of switch and do you see any kind of meaningful contribution from doing something like that?","Tim Taylor","On the chemical side, they look at that almost daily and then - things that changes but you got to consider not only the feedstock cost which I think about the marginal contribution in the products that you get. So for CPChem for instance lot of ethylene consumption internally and so that factors into the total contribution.","So it\u2019s really an optimization around which feedstock, and then which products and what the pricing and right now there are still - it\u2019s still favors ethylene because of agile to ethylene versus say a propane but that\u2019s something that\u2019s being watched and when that begins to change you can see that switch in the petrochemical industry. So a lot of flexibility there, but it is still hanging pretty tight in the industry basis to ethane right now - that\u2019s an U.S. perspective.","Greg Garland","The other thing I would say I mean Sweeny team [ph] is heavily levered to LPG fees and we imply would not make the investments to modify facilities to crack more liquids mostly in line with our view the LPG is going to be advantaged over the long-term.","Phil Gresham","Sure, absolutely. Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta","Good morning guys.","Tim Taylor","Good morning.","Neil Mehta","So one part of the business you may not began for credit for here is the wholesale business in wholesale segment, especially if you look at wholesale and retail comps what based on over the last couple of months - and the value increase they have seen. Would you ever consider monetizing wholesale in MLP or spin off and then if so wherewith logical place be in-house with players PSX are an independent vehicle.","Tim Taylor","Yeah, when I look at the wholesale it\u2019s a business that\u2019s typically very solid, so we are - that\u2019s something we\u2019ve not putting into our thinking perceive we have all the other projects on that. But it is something we could consider so MLP four of that would be an option and so it\u2019s something we\u2019ll continue look at, but it is not really the focus point at this point. But I think as that gets clear and when we see how the opportunity and the market accepts that kind of move then that could be a option for us.","Neil Mehta","Thanks, Tim. And then on Slide 23 you show some sensitivities here to WTI, NGL and then changes in the chain margins. Is there any back over the envelope we could do if you aggregate the three components together, let\u2019s say every $5 change in brand or every $5 change in crude does this to our net income?","Greg Garland","I think\u2026","Greg Maxwell","Well, this thing is up really built that way. This is Greg. We hold the other commodity prices constants when we apply those sensitivity. So you really can\u2019t add those up and come up with an overall sensitivity to a movement in net price or brent-WTI.","Greg Garland","Yeah, we haven\u2019t waited there.","Greg Maxwell","We have not. Yeah. So it may overstate the impact of the commodity price movement has on our net income, if you just took the approach of adding all those things up.","Neil Mehta","Fair enough. And last question is related to global demand to pick on your point where you said there that you expect a sequential pick up here in 2015 versus 2014. Is that pick-up that you anticipate - where do you expect it regionally? And then specifically in the U.S. as you think about the outlook for diesel demand versus the outlook for gasoline demand, which of those two end markets do you see greater opportunity for growth in 2015?","Greg Garland","I think on the distillate in U.S. just keeps going if industrial activity, so with - I think that\u2019s been consistent. I think the surprise upside will be the gasoline piece and what is the consumer response to lower prices are driving, we are seeing early signs that demand has picked up. And so we anticipate with lower prices that you should see some favorable demand impact particularly with the gasoline. I would look at distillate to be a bit more of stable in terms of where it has been versus the gasoline. I think that\u2019s where the real variable would be for us.","Neil Mehta","On crude dist?","Greg Garland","On crude dist?","Neil Mehta","Yeah. What do you see on crude dist?","Greg Garland","So the crude dist, again we think the crude dist on the U.S. crude should widen, the brent-WTI should widen back out to something reflecting more of the differential. Cushing inventories are building inventories are building really in the U.S. That\u2019s going to put pressure on that and when people look at the import option. So I don\u2019t think that the inter-crude competition so to speak has yet played out. So we expect that to widen which also could have a favorable impact on the business.","Neil Mehta","Tim, would you be willing to put a point of estimate in terms of brent-WTI, where do you think [indiscernible]?","Greg Garland","I\u2019m going to let him do that because he\u2019s always wrong.","Greg Maxwell","Certainly been tight. I think it\u2019s been harder than we had expect, but I think if you look at that, we\u2019ve always said something around $6 to $10 in WTI-brent, that\u2019s probably too large I think.","Neil Mehta","For 15?","Greg Maxwell","Yeah, for $15 with where flat prices are. So there is still something that\u2019s got several dollars a barrel advantage $4 to $5 on [indiscernible] it seems makes sense with some discount we would think around LLS as well.","Neil Mehta","Perfect, thanks guys.","Greg Maxwell","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read","Thanks good morning.","Greg Garland","Good morning, Roger.","Roger Read","Guess, we could come back to the Midstream in the DCP issues there. I know there is no way that you\u2019d have to make a commitment at this point. We all know well what\u2019s going on in terms of the credit ratings in that business. Yes you were to find yourself in a situation where you needed to do funding of that? What are the mechanics around that sort of the partnership? What would you need both sides to agree is it enough for one side to agree just sort of trying to understand how that could progress?","Greg Garland","I think you got the governments documents, it takes unanimous consent of the partners taking action around the structure, financial structure of the company.","Roger Read","And that would be yourselves and Spectra correct?","Greg Garland","Spectra, that\u2019s correct.","Roger Read","Okay. And is there any sort of a quit call or anything in that agreement?","Greg Garland","There is a [indiscernible] in terms of an exit by one of the parties, but there is no quit call in the agreement.","Roger Read","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on a - I guess just sort of a look back in the fourth quarter here taking a look at slide 25 and some of these questions were asked before. But the weakness in the secondary products and I understand how you were saying earlier compares to an index. But little surprised typically on following crude environment that secondary products actually gets an uplift not a downdraft as we think about realized margins, particularly sometime out on the Gulf Coast here, but then in your marketing and specialties business you talked in the specialties, you know the lub and the base oils actually did get a nice uplift as we\u2019d expect, I just wonder what the cross currents where in that area and maybe that\u2019s something that reverses as we go into first part of \u201915?","Greg Maxwell","So, I think taken the secondary products first. As the crude price falls, the other products prices can move, they don\u2019t move in unison with crude, so the crude price falls, so if they sell less than crude price then your gap between what you realize in net back and the cost so to speak of the feedstock is down.","So it\u2019s not, if the prices here, like LPG prices fell, but not by the same absolute amounts that you actually get an uplift say on that \u201csome of the same things.\u201d So it\u2019s kind of more of the reflection of the feedstock cost moving faster than the product price move and so you have less of a loss on the secondary products. Then, the second product question.","Roger Read","Well, I just - my question is the secondary products appear to be a loss if I am reading this correctly.","Greg Garland","They are, when compared to the third quarter was less of a loss, so it\u2019s about $6 in the third quarter and this is about $4 yeah.","Roger Read","So it\u2019s not really a change it\u2019s what the actual realizations are on those kind of products?","Greg Garland","Correct.","Roger Read","All right, so it was more profitable on the fourth quarter on the secondary products, good. Got it.","Greg Garland","Yeah, better margin.","Roger Read","And then the base oils in the loops business that I guess a similar dynamic at work there?","Greg Garland","Yeah, I mean I think you\u2019ve got feedstock fast falling faster than the market prices and the finished products and base oil product margins are really set off to a supply demand on that. So, it\u2019s a very similar story to a lot of our business. So, we benefited from really that fall off versus a unison fall in the product price.","Roger Read","Okay, that\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","Greg Garland","Thanks.","Operator","And our next comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brad Heffern","Good morning everyone.","Greg Garland","Good morning.","Brad Heffern","Just looking at the Western Pacific segment of the refining business, obviously Melaka is not going to be in the portfolio anymore starting in 2015 and I suspect that that probably had worse margins than the other refineries that are in that segment. Is any color you can give as to maybe what that segment would like historically without that in the portfolio or maybe how you expect margins to change going forward?","Greg Garland","Yeah, I will say that first of all we worked on the denominator, so we have less capital employ and by selling it our EBITDA actually improves in the West Coast. ","Brad Heffern","We can probably get to a better answer than that. Greg\u2019s working on that.","Greg Garland","If we normalized out and just basically strip all the impact to Melaka our West Coast performance would have been just slightly less than a $300 million loss in the fourth quarter, sorry.","Brad Heffern","Okay, got it. That\u2019s perfect, thanks. And then just thinking about you all having a lot of major projects under construction on the Gulf Coast. Is there any chance that sort of the big drop in crude oil here is going to make the labor market a little looser and maybe help you hit those cost targets?","Greg Garland","Yeah, I think directionally it is helpful to us. Some projects are getting pushed or cancelled and that should free up availability. I would say at this point we are more than half way through on track one and we haven\u2019t seen the inflationary pressures that we thought we might see on those projects, particularly quickly around the Freeport\/Sweeney area, where there is a lot of work going on. To begin to have some work going on, we have work others in that area have work going on Dell, Freeport et cetera. So I would say that we are executing well in that environment and directionally it should be helpful in terms of: a) schedule; and b) cost. ","Brad Heffern","Great, thank you. ","Greg Garland","You bet.","Operator","And I will now turn the call back over to Kevin Mitchell for closing comments. ","Kevin Mitchell","Okay, thank you very much for participating in the call this morning. We do appreciate your interest. You will be able to find the transcript of the call posted on our web site shortly. And if you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact me or Rosy. Thanks again. ","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."]}}
