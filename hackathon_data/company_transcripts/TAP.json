Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.","Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time-to-time by the company's executives in discussing the company's performance, please visit the company's website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results that the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors.","Mark R. Hunter","Thank you, and hello and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call. And many thanks for taking the time to join us today. With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have Gavin Hattersley, our CFO; Stewart Glendinning, our Canada CEO; Simon Cox, our CEO for European business; Kandy Anand, our International CEO; Sam Walker, our Chief Legal and People Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, VP of Investor Relations; and we also have Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors, joining us today.","Now as you know, a few months ago, we announced Tom's plan to retire at the end of June, and I'd like to take this opportunity to both recognize Tom's contribution since joining the U.S.A. business and in particular, his leadership since being appointed as MillerCoors CEO around 4 years ago. So many thanks for your leadership and we wish you well, albeit you still have a full agenda through to the end of June.","Now while we are well into the search, we do not anticipate that we will have Tom's successor in place by the end of next month. As a result, the MillerCoors board has asked their own, Gavin Hattersley, to step in on an interim basis to lead the MillerCoors team while we complete the search for Tom's replacement. Gavin is an outstanding and trusted leader with ideal qualifications for the role. His extensive beer industry knowledge and experience in the U.S. and on the global stage, along with his unique experience of having held top leadership positions with both parent companies and MillerCoors, and this makes him the right choice to take the business forward with integrity and a strong sense of purpose. Equally important, Gavin is not leaving MillerCoors, as he will continue in his CFO role here as well.","So with that, let's talk about our quarterly performance. Our results for the first quarter reflect continued volume pressure in our largest markets and, as expected, a significant impact from foreign currency movements, a higher tax rate and terminations of business contracts, all of which we discussed on our last earnings call. Now despite this backdrop, we remain absolutely resolute in our focus on building our brand strength, achieving positive pricing, transforming our portfolio to the Above Premium segment, improving commercial execution and embedding Profit After Capital Charge throughout our organization.","Our first quarter performance headwinds are as follows: our net sales per hectoliter increased 1.8% in constant currency, driven by strong global pricing and revenue management initiatives. Constant currency net sales decreased 3% due to lower volume in Europe and Canada, and by adding an additional effect of foreign currency, reported net sales declined 14.2%. We grew Coors Light volume 0.6% globally, driven by double-digit growth outside of the U.S. and Canada. Our global strategic trust portfolio grew volume mid-single-digit rate in the quarter.","Worldwide volume declined 3.5%, driven by Europe, Canada and the U.S. Underlying pretax income on a constant currency basis increased 0.6%, driven by positive net pricing, along with results of cost-saving initiatives. The underlying performance of the business was stronger than this result indicates, as we cycled a particularly strong quarter last year when pretax income nearly doubled.","Including the effect of unfavorable currency, underlying pretax earnings declined 4.2% on a reported basis. Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $228.6 million, a 9% decrease from a year ago partially due to foreign currency movements. Underlying after-tax income decreased 15.8%, with nearly all of this driven by unfavorable foreign currency and a higher tax rate that was cycling a large discrete tax benefit a year ago. Our board approved a double-digit percentage increase in our quarterly dividend and a new stock repurchase program in the first quarter. And we began to implement this new buyback program with $50 million of cash used early in the second quarter for Class B common stock repurchases.","We also completed the Mount Shivalik Breweries acquisition last month in India. This bolt-on acquisition gives us strong leadership positions in 3 states in India, 1 of the fastest-growing beer markets in the world. It also adds a strong regional fundable brands to our portfolio and gives us a platform to expand our international brands in these states.","Now in terms of regional highlights, U.S. underlying earnings increased 5% due to higher pricing, positive sales mix and strong cost control. Volume was lower in the weak first quarter for the U.S. beer industry. We continue to grow our largest Above Premium brands while also making strides towards restoring growth to our Premium Light brands. Coors Light declined, but improved its trend versus last year. Miller Lite, again, its grew share of the Premium Light segment and Coors Banquet continue to grow volume and share. In Above Premium, Blue Moon grew at mid-single-digit rate in the quarter, while Leinenkugel increased at high single-digit rates, and both Redd's and Smith & Forge Cider achieved strong double-digit growth.","In Canada, underlying earnings declined 12.5%, driven almost entirely by unfavorable foreign currency and the impact of terminating our Modelo joint venture a year ago. Canada sales-to-retail or STRs declined 3.7%, with nearly 1\/3 of this decline due to the loss of the Modelo brands. In Coors brands, the Coors Light sales trend improved versus last year, benefiting from more retail programming and new advertising. The combined Coors brand family grew Canada market share, partially due to the addition of Coors Altitude. In Above Premium, Coors Banquet delivered strong volume and share growth in the first quarter, as did Mad Jack Apple Lager, Molson Canadian Cider, and we delivered mid single-digit growth from our Creemore and Granville Island Craft brands.","Our Europe business faced weak consumer demand in some of our higher revenue and profit markets, and an industry mix, volume mix shift to the Economy segment, and we deliberately chose to pursue value ahead of volume. Our first quarter result reflect positive pricing in most of our Europe markets, also lower volume and negative sales mix. These factors, along with the loss of the Modelo brands in the U.K. in 2015 contributed to lower volume and market share in Europe in the first quarter. Nonetheless, we maintained our focus on building our core brands and Above Premium portfolio, including Crafts, as well as revenue management and price discipline across the region. The Craft and Above Premium brands performed well, with Coors Light, Doom Bar and Staropramen outside of the Czech Republic growing strongly.","Our International business delivered double-digit growth in volume in the first quarter with continued momentum from Coors Light in Latin America and strong double digit volume growth in India. Due to unfavorable foreign currency movements and increased marketing investments, our loss for the quarter increased by $2.4 million.","Now I'll turn over to Gavin to give additional first quarter financial highlights and perspective on the rest of 2015. Gavin?","Gavin D. Hattersley","Thanks, Mark, and hello, everybody. Underlying free cash flow for the first quarter of 2015 totaled a cash use of $162.2 million. This represented $97.6 million more cash used versus a year ago and was driven by lower net income and a decreased benefit from working capital timing, including higher cash paid for taxes. Our underlying free cash flow result in the first quarter excludes a $227.1 million discretionary contributions to our U.K. pension plan earlier this year. Net free cash used in the first quarter of the year is normal in this seasonal business, but this is the lowest and cash generating part of the year. Our first quarter free cash flow included the following factors: $202.6 million of negative operating cash flow and $221.6 million of net add-backs for the discretionary pension contribution minus the cash impact of special items. Invested cash outflows included $73.7 million of capital spending. Our underlying free cash flow included $310.4 million of cash distributions and $417.9 million of cash invested in MillerCoors.","The detailed reconciliation of our first quarter underlying free cash flow is available in our earnings release distributed this morning.","Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $3.251 billion and cash and cash equivalents totaled $317.6 million resulting in net debt of $2.934 billion, which is $521.4 million lower than a year ago. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results for the quarter.","Looking forward to the balance of 2015, we are lowering our full year outlook for capital spending to approximately $300 million, down from $330 million provided on our last earnings call. This improvement is driven primarily by continued weakness of various currencies versus the U.S. dollar, coupled with value engineering of some planned capital projects after running them through our PACC model. All other full year forward guidance is unchanged from last quarter, such that our annual target for underlying free cash flow is $550 million, plus or minus 10%, at April 30th's foreign currency rates. We expect cash contributions to either fund benefit plans to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million in 2015, including our 42% of MillerCoors' contributions. We anticipate 2015 pension expense of approximately $27 million. We expect our 2015 MG&A expense and Corporate to be approximately $110 million. Our consolidated net interest expense to be approximately $120 million, which is based on FX rates and hedging positions at the end of the first quarter and our 2015 underlying effective tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 22%. After this year, we expect our underlying tax rate to be near the low end of our long-term range of 20% to 24% for the next few years, assuming no further changes in tax loss, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions.","In 2015 cost outlook, we continue to expect MillerCoors's cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase in the low single-digit rate for the full year and International business cost of goods sold to decrease in the low double-digit range per hectoliter. In local currency, we still expect Canada cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase in the mid-single-digit rate and Europe to decrease in the mid-single-digit rate. And finally, regarding the profit and cash headwind from foreign currency that we expect this year, we would apply foreign exchange rates at the end of April to our results for the last 3 quarters of 2014. It would reduce our underlying pretax earnings for that period by more than $50 million, and the impact on cash would be even larger. If we add the $5.1 million of FX impacting the first quarter this year as set out in our earnings release, our full year FX estimated impact will be more than $55 million or approximately 6-point -- 6% to 7% on consolidated results. We have taken steps in recent years to mitigate some of our foreign currency exposures by our debt structures and hedging.","So at this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap-up and Q&A. Mark?","Mark R. Hunter","Thanks, Gavin. As we discussed in our last earnings call, we continue to expect our 2015 results to be challenged by negative foreign currency, determination of 3 major business contracts and a higher effective tax rate. Additionally, our Canada results will be affected by new framework agreement that was announced by the Ontario government last month, although we expect much of the impact to be phased in over the next 4 years. We will continue to work with the government and our fellow beer store owners to implement the recommended changes.","Despite these challenges, we will continue to drive our strategy of building a stronger brand portfolio, strengthening our core brand positions and increasing our share in Above Premium, Craft and Cider. We will have a relentless focus in delighting our consumers and our customers to ensure we are the first choice brewer in the geographies and segments where we choose to play and we will selectively build our international brands and strengthen our world-class commercial capability. We'll do this while ensuring we have a fit-for-purpose cost base and a deeply embedded discipline and PACC-led capital allocation process.","Besides including PACC performance measures in our long-term incentive plan this year, we have been rolling out interactive training with each of the country teams to embed our value-driving PACC model from top to bottom in the organization.","Regionally, in the U.S., we intend to lead the beer industry with innovations like Redd's and Smith & Forge Cider, with the latest expansions being Redd's Green Apple and Wicked Mango, and we'll introduce drinkers to new styles and flavors in our Craft portfolio with offerings like Blue Moon White IPA and Leinenkugel's Grapefruit Shandy. We'll continue to bolster Miller Lite with a new national advertising campaign and we'll complete the total refresh of Coors Light that will expand across all consumer touch points that has started with new packaging that emphasizes as born in the Rockies heritage. The brand also dedicates new and national television advertising in March, designed to emphasize Coors Light's unique refreshment and we'll launch additional new television advertising in June.","Last month, we also reintroduced the Summer line extension, Coors Light Citrus Radler with a new name and packaging. And finally, we'll continue to build first choice customer partnerships. Working with our distributors to bring more resources to the on-premise with our building with beer retail strategy, which leverages the higher velocity and the broad appeal of our American light lagers.","In Canada, we continue to invest in our core brands and Above Premium, including Craft, imports and flavored malt beverages. In early March, Molson Canadian introduced the next chapter of its Beer Fridge campaign, and in April, launched an NHL promotion nationally. We also introduced a new advertising campaign behind Coors Light in early March.","In Above Premium, consumer demand remains strong for Coors Banquet, Molson Canadian Cider and Mad Jack Apple Lager, which will be rolled out nationally in the second quarter after a successful launch in Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec in 2014. The national launch of Coors Altitude is proceeding well, as is our expanded partnership for the marketing and distribution at the Heineken, Dos Equis, Sol, and Strongbow brands. We're also launching Rickard's Radler as a new seasonal offering for summer.","In Europe, although some of our largest markets continue to be weak this year, our segment-leading core brands will receive incremental investments in local currency in the remainder of 2015. We also intend to continue the strong momentum of our Above Premium Craft and Cider portfolio, including expanding Carling British Cider to more European markets, introducing new Sharp's brands into the U.K. and adding the Modelo brands to our International Premium brand portfolio in Central Europe this year.","We're also taking important steps in the first half of this year to ensure that our U.K. supply chain is fit-for-purpose, including entering into an agreement in January to sell our Burton Malting operations in the third quarter. And in March, purchasing the brewing and kegging operation of Thomas Hardy's Burtonwood brewery in the north of England, which will give us greater capability and flexibility to grow our U.K. Craft business further.","Meanwhile, following the termination of our U.K. contract brewing arrangement with Heineken at the end of April, we're closing our Alton brewery this month in order to ensure that our supply chain capacity is aligned with the needs of the business. Our International business will focus on growth and expansion in new and existing markets. We'll continue to drive strong momentum on Coors Light and Coors 1873 in Latin America, along with growth in our India business. Our recent India acquisition is in line with our strategy to grow our regional brand portfolio and adds 2 breweries in 2 large Indian states and more than doubles our brewing capacity there. This acquisition gives us a powerful combination of industry-leading brewing expertise, brand reach and operational efficiency that will allow us to grow our brands even further in India, one of the fastest-growing beer markets globally.","Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the second quarter. In the U.S., through April 25, STRs decreased to a low single-digit rates. In Canada, through April 30, STRs were down low double digits. Excluding the Miller brands last year, our Canada STRs were down high single digits in part due to year over shift in the timing of Easter. In Europe, through April 30, sales volume is down mid-single-digits, partially driven by the loss of the Modelo brands in the U.K. this year and the timing of Easter. Our international sales volume including royalty volume increased at double-digit rate in April. Now as always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.","To summarize our discussion today, Molson Coors results for the first quarter reflect a number of headwinds, but we remain resolute in our focus on building brand strength, achieving positive pricing, transforming our portfolio to the Above Premium segment, improving our commercial execution and embedding profit after capital charge in our organization and delivering total returns to our shareholders.","Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. And also, at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website. Additionally, in the next 2 months, we hope to see many of you at 3 events. Firstly, Gavin will present at the Goldman Sachs Global Staple Summit in New York on Tuesday May 12. Secondly, we'll hold our Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Wednesday June 3, at our brewery in Montr\u00e9al. And thirdly, we'll host our annual New York Investor and Analyst Day at the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon of Wednesday, June 17.","So at this point, if we could open up the lines for questions, please. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Faucher from JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to talk a little bit about the COGS guidance here and if we look at the impact of transactional FX, it seems like it should be a negative in both Europe as well as Canada. So can you talk a little bit about the differential there in COGS guidance, given the much tougher COGS environment you're seeing in Canada versus Europe?","Mark R. Hunter","John, thanks for the question. I'll let Gavin pick that up.","Gavin D. Hattersley","John, thanks. Look, I mean, the guidance we gave is in local currency. So the one that's directly in U.S. dollars is MCR. So from a Canada point of view, we've obviously got a lot of moving parts in Canada. We've got the growth in the import brands, which would be Coors Banquet, Heineken and FEMSA, and we've also got a lot of really nice innovation going on there, plus there's the changes of the termination of the Corona contract. And in Europe, we've got brand mix going on there with no Corona, well, that's coming out and we've got the lowest contract brewing volume as well. And from an MCR point of view, it's mostly geographic and PACC mix changes between the vast number of territories in which we operate. All of that is offset to a degree by our cost savings programs, which we've got in place.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like the way we should think about this is at least with Canada, it's actually positive mix from higher-priced products that's driving the piece of that as opposed to, let's say, underlying cost increases?","Gavin D. Hattersley","Well, there are underlying cost increases as well in there, John, yes, but growth in import brands...","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Not just that?","Mark R. Hunter","It's not just that, yes.","Operator","Your next question is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, in Europe, you'd mentioned -- there's a mention of a decision not to chase profitable volume or unprofitable volume in the press release. Could you just touch on a little bit the promotional environment? From what I understood, it become much more promotional in the U.K. in the first quarter, so just some more color there, please?","Mark R. Hunter","Bryan, thanks for the question. I'll ask Simon to pick up some of the detail. I mean, just a couple of context points. Firstly, we've started seeing a couple of markets shift into the Economy segment as consumers make choices about where their constrained disposable income is going to be used. So that's just one dynamic that started to emerge and the team are cognizant of and are obviously reacting to. And to your second point, from a promotional perspective, there's no real new news there, I mean, the European market remains competitive. But Simon, do you want to give a little bit more color to specifically what's happening?","Simon Cox","Yes, Mark. I think, you've covered the headlines. Thanks for the question, Bryan. As Mark said, there is some move driven, I think, by the consumers being economically challenged, particularly in some of the markets post the flood. There is some move towards the economy and value segment in some of our markets. We've chosen not to play aggressively in those parts of the market. And to your question on the U.K, this is always fairly volatile in terms of promotion intensity, but Q1 has been, I would say, a little bit more intense on the promotional lines in the -- particularly in the multiple growth channel. And again, we've chosen not to participate in some of those more aggressive deals, so that's really what we're referencing when we made the headline results.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, just one other question on the Alton brewery. Can you quantify at all how much that will contribute or how much savings you might be able to generate this year from that?","Mark R. Hunter","Brian, we haven't gone -- we haven't given a specific number on that yet now.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But fair to think that it will be some sort of positive offset or positive contribution this year?","Mark R. Hunter","Bryan, yes, it will be a positive contribution, but I'd point you back to our guidance that we have of $40 million to $60 million worth of cost savings in this financial year. We obviously have a lot of moving parts, things that move around, so that guidance has remained unchanged.","Operator","Your next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So in the earlier MillerCoors call, we got a little bit color from Tom just in terms of the MillerCoors board's decision on Gavin's appointment as an interim CEO. So maybe, Mark, just kind of share your perspective on the process and the rationale for having Gavin as an interim CEO? And then, just in terms of his responsibility in managing sort of the both roles, how should we think about that and the potential for this becoming more of a permanent position over time? What are some of the things that you're focused on as you make that decision and really finding the permanent replacement?","Mark R. Hunter","Thanks, Judy. I think there was a multiple number of questions in your question there, I'll try and cover them all. I mean, to the most important thing, in terms of the decision around Gavin, it's because Gavin is absolutely the best person for the job and we're delighted that we're able to ask Gavin to step up and he's accepted to do that. I mean, that's some of the easiest part. In terms of the process, I mean, Tom indicated towards the end of last year his intention to retire and we publicly announced that earlier on this year ahead of our distributor convention. We've had a search process in place. And I think, from our Chairman, Pete, Alan Clark and myself, we are absolutely clear that we want to find the best possible leader for the MillerCoors organization, that's what the organization requires and deserves, and we will take our time and be thoughtful. As I'm sure you're aware, these type of searches sometimes take time. We're well into the process, but it's clear that by the end of June, it's unlikely we'll have a new full-time replacement or permanent replacement in place and we're in a privileged position with Gavin, someone who knows both of the shareholders well, has worked for both companies and has actually operated a very senior level within MillerCoors. So he'll hit the ground running. And whether Gavin is there for 1 month, 3 months or 6 months, he'll be leading that business to compete, play to win and win in the U.S. beer business. That's the agreement, and Alan and I are absolutely clear on that. So that's where we are and we'll keep everybody updated as the process develops over the coming weeks and months. Gavin is going to be busy in the meantime, so please try not to distract him.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then, I guess, my second question is maybe just on the business and switching gears to Canada. Just the industry volume looks a little better in the first quarter. I think, it was up a little bit. Obviously, your share performance is still pretty soft there. The April trend, I know there's an Easter impact, seems like that the volume was pretty weak. So just some broad perspective on kind of what are you seeing in terms of the industry perspective and your effort to really put your market share position in a better footing, how much traction are you getting there? Do you think there's more spending that really needs to go to drive that? Just some color there would be helpful.","Mark R. Hunter","Yes. So Judy, I'll ask Stewart to talk in a little bit more detail shortly. Let me just give you kind of a couple of headlines. I mean, Stewart and the team are in the middle of a very significant transformation of our business in Canada in terms of total restructuring of our supply chain, a big cost down program and ensuring that our portfolio is fit for future. From a Canada perspective, in the first quarter, I was personally pleased with the progress Stewart and the team made on pricing. The Coors Light trends improved versus 2014 that we saw strong growth in Coors Banquet and with our Above Premium portfolio, and we've been encouraged by share growth position in both Alberta and Qu\u00e9bec, which are critical markets for us. Headline level, I would say, overall, we're disappointed with our total performance and we'll certainly ensure far more effective and ruthless execution of our plans in the balance of the year. Take it from me, we'll be running even harder and faster in Canada. We've got a great set of plans and it's very much about the quality of execution of those plans for the balance of the year to build on some of the strong points that are emerging in our Canadian business. But Stewart, do you want to just jump a little bit deeper into some of the detail in Canada, as per Judy's question?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Yes, not a lot I can add to it. I mean, Judy, I think that the quarter was a bit better for the beer industry, no question about it. The shift, I think, from Easter from Q2 into Q1 was absolutely a help. If you look at the marketplace, the market trends were not dissimilar to what we saw last quarter in the sense that the West was much stronger than the East. And so part of our underperformance came from geographic mix. Part of it came from cycling the big promotion of Molson Canadian around the Winter Olympics last year and part of it came from just underperformance. On the underperformance side, we've got a very clear view on what's driving that and we're working very aggressively to change those things. Probably, there's also worth mentioning, just looking at the big picture of things, our goal is to grow share and our goal is to grow the profit. And we've been focusing against this strategy of overhauling the portfolio, driving our cost base down and improving our executional capabilities, and I think we've made good progress on all of those, as Mark commented. If you look back at last year, we saw improving share trends for the first 3 quarters of last year and the last 2 quarters have been more challenged. But as I say, I think, we've got a clear line on where the underperformance is coming from and we'll be working to address that.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Financial.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","A couple of questions. One is just a more technical one. In the U.S., when you gave us that April update, is it fair to think that the Easter shift hurt April, so to speak, the way it hurt in Canada?","Mark R. Hunter","I believe that's the case, yes, Mark.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then, you've caught on India for a while now. You have a nice tuck-in there, but when you think about the longer-term opportunity and how you as a company are going to approach that, can you just think -- share with us a little more, Mark, about your thinking on the role of capital, size capital as opposed to these tuck-in and more organic approaches to unlocking that opportunity over a multiyear period?","Mark R. Hunter","Yes, I mean, I'll give you a little bit of context and I'll ask Kandy to talk specifically about the opportunity that we see in India. But I think, I've been pretty clear that as we look at building our international brands, really along the double act of the Coors trademark in Staropramen, we're looking to drive that business principally on a license and export model with exception of a couple of markets where we believe that we can invest really for the medium to long-term, and India fits really nicely there. I think, we did our apprenticeship in India through our initial foray into the country, and we see a very clear path to strong position across these states. And when you think about the population in these states, across the 3 of them, we're talking 150 million to 200 million people. So these are big markets with real long-term potential, so we'll be selective with our international cash investments, as I say, principally on a license and export model, with a small number of markets where we can see long-term growth potential. On India itself, Kandy, do you want to just give a little bit more color to where we are in the marketplace?","Krishnan Anand","Sure. Thanks, Mark. As building on what Mark said, we see India as an attractive, long-term market. It's currently at market size of 23 million to 24 million hectoliters. It's been growing double digits steadily. And yet, per capita consumption of beer is only 2 liters per person per year, which means, in the long-term, we expect this market to continue to grow. Our strategy in India has been taking positions and attractive steps and building our position, the leadership positions within those steps. With that in our first FDR [ph] which has worked out successfully with the recent acquisition, we have -- I believe, you do that in 2 other steps, so we start with leading positions. And our strategy would be to be successful in these states and roll at a steady pace that we can continue to drive that strategy versus the Pan-India strategy. Specifically, within that, we have local brands, so this acquisition gives us a brand called Thunderbolt, which is a very strong brand, and it also gives us a platform to build our global brands on top of these regional brands, and that's broadly speaking our strategy in India.","Mark R. Hunter","I mean, obviously, any investment in any of our international markets goes through our PACC model and we will be very judicial in our use of cash as per the framework that, I think, we've described on a very consistent basis. We're certainly very excited about the medium to long-term potential around the geographical platform we've now given ourselves in India.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","That's great. And on that, Mark, that's good to hear, and I've got confidence in that. We all know the history of Brazil and China, so that's kind of what's driving my questions about India, but PACC and the approach you're taking, I think, is different. One last one is it pertains to Gavin's appointment and just all of us trying to better understand what's going on here? And I proposed on the earlier call that you would have a bias for an internal candidate. By internal, I mean, someone within the larger SABMiller and Molson Coors system as opposed to someone within the broader beer industry. And of course, Gavin's appointment kind of is consistent with that, but is that a fair understanding of how you're approaching this? Is that a fair understanding of who's coming to you, so to speak? Are you seeing much interest from outside of those 2 companies? I'm just trying understand, trying to get a read on where this is ultimately going to go? And then, the second question is, SAB is the majority owner here, but you have some special rights because of the nature of the situation, I think, contractually. So can you just give us a flavor about how that dialogue works with SAB in terms of ultimately choosing the person to be the permanent CEO?","Mark R. Hunter","I mean, to take the second part of your question first, we have a 50-50 governance model within MillerCoors, so the board is constructed with equal directors from both SAB and from Molson Coors. And it's fair to say, I think, Alan Clark and myself are absolutely aligned on what we need to get done in the U.S. business. We both harbor the same ambition to build a winning beer business in the U.S., and we both hold the intent of ensuring that we have a great leader to lead the MillerCoors organization. We are looking broadly for a new leader. I don't want to get into the detail of the process, the process is well underway. And I think people are just going to have to be patient. I mean, asking an executive from one of the shareholders to step in and run one of the businesses is not unusual in any organization, so I don't think we're doing anything unusual in it. I would really encourage people not to read anything beyond the headlines into this. We have an interim requirement. We have an interim solution and the process for a permanent leader continues.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And next question is from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI.","Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Can you remind us what your target date was again in terms of having the International business go to breakeven and whether you think you're still on target with that given current results and the evolving strategy in India?","Mark R. Hunter","Let me pick that up. So what we said was as we moved towards the end of 2016, we expect our International business to be at least a breakeven if not in profit. We still believe that we will deliver that when you put to one side impact of FX that's clearly impacted the business since we made that statement back at the end of 2013. We expect the FX impact relative to our plan at that point in time to affect us by mid to high single-digit, millions of dollars. So when you include that, it will make it challenging to get to breakeven. When you exclude that impact of FX, we're still very confident that we'll get to breakeven, FX excluded.","Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Terrific. And then, not to kind of go back to Canada again, and I don't want to overdo it, but can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment there, pricing and whether SAB's entrance in April looks disruptive?","Mark R. Hunter","Okay. Stewart, would you like to pick that up and...","Stewart F. Glendinning","Yes, happy to address that. So first of all, let me work backwards. I mean, SAB's entry into the market has been in the last 30 days, so nothing I can really comment on there. I think, we've got a terrific portfolio and we're able to -- we'll be able to address all comers. In terms of competition in the marketplace, I mean, it is a competitive beer market, certainly, more and more brewers as the market and the cross base grows, but I don't think that anything has changed in that over the last quarter. Relative to your question around pricing, pricing was, I would say, broadly in line with inflation across the country. The amounts in excess of that I would put down to mix as both the Above Premium import and the Above Premium domestic segments of the market grew. More specifically than that, I would say pricing was weakest in Qu\u00e9bec and strongest between -- strongest in Ontario and the West.","Operator","Your next question is from Ian Shackleton from Nomura.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just going back onto Canada again, perhaps you can just talk a little bit on how the beer framework changes in Ontario, what that actually means? And my view is obviously building a solid morale is probably a good thing. Do you potentially lose some control of that, which may not be such a good thing. Is that a simple view?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Well, I'm not sure, really. That is true only in that beer stores will continue to operate and will continue to be run by our board as it is today and they will continue to exist in a format that provides opportunities for any brewers to get their beer to markets. So in that sense, I don't think anything changes. As you will have read, there are a lot of changes that are coming to Ontario, but there's not a lot I can add to what has already been announced publicly.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And I think, it was mentioned in the call about a 4-year period. I thought 2017 was the important year, but could you just explain why 4 years is important?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Yes. So a couple of things, so maybe mixing 2 things there. On the pricing side, the province has instituted some restrictions on pricing for a period that ends in 2017, but the beer tax, which at the beginning of the process looked like it could all come in 1 year, will be phased in over 4 years.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Right. So that's the 4 years. Yes. Understood.","Stewart F. Glendinning","They bring that in 25% a year.","Mark R. Hunter","And Ian, just to be clear, that 4-year period begins November of this year, so really think about '16, '17, '18 and '19 as the 4-year periods.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And just as a follow-up. I mean, in that Canada price mix, the plus 3.8% is probably the best that we've seen for a very long time, I think, you have talked a little bit about some of the factors, but is that really sustainable? And I just wanted to -- to what extent, the Heineken brands, the extension of the Heineken brand is helping that?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Well, I don't think the Heineken brands have dramatically changed our NSR mix. I mean, we brought other Heineken brands on board, they tend to be much smaller, but just to give you a sense of the split. When you look at that 3.8%, about 2\/3 was driven by net price and the remainder was from mix.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions in queue. Mr. Hunter, do you have any closing remarks?","Mark R. Hunter","I do. Thank you. I'd just like to thank everybody for joining us today and for your interest in Molson Coors Brewing Company.

Thank you, Mark. Hello and welcome everybody. With me on the call this morning are Tracey Joubert, our CFO; the CEOs of our business units; Lee Reichert, our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; and Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller. Today, Tracey and I will take you through our plans to drive long-term total shareholder returns, discussing our first quarter results and outlook and as usual related slides can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Our first quarter was solid, delivering on our commitment to improving top-line performance while also protecting the bottom-line. Even with industry volume pressure North America and the shift of Easter from Q1 to Q2, revenue was up on a constant currency basis, driven by strong and disciplined net sales revenue per hectoliter growth across our business, ongoing portfolio premiumization and improving share trends in our largest market.","While only the first and smallest of our quarters, I am encouraged by the meaningful growth of net sales revenue in the U.S., led by the increasingly strong performance of Miller Lite which held total beer industry share and an improved performance of Coors Light in our largest and most profitable market, as well as strong U.S. retailer placements for our upweighted innovation program.","We also saw continuing strong net sales revenue growth in Europe, our second largest business unit. Across Molson Coors, I am pleased with the continuing acceleration of our portfolio premiumization efforts alongside our intensified innovation program, and the growth in our underlying EBITDA, which, despite higher inflation, grew on a constant currency basis.","Now as you know, our first choice strategy has three major components focused on top-line, bottom-line, and use of cash allowing us to improve our long and short-term shareholder returns. And more is focused on improving top-line growth and we're advancing on multiple fronts. We're realizing strong pricing across brands and regions giving us more fuel to invest for growth.","Our two largest brands improve their volume trends and our largest market, resulting in better STRs for U.S. business. Global priority brand were a key driver of our consolidated net revenue increase, a strong net sales per hectoliter gains more than offset volume, softness. Our above premium mix continued to improve with Peroni, Sol, Henry's Hard Sparkling and Arnold Palmer Spiked growing very rapidly in the U.S. Blue Moon growing rapidly outside of the U.S., a startup rum and continuing its strong growth across Europe.","We continued to win at retail with additional placements flowing through Q1 and more significantly in Q2. And we're advancing in upweighted innovation program from accelerating the development of Clearly Kombucha and the full national launch of Cape Line and Sol Chelada in the U.S. the Coors Slice, Aqua-Relle and Bella Amari in Canada and to Brador in the UK, plus multiple rapid incubation initiatives such as an Archer Gold, Black Column [ph], hard coffee, and Hydra [ph].","And the readiness for launch of more disruptive initiatives such as Truss, our Canada focus cannabis beverage JV. Our use last discipline as demonstrated by more than $200 million of expected cost savings in 2019 and our expectation of another $450 million of cost savings over the period 2020 to 2022. Underlying these commitments are several enterprise productivity and capability driving initiatives, namely World Class Supply Chain 2.0, global business services, which has now scaled over 500 people in Romania, IT consolidation and procurement savings from multiple sources.","All remain on track and include development of our two greenfield breweries in Canada, including our British Columbia brewery, which is on plan to begin brewing in the third quarter. And we're investing wisely. We've reduced our debt by more than $2 billion since closing the MillerCoors transaction. And our Board's intention remains to reinstitute a dividend payout ratio in the range of 20% to 25% of annual trailing underlying EBITDA for the second half of 2019 and ongoing thereafter.","And we're taking advantage of opportunities to invest more binder commercial agenda to drive a revenue performance, while also increasing our commitment to attractive returns on every marketing dollar.","So with that context over to you, Tracy.","Tracey Joubert","Thank you, Mark and hello everybody. I will speak through the quarter on a consolidated and regional basis, mention cost savings and 2019 outlook and finally to our capital allocation plan.","As highlighted in our earnings release, net sales revenues increased 0.6% in constant currency, reflecting strong passing in each business unit and improving mix in Europe. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 3.7% in constant currency.","Our worldwide brand volume decreased 4.7% and financial volume decreased 3.4%. Our global priority brand volume decreased 3.6%. Underlying cost per hectoliter increased 5.3% on a constant currency basis driven by commodity inflation, transportation costs, increased packaging costs associated with our U.S. bottle furnace rebuild and volume deleverage, partially offset by cost savings.","Underlying MG&A decreased 1.5% on a constant currency basis driven by lower G&A. As a result, underlying EBITDA increased 0.2% on a constant currency basis. Underlying free cash flow was a use of $270.1 million, an increase in cash use of $75 million from the prior year's third quarter, primarily due to unfavorable timing of working capital, partially offset by lower cash paid for interest and capital expenditures.","Moving to our business units, in the U.S. net sales revenue increase 0.7% driven by price increases partially offset by 2.7% decline in sales to wholesalers excluding contract volume. Our cost per hectoliter increased 5.9% driven by higher commodity and transportation costs, increased packaging costs associated with our U.S. bottle furnace rebuild and volume deleverage, partially offset by cost savings.","MG&A decreased 4.5% reflecting lower employee related costs and quarterly timing of innovations being partially offset by higher marketing investment behind our premiumized brands. As a result, underlying EBITDA increased 3.4%.","Brand volume sales improved versus last quarter and last year declining 3.8% on a trading day adjusted basis, which is an improvement versus both the fourth quarter and last year. We've a large share of industry and increased share of premiumized for the 18th consecutive quarter according to Nielsen.","Coors Light volume trends improved while holding share of segment. As the Company's top priority, Coors Light continue to progress following its rollout of new creatives late in Q4 with new on-premise contingent partnerships. We posted significant growth in a number of brands within the advanced premium segments, including Henry's Hard Sparkling, Peroni, Sol and on premise brands and we are confident we can scale the segment more rapidly going forward.","In Europe, net sales revenue increased 4.4% on a constant currency basis, driven by price increases and favorable mix, partially offset by 2.3% brand volume decline. COGS per hectoliter increased 3.7% in constant currency driven by commodity inflation.","MG&A increased 9.5% in constant currency, replacing a higher investment on our national champion brands and premiumization initiative. As a result, underlying EBITDA increased 2% in constant currency.","Continued momentum in 2019 was evidenced by top line growth driven by an 8.2% increase in each sale per hectoliter on a constant currency basis, more than offsetting the volume which was impacted by plane decline in our low margin value brands as we increase our focus on our national champion brands, and the vast premium portfolio.","In Canada net sales revenue decreased 3.4% in constant currencies, driven by a 6% decline in brand volume due to soft Canadian industry volume, which we estimate at the time approximately 5%, partially offset by price increases. COGS per hectoliter increased 6.3% in constant currency driven by volume deleverage, increased distribution costs and costs inflation, partially offset by cost savings.","MG&A decreased 1.1% in constant currency driven by timing of employee related expenses, partially offset by higher investment to support the rebranding of our Molson brand and cash related cost. As a result underlying EBITDA decreased 22.4% in constant currency. Volume was impacted by industry weakness, in terms of brands strong growth from Bergenbier and Miller High Life partially offset softness in our core brands.","The quality [ph] of the Molson trademark also improved during the quarter following initiation of the brand re-launch. Also note we estimate cash related start-up cost of CAD10 million to CAD50 million in 2019.","In international, net sales revenue decreased 14.4% on a constant currency basis, driven by 6.7% decline in brand's volume and favorable geographic mix and the shift of local production in Mexico, partially offset by price increases. Cost per hectoliter increased 2% in constant currency driven by geographic mix and inflation. MG&A increased 11.9% in constant currency driven by parsing the $2 million of settlement proceeds related to our Columbia business in the first quarter of last year partially offset by lower marketing investment. As a result underlying EBITDA decreased to $2.7 million.","Brand volume declined as a result of balancing higher passing with lower volume in Mexico. [indiscernible] Q2 and starting of a strong post [indiscernible] results in Puerto Rico and this was partially offset by growth in several of our exclusive markets such as Chile, Paraguay and Honduras.","Current life [ph] volume was down principally because of the ongoing expense on brand equity growth versus promotional volume growth in Mexico partially offset by strong double-digit increase for Miller Life.","Now moving to outlook, our earnings release details our guidance. The EBITDA margin expansion guidance we communicated in June is unchanged. We expect 2019 consolidated underlying cost per hectoliter to increase at a mid-single-digit rate on a constant currency basis.","In terms of cost savings, we continue to expect total of $700 million of savings for the three years ending 2019 and planned and added $450 million for the period 2020 through 2022. We expect procurement and supply chain including brewer optimization to constitute the majority of these new savings with RC and global business divisions also contributing to the $450 million.","We expect these savings to be spread evenly over the period 2020 through 2022. We outlined our internal engagement plans the cost of achieving the savings and offset input inflation. We expect our international business to deliver underlying EBITDA growth of strong double-digit in constant currency for the full year 2019 compared to 2018. We estimate underlying free cash flow of $1.4 billion plus or minus at the end of this year.","Now as we contemplate full year 2019, keep in mind that we recently rescheduled our organized brewing system implementation from Q1 proceed selling season which will impact ECW savings. We expect increased packaging cost associated with our U.S. bottle furnace rebuild and moderate supply and we intend to incrementally support our brand building initiative for the rest of the year.","At this point I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Hunter","Thanks Tracy. Our revenue focus are more as one of the three platforms by which we drive total shareholder returns and this depends upon extraordinary brands, customer excellence and disruptive growth. Looking at our brands, our commitment to energizing our core brands is paying off. As I mentioned in our largest market Coors Light trends improved with a brand's regaining positive segment share momentum and Miller Lite continues taking segment share while also holding share of the total U.S. beer market but also further intensifying our focus on premiumization.","Highlights of the quarter include strong double-digit or even stronger brand volume growth for Arnold Palmer Spiked for Old Henry's Heart Sparkling and Prone in the U.S. and upper single digit growth for Coors Light in the UK all these drive the National rollout products from star requirement and our global brands remain our priority. Miller Genuine Draft, Miller Lite, Coors Light, Coors Banquet, Blue Moon and Staropramen each of the household name in its market and each can become bigger, thanks to multinational reach.","Miller Lite, Staropramen and Blue Moon are great examples. Brand volume of Miller Lite grew strong double-digits in our international business in the quarter. Our premium brand volume grew 15.8% including growth in the Czech Republic. And Blue Moon in Belgium in brand volume grew strong double digits in each of international, Europe and Canada in the quarter.","Continuous development of our customer excellence capability also remains a focus and is evident across our business. We continued to be a leader in category management in the US as evidenced by a first place result overall in most recent annual Advantage Survey and the first place on premise result in the most recent Annual CM Profit Group survey. Retailers trust us, the group size and value of our beer category and we consistently outperform our competition in this area.","In Europe, customers relate us with our leader net promoter score of 60+, in the majority of the countries in which operate. And our UK business was again ranked number 1 by on premise chain accounts. In Canada we continued to help customers drive category growth. For example, a major retailer has seen improving beer category growth in scores for the reset beer shelves, enjoying brewer retailer teams are applying our success to other major chains.","We are also improving our intensity buying innovation and disruptive growth. Our step up innovation approach is demonstrated by the introduction of [indiscernible] and Archer Gold and Sol Chelada in the US, contributing to more than 180,000 expected placements for our new and year-two products in 2019.","In Canada, Coors Slice, Aqua-Relle [indiscernible] and Bella Amari are ruling out and Truss remains on track to be of course mover in Canada in these beverages are planned to be legalized in October this year.","In international, our portfolio is benefitting not only from Miller Lite's brand, but also from continued expansion of Blue Moon, which is now available in 20 international markets. And finally we are delivering new services and revenue streams through upgrading our digital and ecommerce capabilities in Europe and beyond.","Concluding impact in driving shareholder value, we plan to increase cash returns through an increased evident later this year. We remain committed to our investment grade status and a balanced approach to capital allocation and look forward to intensifying our topline revenue opportunities in front of us. We are first choice for consumer and customer agenda.","Thanks for your time and attention. And with that I will turn it back to Mark.","Mark Swartzberg","Yeah. Thank you, Mark. We look forward to meeting with many of you over the course of year. In terms of upcoming events, I want to highlight several; Barclays will be hosting a meeting in Milwaukee with Tracy and Gavin and other members of our leadership team next week.","Later in the month, on May 22, we will hold our Annual Meeting of Stockholders in Montreal followed by Investor Meeting hosted by BMO with Mark and Tracy and our Canada leadership team. And in June, Evercore ISI will be hosting investor meetings in New York with Mark, Tracy and our Global Treasurer Mike Rumley followed by investor meetings in [indiscernible] at Deutsche Conference with Tracy.","So with that, Keith, I think we will go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And this morning's first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Mark Hunter","Hi, Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","Hey. So first, I was just curious about just for the shape of the P&L this quarter, MG&A still down year over year, but I think not as much as people will probably broadly expecting and then you called out a higher marketing expense and premium lights in the quarter. So I was just wondering if it's very keen to your reinvestment philosophy. And whether you think the brand need more support on an absolute dollar basis, rather than just per hectoliter approach you have been taking and all since you step up that might be required as you push harder on the high ends? Thanks.","Mark Hunter","Thanks Lauren. Let me try and take that an enterprise level. So I mean if you look across our MG&A expense, clearly, you saw a step up in Europe and as we intimated even in the prepared remarks, the increase our spend volume Coors Light and Miller Lite and don't forget, we have got a significant decrease in terms of the G&A component of our MG&A following the restructuring work we did through that Q3 and Q4 of last year, particularly in the US.","So we remain very committed to driving the breadth and depth and strength of our portfolio and really ensuring that we have equal focus on progress on the revenue line while we continue to manage our deleverage program. And clearly as we go into 2020 we start of more flexibility as we continue with the paydown of our debt.","So it's very important for us as we come through this year, we see progress on our revenue and encouraged by the fact that our two biggest business units in the first quarter with the US up almost 1% in revenue and Europe up over 4%. I think that's symptomatic of what we're trying to drive across our business.","In terms of the requirement of any step up again, we continue to focus on a couple of things. One is improving the productivity of the dollars that we have within our business and Miller Lite is a great example and where we haven't made dramatic shifts to Miller Lite but because of the quality and consistency of the marketing activity, we've seen just consistent improvements in the trajectory of that brand where it's actually now holding share of the total US beer market.","Clearly as we get more confident and a number of initiatives we will look to fuel growth as synergies and we will keep you tuned to that. But we're not going to make any statement about step up in marketing and speculate on what that might look like, we will do this in a very thoughtful and considered way.","But we are equally focused on the revenue improvement performance in our business as we are continuing deleverage of our business and that's the balance of the executive team are really trying to drive again.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","So I guess just maybe a very more high-level question. The stocks reaction today I think is just kind of reflective of what the results were versus where consensus was. And so I guess what I - and I guess it may also serve explains or suggests that there is a risk to the year. So I guess how did this quarter unfold relative to what your own internal expectations are and is there - what's the risk or the probability of achieving your full year results now versus maybe what they were when you originally gave your guidance in February?","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Bryan. So let me offer a couple of quick comments around that. So I mean we're not going to get in a habit of continually commenting on consensus, but let me make a comment this quarter that look at the consensus in the marketplace. So on a full year basis the consensus looks to be with an acceptable limits, it's kind of in the ballpark, but my perspective is that H1 and Q2 are too optimistic and the second half is too pessimistic.","And some of that to do with phasing and timing in our business the shift of the Albany go live from the first half to the second and continuing focus on building momentum behind our brand portfolio and our revenue growth.","On a full year basis the consensus looks as I say pretty much to be in the ballpark.","Relative to the first quarter, the first quarter came in pretty much in line with our expectations and the guidance that we've given for the year remains unchanged. Now if you look at our track record, Bryan, over the last three or four years. We deliver on the commitments into the marketplace, we've done in cost savings, we've done it in the free cash flow, we've done that on a margin expansion. So we remain committed to the guidance that we should quarter ago and we're off to a solid start this year.","But I do think some of you need to just reflect on the phasing as you look at the buildup of our P&L.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","So I guess I wanted to just get a little bit more colors as on your top line performance in the quarter. In the quarter that more broadly kind of thinking about the balance of the year, on the positive side your price mix realization was strongest. And I think in quarter while so maybe tax, sort of much more price with the mix and how we see that playing out?","And then on the volume side, I mean the FPR I guess got a little bit better sequentially, but down 3.8% seems like its full on the performing the inventories. So how do you think that that - how does that come in relative to your expectation? And I guess when you think about the concusses underway you called out to Bryan's question is that maybe as sort of the expectation that volume does get out of the balance of the year, so perhaps you give us some more color just in terms of your confidence level on that front. Thank you.","Mark Hunter","So Judy, I think three is three or four parts to your questionnaire. So, Gave, if you get ready and I will pass across you in a second. I think, Judy, on your price mix question, as you look across our business, one of the things I've talked to you very consistently over the last 24 to 36 months is we focus on our business on building our pricing and revenue management capability and making sure that we're managing in a very thoughtful way as the balance between price mix and volume.","And we know that in our big developed markets, industry volume is under pressure. It's not new news. And we're really building the muscle around the price and mix element of that. And I think you've seen that demonstrated both in the U.S. and very consistently in our European business with a very strong performance from the European team through the first quarter.","So just take that as a context with of one of the capabilities and focus areas that you'll continue to see us come back to. And we're really driving our teams very hard in terms of our total revenue performance. That's something we've now introduced into our long-term incentive plan as well. So even more focused in our business on a nail tip basis around our revenue performance.","So that's just a little bit of context. Gav, do you want to talk about, really the first quarter and your thoughts on the full year from a U.S. point of view.","Gavin Hattersley","Sure, Mark. Good morning, Judy. So yeah, first quarter pricing was strong. We were pleased with that. Mix, to answer your question specifically was negative 30 basis points that's the best performance that we've had since 2017. And even more pleasing was the pack the brand mix side of it was actually flat which is an illustration of our above premium extorting to come through most of the negativity on mix was related to package.","You know that the full benefits of our mix shift really owning and start taking it in Q2 as lot of our innovation comes through and increased same behind brands like Blue Moon where we're nearly doubling our media spend.","As far as the outlook's concerned, look, it's too early to tell the impact of the springs yet, but I can certainly tell you there haven't been as widespread or as impactful as have been speculated in some of the industry newsletters.","From a volume perspective, Judy, it was a slight improvement over 2018, but it was a substantial improvement over our fourth quarter trend. And Easter timing, obviously didn't help, but move from Q1 into Q3. I mean, it wasn't a meaningful driver, but it wasn't helpful. And a lot of our activities I said, is directed to start in the second quarter our new innovation Cape Line, for example, a strong push behind Peroni, which is - its performances has doubled since - its growth rate has doubled since last year into the strong double digits.","So, yeah, I think that covers it, Mark.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Gavin.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Robert Ottenstein, Evercore ISI.","Eric Serotta","Hi, it's Eric Serotta for Robert. In terms of - wondering whether Mark or Gavin give some commentary on the U.S. pricing environment. If you're saying that mix was negative 30 bps for the quarter it implies roughly 4% pricing before some of the spring industry pricing goes in place. Any additional color you could go on as to what's going on there, because that seems like a tremendous acceleration? And related to that, are you seeing any pre buying from distributors ahead of the spring pricing initiative?","Mark Hunter","Eric, I think Gavin touched on that in his answer to Judy, but, Gavin, any further thoughts or any more color that you would offer or any restatement of what you just said.","Gavin Hattersley","I mean, not much more to add Mark. I mean, we did have strong pricing performance in Q1 and that followed the healthy increases, which we talked about in the fall of last years. So I mean, we already started to see acceleration of pricing in the fourth quarter. As far as the spring price increases are concerned, I wouldn't say there's been much pre-buying or in certainly nothing material to call out, Eric.","Mark Hunter","Yeah. Eric, I mean, the headline that we all read of by in terms of this potential spring, price increase seems to be much more patchy and sporadic than maybe industry commentators had speculated on. So I mean, we are running our own playbook in terms of how we're managing our portfolio and how we're focused on our revenue line. And Q4 demonstrated some good improvement and Q1 has continued that.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets.","Amit Sharma","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Mark Hunter","Good morning,","Amit Sharma","Mark, just a clarification. So should we expect this level of price and perhaps better mix to continue for the rest of the year? I mean, if you think [indiscernible] in the U.S.? And that's one. And the second one is a broader question like, it's very clear that you're talking about revenue management, and you want us to focus on the dollars versus the volume. And I think most investable thing that's desirable and so the companies that have obviously done that successfully.","My question is, like, how do we deal with the volume deleverage in the meantime, right? Is there any way for you to dilute the impact of deleverage or overcome it so that margins don't continue to come down as you lose volume, especially on the economy end?","Mark Hunter","Okay. A couple of questions there. So on price mix, I mean, we just want to give guidance in that area. I think the best thing to do is look at our historical track record, particularly over the course over the last four to six quarters, you've seen very consistent progress, particularly in our European business.","And as Gavin and I intimated, Q4 saw an improving trend, Q1 has continued that. And as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we're really focused on managing the balance across price mix and volume. All three of those are important. So at the end of the day in aggregate, we are focused on driving the revenue performance of our business.","So we're not either overemphasizing any of those three components or giving up in any one of those three components. Clearly, if there is a volume deleverage challenge in our business, then we'll continue to manage your cost base appropriately and effectively. And I think we've demonstrated that on a multiyear basis our ability to do that.","And clearly we're, looking to invest more heavily buying our brand portfolio as well. So I really ensure that, volume remains an important part of that revenue equation. So I think you're - as I mentioned earlier, the focus for the management team is to ensure that we've got improving revenue performance while we continue to manage our P&L and to drive, the deleverage commitments and retain our investment grade status.","And that becomes - as we get into 2020, that balance shifts, probably a bit more finally towards revenue, because we'll have delivered on, very fundamental deleverage commitments through 2017 to 2019. And you're starting to see the repurposed focus on revenue as we come into 2019. And that will be a continuing theme from us as a management team.","Tracey Joubert","And, Mark, if you don't mind if I just add, I mean, some of the things that we spoke to before in terms of margin and cost, the reminder that cost savings Gav answered as well as some of the initiatives like I will start Supply Chain 2.0 which is focused on capability building as well as efficiency in our breweries. And then some of that other ongoing cost savings in our key and our global business services in Bucharest. So cost savings and cost continue to get the strong focus that's most improved has always had. And these are the some of the initiatives that will continue to drive costs down and margin up.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi. Yes, so thank you. Good morning. So can you update us on the brewers systems rollout? And I understand Tracy had a call out the delay Indigo life for Alberni into after the big season. So I was wondering if that there is any impact on that from the other brewers that went live recently. And if you can update us on the most recent category trends in the second quarter outlets? I think you call out that, the second quarter obviously has some downside risk to consensus on. But I'm wondering if it's more an investment, or if it's also top line. Thank you.","Mark Hunter","Okay. So Gavin, do you want to talk more broadly about the BPNS rollout, including, just the progress that unit team have made over the last 12 months and oversee the balance of this year?","Gavin Hattersley","Sure, Mark. Good morning, Andrea. Look, I mean, as you know, we are converting all our legacy breweries to the integrated systems platform and it is going to get our entire network onto a single tool for ordering for claims done in return and so on. And, frankly, whenever you have a systems implementation of this magnitude challenges are expected. The rollout has continued since Golden, we've done Trenton, we've done Fort Worth and we've most recently done Milwaukee.","The last three rollouts have all been meaningfully better than our Golden rollout. It's not to say we haven't had some challenges, because you do with a system rollout of this extent and all the change management that comes with it. But the Milwaukee issues that we've had are very limited to the Milwaukee brewery orbit, and unlike last year with Golden where they were fairly national. And on top of that our stock trends are in a much better place than they were a year ago. We are right back where we historically operate from an out of stock point.","To address your question on Albany specifically, we recently rescheduled the Albany brewery go after the peak selling summer season, because we just wanted to make sure that our products completely available for the summer. Given our learnings from Golden, we decided to exercise an abundance of portion with Albany and that we disrupt the network given the transition. So we're on track Albany will go live in the after summer and Albany all of that will follow soon after that, and we should be done this year.","Mark Hunter","Okay. Thanks Gavin. I think it's fair to say with that shift as well. Clearly what that does is it moves some of the STW phasing in our business from H1 into H2. So that's just something to bear in mind, as you think through the balance of the year.","In terms of the second part of your question, certainly as we come through the second quarter, I think one of the things as I look at some of the consensus numbers, I think COGS is understated relative to our guidance. So I would - I should take a look at that, as you look at the Q3 number in particular.","And clearly, we're ramping up our innovation pipeline as we've come out of Q1 into Q2. So I expect us to be investing as we go into the peak selling season, because we want to continue to drive the momentum from a top-line perspective. None of that undermines in any way, our feel your guidance that we gave you a quarter ago and restated again today.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.","Laurent Grandet","Yes. Good morning, Mark and Tracey.","Mark Hunter","Good morning.","Laurent Grandet","I would like to focus on Canada. Last quarter, you mentioned we're seeing improving commercial trends in Canada, seems like it didn't materialize this quarter. So could you please give us some more color here and how we should think about Canada going forward?","And also as a potential positive catalyst here, could you please update us on your Truss cannabis JV? Would you be ready to launch or test you price, I mean Q4 this year when it becomes legal in Canada for beverages. And what are your expectations as your scale in Canada could be an advantage versus some of your competitors?","Mark Hunter","Okay. So, Fred, you want to pick up the - why don't you take both parts of that question just in terms of our underlying performance in Canada relative industry and then just a preparedness for our Truss launch.","Frederic Landtmeters","Sure. So starting with the volume part of your question. We obviously have soft volumes in our first quarter this year. And despite the fact that the small quarter, I mean, it's a big percentage. Now, the main driver and 80% of that volume softness is explained by industry. And just to be clear, we don't expect the industry to be down 5% for the remainder of the year, like it was in Q1.","Obviously, Easter timing is a big driver of that. But as industry performance comes back to a normal trend, I think what we should focus on is our shared trends and actually that's where we've got stability for the last three, four quarters. We've got a stable share trend, it's not good enough, but we're actively working on further improving it.","So the stability of the trend is driven by our performance in the economy segment where we're continuing to grow share. We've got some significant initiatives in place to continue to improve the trends on our premium brands. And especially in the above premium craft space in the beyond beer space. We've got some big initiatives that have been launched in the past few weeks. And that should help us significantly changing the trends in the quarters going forward.","So those initiatives includes RTDs, but also include Coors Slice in the premium segments. And that's one of those initiatives that should contribute to a meaningful change of trend there. So from a commercial performance, I think the underlying behind the softness of Q1, I think there's still a high level of confidence that we're continuing a good trajectory from a share performance perspective.","The second part of the question on Truss. Absolutely, still on track to be ready on day one of legalization. So as you know, legalization of cannabis infused beverages is expected to happen on the 17th of October 2019. I can confirm what I said last quarter, which is we're going to be ready to be one of the first movers. We're making great progress in terms of product developments. We're making great progress in terms of implementation of the supply chain components. So, yeah, confirming what I said before we're going to be ready.","Mark Hunter","And Fred, just add to that, as we indicated in the script, obviously we are - we have set up our business. We've got a great team of people in place working with the team at HEXO. So clearly there's additional readiness and startup costs through this year. Assuming the timing goes ahead, as indicated by the authorities in Canada, then we'll start to get a little bit of revenue coming through right at the end of this year. And then it becomes part of our overall revenue performance really from 2020 going forward. So again, just bear that in mind as you think about phasing of cost than our business in particular Canadian business through this year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Back.","Steve Powers","Hey, guys, thanks.","Mark Hunter","Hi.","Steve Powers","So as you said, you stand committed to the deleveraging in dividend step up commitments that you set last year which is very validating. But given where you finished the first quarter in terms of net debt and trailing EBITDA and then now, Mark, earlier your second quarter comments. It seems like you've got a good ways to go in order to hit that 3.75 net debt to EBITDA level, if my math is right.","And I know that historically, second quarter has been a really strong cast generation quarter and perhaps more so this year if the working capital headwinds that we saw in the first quarter reverse out. But is that the right way to think about achievement of the deleveraging target by mid-year, or other reasons to believe in stronger EBITDA growth?","Your second quarter comments would seem to rule that out. But I just want to confirm if I'm hearing you, right, relative to the phasing of EBITDA versus cash generation and net debt reduction.","Mark Hunter","Okay, thanks, Steve. Yeah, I mean, the way the Board are looking at this is, where are we going to be at the year-end and are we on our deleverage flight path. The mid-years staging post, but they're looking for us to give confidence around our full year performance. And, we're - we remain very committed both internally and externally to the gains we've given. There is, I think, a little bit more volatility than we have originally anticipated in terms of H1 versus H2, some of that had to do with the shift in Albany.","But Tracy, Do you want to just give a little bit more color around that and some of the phasing differentials, none of which affect our full year commitments?","Tracey Joubert","So thanks Mark and happy, yeah. Our full year end guidance that we've given, remain. And in terms of the shift from H1 to H2, as we mentioned, the Albany shift, obviously, that would have an HTW impact and going from half 1 to half 2 which also impacts our free cash flow. And also, in the stated topic I said increased investment behind innovation and premiumization as we go into two periods that Mark spoke about it.","Looking at free cash flow, the bigger driver in Q1 and is that timing of working capital. Obviously, working capital is a leader that we look at. And we would pull for the back half of the year to replace that timing. And then the other things I would add is our cost savings initiatives and which really impacts both P&L and free cash flow. So, we've spoken about the $205 million of cost saving to achieve this year.","So that will obviously hit the P&L and free cash flow for the balance of the year. And, the final thing I would say is, if you just refer back to our history of hitting out the cash flow targets, the past two years, we've delivered about $3 billion of free cash flow, and we have a record of delivering or over delivering on all of our commitments across both our P&L and our free cash flow.","Steve Powers","Thanks, Tracy.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jeffries.","Kevin Grundy","Hey, good morning everyone.","Mark Hunter","Yeah.","Kevin Grundy","A clean up question from me on Canada, just given the weakness in the quarter with SDRs down 6% I think the comment was 80% was owed to the industry and some of the weakness there and I think Easter timing was called out, but one thing that was not mentioned was cannabis. And I know it's still very early days, but how much work have you done on that what do you think the impact has been so far from it? It's obviously very topical with implications going forward. So any thoughts you have there would be helpful. Thanks.","Mark Hunter","Okay. Thanks a lot. Fred back to you, you want to build on your earlier comments?","Frederic Landtmeters","Yeah. Absolutely so given on that question we're obviously monitoring the situation and the potential correlation of beer sales and cannabis sales since the legalization back in October 2018 and I think at this point in time it's really fair to say we see absolutely no correlation between the sales of cannabis and the sales of beer across the industry or from also in Canada specifically. So we're going to continue to monitor that, but there's no evidence, no data that show us based on the last five months of cannabis sales that show us an impact there.","Mark Hunter","And Kevin, the only thing I would add to that is I mean we're seeing a similar picture in the U.S. where we monitor the states I mean there is - if you look at beer industry volume trends in states where cannabis has been legalized, some states are slightly better some states are slightly worse, there's not been any kind of major discontinuity in underlying beer volume trend. So we're watching in both markets. Can't point to any real connection between cannabis legalization and performance of the beer industry at this stage.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Tristan van Strien with Redburn Partners.","Tristan van Strien","Hi good morning guys. Just I've got a question on Europe, but before I just want to clarify I understand correctly from Gavin. So basically in Q1 you got 4% frontline pricing. I just want to confirm that because that seems to be the best performance since Q3 2009. And in fact I don't see it in any of the IRI or AC Neilson data, so I just want to confirm that number.","And then my question really was to Simon Cox, he seems a bit lonely here. Just also just that performance seems remarkable on price mix if you can just break that down how is that working also in terms of country mix and how the UK is doing? And what have been the drivers behind that very strong performance? Thank you.","Mark Hunter","Yeah. Thanks Tristan. Gavin do you want to pick up firstly on the U.S. pricing question?","Gavin Hattersley","Yes, Tristan, I can confirm that our front line pricing for Q1 was 4% and the negative mix was 30 basis points and native 3 point sale. And I'll just remind you that a lot of things go into the pricing, right, things like the FET tax law, retail operations, festivals top sells all of those things are factoring, but you're correct 4% is our base performance in quite some time.","Mark Hunter","And I think, Gavin, just building on that if you track that through some of the IRR - IRI or Neilson data, clearly our retailers themselves chose to invest in price activities. So what we're realizing in price doesn't necessarily then get reflected in terms of what showing up to the retail data. So just bear that in mind Tristan and as you're trying to connect the two. And then Simon do you want to give a broader picture on how we've been managing the revenue performance in Europe?","Simon Cox","Yeah. Thanks Mark. Thanks, Tristan. So yeah we've consistently tried to ensure that we've got good underlying momentum on our top line growth and we've managed to do that quite consistently now for a good few quarters.","We try and focus on volume price and mix as Mark mentioned earlier these are equally important drivers. And we don't expect that to be the same every quarter, but we do expect across those really for that to grow our top line. And as it manifested in quarter one, we grew our top line by 4.4% and on this quarter that was mostly driven by - was driven by pricing and mix; pricing was up about 4.8% and mix up about 3.4%.","And that's the manifestation of very deliberate focus on insuring national champion brands will invest in across all their markets and that we continue to premiumize the portfolio. And so again we've put our marketing efforts into our mainstream national champion brands and into a premium portfolio. And we believe that continues to work well for us and we think that works and results.","We don't tend to break out country mix. But UK is still our number one revenue and profit business so there's no way that we will be able to post that type of strong top line growth unless the UK were participating in it as well. And again, it's the same structure in the UK. We want to make sure that calling [ph] is well invested.","We have a new campaign for the made local campaign which we're putting significant money behind and is off to a good start. And the UK is fully participating in the premiumization push so again Staropramen doing well, Blue Moon doing well, our craft beer a portfolio seems to be in good shape and our cider portfolio continues to premiumize.","So same strategy in the UK as the rest of the business units. We won't break it out specifically, but a very pleasing quarter when it comes to our overall revenue growth.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Simon. Good summary.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research.","Brett Cooper","Good morning everyone. Just a quick question. I mean, as you think about Molson Coors in three to five years, and you highlighted the soft beer industry, a number of your larger markets, can you your management team, the Board get to where you want to be, by being a brewer only?","Mark Hunter","As opposed to what Brett? I mean, if you look at what we're doing in our business, let me characterize how we're trying to build out our portfolio, I mean our center of gravity is clearly today and will continue to be as a brewer focused on our beer brands and the premiumization and modernization of our beer portfolio. We're then continuing to accelerate the development into what we described as adjacencies whether that's cider or RTD.","Beyond that, we're moving into brewed beverages more broadly and you've seen a number of our initiatives whether that's non-alc businesses, like Clearly Kombucha testing like along hard coffee, but that's an area and a territory, which we believe we can develop further from a revenue perspective. And that also includes our non-alc beers as well. If you look at our law and non-alc business overall, we have well over, I think 1.2 million hectoliters litters of low and non-alc beer and that revenue continued to grow positively through 2018 and has grown positively again in the first quarter of this year.","And then if you go even further, clearly, we're into some new frontier areas in our Truss and our cannabis JV in that area. So we're already developing our portfolio to have more stretch and breadth. And what we talk about in our business is energizing our core brands, our national champions, premiumizing the portfolio, modernizing our offering and then really disrupting.","And those are the four drivers and then alongside that will continue to look for infill M&A opportunities. And I think we've used those kind of opportunities very effectively, the most recent one being, the Aspall Cyder acquisition in the UK. And we remain open to and alert to further opportunities to really broaden our portfolio and generate new sources of revenue. So you will see us do more of that over the course of the next three to five years.","I've avoided trying to get ahead of ourselves on this because I think it's really important that we deliver proof points to you as opposed to just speculate what we're trying to do. And I think those proof points are now starting to emerge in our business and you'll see more focus on that in the coming quarters.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Thank you. I didn't expect to sneak back in. So I just wanted to ask one more question. You have mentioned about flexibility building as you go into 2020. And I - by our math also that does include free cash. So as you think about cash returns and I was just curious to what degree you've even gotten this far with the Board and talking about shareholder returns beyond the dividend increases? Share repurchases seem like something that would be on the table as we move towards that timeframe, or is that that discussion still a bit further out? Thanks.","Mark Hunter","It's probably more of the latter Lauren. I mean, we've been very consistent about our capital allocation framework, which is really focused on continuing to deliver our business, returning cash to shareholders and that can be dividends and\/or share buybacks. And importantly, continuing to strengthen our business and use of cash to pursue other brand-led growth opportunities. So that's the framework that we have used, are using and will continue to use.","Clearly the current commitment and users around our expectation on the dividend going through the second half and beyond. And I think it's premature at the stage to speculate beyond that, but we will be applying that same framework in our ongoing discussions with the finance committee and our board.","Operator","Thank you. And next is a follow-up from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets.","Amit Sharma","Hi, thank you so much for the follow up. Gavin, just wanted to ask you about Blue Moon in the US. You talked about double premium brands but didn't hear much about Blue Moon. Obviously, you were looking to invest a little bit more. Can you talk about where we are in that cycle?","Mark Hunter","Gav, do you want to take that up?","Gavin Hattersley","Sure, yeah. Sorry about that, Amit. Blue Moon is already the number one cross-brewery in United States. That is what people are looking for, which is a great brand. It's great session of a beer. And we're going to be increasing our activation support across the business in what we started towards the back end of Q1, but the real push comes in Q2 and Q3. We've got a goal of becoming the number one tap handle in America. We recently secured a really good win with Red Lobster, which I think is one of the last major on premise athletes not to carry Blue Moon.","This weekend we've got the Kentucky Derby where we the official sponsor, and we're activating that across the country as well, Amit. And we're also going to do activation around the 50th anniversary of the of the Moon Landing, you know, 12 pack bottles and 15 pack cans are a big opportunity for this brand. And we're going to nearly double the media spin behind it. So, you know, a lot of activity behind Blue Moon this year and looking forward to seeing the results.","Operator","Thank you. And that's all the time we have right now for questions. So I would like to return the call to Mark Hunter for any closing comments.","Mark Hunter","Okay, thank you. And thanks everybody for their time and attention. Just a couple of headlines to finish with. Obviously I've offered some perspective around consensus. So hopefully, that's been useful and helpful as you think about Q2 and the full year. And on the back of the first quarter, I'm encouraged by a number of things across the Molson Coors business. And our two biggest business units, we saw both revenue growth and EBITDA growth.","We've seen the strengthening of Miller Lite and improvement in Coors Light. I'm encouraged by the ongoing premiumization progress we're making and there will be more to come on that front. And the innovation initiatives have been very positively received. And you can see us ramping up, know the intensity of our incubate and test initiatives. As we mentioned, we are ready for the launch of cannabis infused non-alc beverages in Canada and our Truss JV is firing on all cylinders, ready for that go live date.","And importantly, we remain fully committed to our full year guidance metrics, albeit as we've mentioned, there's a little bit more phasing volatility than originally planned and I think we've explained why. So that's why I've described the first quarter as a solid start to the year. And we look forward to catching up with many of you at the forthcoming events that Mark outlined.","But in the meantime, really appreciate your time and attention and the quality of the questions and look forward to catching up on a face to face basis. So thank you, everybody.","Operator","Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Before we begin, I will paraphrase the company's Safe Harbor language.","Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results that the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Peter Swinburn, President and CEO of Molson Coors.","Peter S. Swinburn","Thank you, Candice. Hello, and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call. Thank you for joining us today.","With me on the call this morning are Gavin Hattersley, Molson Coors's CFO; Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors; Stewart Glendinning, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors Europe; Kandy Anand, CEO of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors's Chief Legal and People Officer; Zahir Ibrahim, Molson Coors's Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors's VP of Investor Relations.","On the earnings call today, Gavin and I will take you through highlights of our first quarter 2013 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective of the remainder of 2013.","Our first quarter numbers include the effect of the Central Europe acquisition that we completed in the middle of last year. Because of this addition, we recorded volume and sales increases but a posttax income decline. The decline was driven by 3 months in Central Europe debt-servicing costs being allocated against our lowest earnings quarter of the year in that region, along with foreign exchange losses and increased marketing spend across the rest of the business.","As reported by others, weather affected volumes in all of our markets. Against this backdrop, we grew share in Europe, saw relatively flat share in the U.S. and lost share in Canada. Our innovation programs got off to a fast start and reflects a pipeline that is both full and exciting. In the U.S., our portfolio transformation strategy delivered growth in domestic net revenue per hectoliter of 4%, the largest quarterly percentage increase in 4 years.","Also, Nielsen results indicate that we gained share in each key segment in the first quarter, and we achieved initial success with the national brand launches of Redd's Apple Ale and Third Shift Amber Lager. Coors Light grew market share, while Miller Lite declined. Overall, we again achieved market share growth in the Premium Light segment.","In Canada, the substantial excise tax increase in Qu\u00e9bec last November impacted volumes this quarter. Our business was disproportionally affected because of our high market share in Qu\u00e9bec. Late in the quarter, we relaunched the Aluminum Pint bottle and launched Molson Canadian Wheat. In Europe, we grew overall share, driven in particular by the strength of our brands in the U.K., Bulgaria, Croatia and the Czech Republic. Our core plus and premium portfolio performed strongly, with Staropramen, Coors Light, Doom Bar and Cobra all in growth in the first quarter.","Carling, our largest brand in Europe, also grew in the first quarter. The integration of our U.K. and Central Europe businesses is progressing well, and we are on track to deliver the synergies related to the Central Europe acquisition as well as cost reductions associated with the U.K. restructuring.","As a result, pro forma underlying results in Europe improved significantly. In international, we achieved strong volume growth in Latin America and India, and we also introduced Staropramen Unfiltered in Sweden during the quarter.","So with that as an initial overview, I'll turn it over to Gavin to give first quarter financial highlights and a perspective on the balance of 2013. Gavin?","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks, Peter, and hello, everybody. Molson Coors's first quarter underlying aftertax earnings decreased 36% to $54.6 million or $0.30 per share. This decline was driven by the inclusion of operating losses in 3 months of debt service this year from Central Europe acquisition in the lowest sales and profit quarter of the year. Results a year ago did not include these impacts.","This year, negative foreign exchange of $6 million on a pretax basis also contributed to lower results, along with weak economic conditions and challenging weather.  Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors increased more than 20% due to the addition of Central Europe results. As we have in previous quarters, I will provide an overview of our results, with MillerCoors presented as if it were proportionately consolidated. This is a non-GAAP approach, but we believe it provides a useful view of some key performance metrics for our business.","On this basis, total company net sales increased 10.4% in the first quarter, driven by the inclusion of the Central Europe business along with growth in the United States. Despite pricing growth across all markets, net sales on a per hectoliter basis decreased 6.8% in the quarter due to the addition of Central Europe sales and a lower net sales per hectoliter rate.","Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 4.5% due to the addition of Central Europe, which has a lower cost structure than our other businesses, partially offset by higher cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada.","Total company gross margin was 36.4%, 150 basis points lower than a year ago, primarily due to higher cost of sales in Canada, including a higher brand investments captured in this line. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 10.2% due to the addition of Central Europe results and investments for national brand launches by MillerCoors.","Underlying operating margin was 7.3%, down 170 basis points from a year ago, driven by higher Canada cost of goods sold, increased brand investments and the addition of Central Europe MG&A, which were partially offset by positive pricing and cost savings.","Looking specifically at our New York segment on a pro forma basis, which includes the U.K. and Central Europe for this year and last year, this business improved financial performance substantially. Overall market share was higher, pricing increased across the region, and cost savings were achieved. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.","It is important to note that our first quarter underlying results exclude some special and other noncore gains, losses and expenses that net to a $21.9 million pretax charge. These exclusions from our U.S. GAAP results primarily relate to unrealized foreign exchange and fair value adjustments associated with the EUR 500 million convertible notes issued as part of the Central Europe acquisition, along with restructuring charges in Europe and Canada.  These special and other noncore items are described in detail in this morning's earnings release.","Underlying free cash flow for the first quarter of 2013 totaled a use of $49 million. This was a $30 million lower cash use versus a year ago and was driven by a significant improvement in working capital, which was partially offset by higher capital spending, pension contributions and cash income taxes, all of which were anticipated.","Net free cash use in the first quarter of the year is normal in this seasonal business, but this is at the lowest profit- and cash-generating time of the year. Our first quarter 2013 free cash use was made up of the following factors: $180 million of operating cash flow, which includes $117 million for MillerCoors; plus $10 million of net add-backs of Central Europe acquisition-related costs and restructuring payments. Investing cash outflows were $68 million of capital spending and $109 million of cash invested in MillerCoors.","Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $4.65 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $512 million, resulting in net debt of $4.14 billion, approximately $100 million higher than 3 months earlier due to seasonal cash use.","Looking forward to the full year, our full year forward guidance is unchanged from last quarter: underlying free cash flow of $700 million, plus or minus 10%; defined-benefit pension expense and contributions, which are expected to be approximately $50 million of expense and $150 million of cash contributions, including 42% of MillerCoors; capital spending of about $330 million for the year; corporate MG&A expense at approximately $105 million, excluding foreign exchange movements; consolidated net interest expense of approximately $170 million; underlying effective tax rate changes of 16% to 20% for this full year and 20% to 24% on a longer-term basis; and cost of goods sold per hectoliter for each of our businesses, with the U.S. up at a low single-digit rate, Canada up mid-single digits on a local currency basis, Europe up low single digits on a local currency basis and International up low single digits for the full year.","At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for regional outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Peter?","Peter S. Swinburn","Thanks, Gavin. In the U.S., our share performance was improved across key segments, and our net revenue per hectoliter growth is the strongest it's been for 4 years.","For the third straight year, we're increasing our investment in innovation, and we are focusing that innovation on the biggest, highest-potential opportunities and the most profitable parts of the U.S. beer market. We will see new activity behind Coors Light and Miller Lite. And in Craft, we are planning new line extensions for Leinenkugel's and Blue Moon for summer and the fall. In above-premium, we're building on the initial success of launching Redd's, Third Shift and Batch 19 nationally.","In Canada, we look forward to the hockey playoffs in key markets in the weeks ahead, along with full retail activation for the new season this fall. Going forward, we have a strong innovation program following the rollout of Molson Canadian Wheat. This will include the launch of Molson Canadian Cider in select markets this summer and Rickard's Shandy. Along with our innovative Aluminum Pint bottle, we also expect our 2 lead brands in Canada, Coors Light and Molson Canadian, to benefit from further packaging innovation ahead of the summer selling season.","In Europe, Romania, Serbia and Hungary are on a firmer foot than just a few months ago, with trade inventories at better levels and the elimination of some low-margin package configurations. Staropramen is growing strongly across our Central Europe markets, and Carling grew volume and share in the U.K. The innovation agenda across Europe is accelerating, with Carling Cider now in market in the U.K. and performing in line with expectations.","We are also broadening our Carling Zest portfolio with the launch of a ginger variant, and we are extending our beer mix offerings across Central Europe with the introduction of a cider mix and 3 new flavors.","Additionally, we are launching  [indiscernible] Super Dry in Hungary, Carling in Croatia and Molson Canadian in Ireland. Our International business continues to focus on growth and is investing ahead of the curve in high-opportunity emerging markets behind a solid portfolio of Coors Light, Carling and Staropramen.  This business is on course and continued to drive growth in our key brands in the quarter. For the balance of 2013, we will expand into select markets and reduce our investment per hectoliter as we drive our international group to profitability over the medium term.","Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the second quarter: In the U.S., for the 4 weeks ended April 27, STRs were down mid-single digits. In Canada, our sales-to-retail for the first 4 weeks of the quarter decreased at mid-single digits. In Europe, our sales volume increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the first month of the quarter, with growth in all our key markets apart from the Czech Republic, which experienced unseasonably cold weather. And in the first 4 weeks, our international sales volume, including royalty volume, increased at a double-digit rate. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead.","So to summarize our discussion today, our first quarter numbers include the effect of Central Europe acquisition that we completed in the middle of last year, which increased volume and sales but decreased income because of the seasonality of the business. Foreign exchange, brand investment and weather also affected our business. Against this backdrop, we grew share in Europe, saw relatively flat share in the U.S. and lost share in Canada.","Our innovation pipeline is full, and related programs are off to a fast start. In the remainder of 2013, our focus will continue to be on the 3 pillars of our growth strategy, and particularly the first one, which is to grow profitably in our core businesses through brands and innovation. We also intend to pay down debt. In combination with disciplined cash use, our growth strategy is designed to drive long-term profit cash flow and total return for our shareholders.","Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. And also, as usual, at 2 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.","And so at this point, Candice, we'd like to open it up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So in Canada, the pricing increase in the quarter was weaker than we've seen in the last couple of years. Can you just give us some detail on what drove that softness and the competitive environment in general in Canada? And also, your expectations as we look out for the balance of the year?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Sure. Dara, it's Stewart Glendinning here. Well, we won't give any forecast, of course, for the balance of the year related to pricing. But if you look back at this past quarter, yes, 1% was not strong pricing. I will say it was positive, which is good news. There were parts of the country that were more aggressive and competitive than others. Certainly, I think, if we looked at the Atlantic region, we saw a lot of promotions there. And particularly in BC, we saw higher levels of promotional volume in that province. Qu\u00e9bec saw actually strong pricing, which came on top of the back -- on the back of also increased taxes, and the combination of those things affected volume in the province. Ontario was broadly in line with our average.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And do you think some of that promotional environment lingers as we look at the balance of the year, or was it more just kind of tactical within Q1, especially given some of the volume weakness in industry?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Well, it's hard to say what will happen in pricing because it is so dynamic and because we don't give any forecast on that. I will say that beer is, against other markets, relatively expensive in Canada, and it is a very competitive market. So we'll see what takes place over the balance of the year.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then up in Canada, you've been struggling from a market share standpoint the last couple of years here after really having nice outperformance prior to that. So what do you think has been the main issue from a market share standpoint? And some of this packaging innovation and other focus you mentioned in the balance of the year, does that really help you start to close this market share gap or even start to outperform at some point?","Andrew T. Molson","Of course, we are focused on driving the best possible answer for our shareholders, and a big part of that is market share. I think if you look back at the history of what's taken place in -- from a market share perspective, it's been most of the -- gains have come at the -- on the back of gains in wines primarily and also in the smaller brewers, those 2 impacts. Specifically, against the smaller brewers, that pressure has come both on the value end and in domestic above-premium. On the value end, you will have seen a push very hard this year with Keystone into a number of markets, also looking to be very competitive on our existing legacy brands. And I'm pleased to say that in value in this quarter, we saw a gain in share. On the above-premium side, we've been very successful there both in terms of Rickard's, Canadian 67, some of our higher-priced products, along with our craft offerings in Creemore and Granville Island. Again, we have seen those brands growing. But if you look at the shape of our portfolio, we are under-indexed in that above-premium segment and we're under- indexed in value. And so as some of those segments have seen growth, we have lost share. Now if you look at the balance of the year, so what should you expect? First of all, as I mentioned, we are pushing hard in both of the segments we're under-indexed in, and we've seen positive results there. As it relates to the mainstream part of our business, a lot of new innovation coming in the remainder of the year. Molson Canadian Wheat has been released; Cider is going to be in the marketplace; on the above-premium side, Shandy. So there's some news now coming into the market, which I think is going to be helpful for us as we look at the back part of the year.","Operator","And your next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, if I could follow up on Canada a little bit. It's -- there's been some challenges, but we're still talking about growth rates from a volume perspective in the single digit. Can you give some context on the impact of the deleverage, because the down -- the degree to which profit was down was quite high versus what we saw in terms of volume, and especially, the offset that pricing should support?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Sure.","Peter S. Swinburn","[indiscernible] just for clarity, there wasn't growth in Canada. There was growth on NSR. The market was down about 0.8% and we were down about 1.4% in volume terms. So Stewart, do you want to pick it up from there?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Yes, certainly. So thanks for clarifying that point. Of course, negative volumes do drive deleverage. And I think if you'd just reflect on our COGS, Kaumil, COGS were up just under 6%. About 1\/3 of that was related to deleverage in mix, so giving you a sense of the kind of impact that, that can have on the results.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, about 1\/3. And if we were to see -- as we get into the larger quarters, does that 1\/3 shrink substantially if we're talking about the same volume numbers?","Stewart F. Glendinning","We're not going to break that down for the rest of the year. We have given you some guidance on what COGS looks like for the rest of the year, which is up mid-single digits. And obviously, each quarter, we'll report out on, specifically, what drove the quarter.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then on taxes, if -- I know you still have -- you've given us guidance for this year, but as we could think a little bit long term, obviously, your taxes seem to be -- have been structurally quite low to date. Do they stay there? Do they need to -- or will they creep up to a, just closer to a mid-20s as we go forward?","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes, I'll pass you on to Gavin for that in a second. But obviously, just to sort of build a little bit on Stewart's answer. Directionally, you're obviously right, because as the volumes increase, the fixed costs remain exactly where they are. So we would expect that to be a lower figure going forward.","Gavin Hattersley","Yes, on tax, Kaumil, the 16% to 20% for this year is the guidance that we're holding to. I mean, the first quarter, as I said -- as I think we said in our release, we did have a discrete tax item, which drove a benefit in a very low-profit quarter. So we're sticking to the 16% to 20%. And yes, it's going to take us 3 years for us to get to the 20% to 24% level. So we will come off to 16% to 20% in the years ahead.","Operator","And your next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess I wanted to also just follow on Canada. And just kind of stepping back, this is a market where obviously, from a profitability perspective, you've struggled a bit. And I think you're still committed to growing your core markets in a profitable manner. So to the extent that you can talk about some of the things that you can control more on the cost side, what is the sense of urgency to really get some of those cost savings? And can you maybe talk about some of the opportunities, regardless of really what happens on the volume side?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Yes. So thanks for that, Judy. Look, let's start with the urgency. I mean, there's a high sense of urgency in our business generally to ensure that we are as cost-competitive as possible. I think if you looked at our operating margins relative to those of some of our competitive set, you'll conclude that there are some differences. Some of those differences are driven by the structure of our partner brands. But we are pretty clear that when we look at other areas of our cost structure, that they are driven by choices that we're making. And so we are actively looking at what changes can be made there. Sorry, could you just give me the other part of your question?","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I think it's just related to that. I mean, what are some of the things that you can actually -- you've made choices to control? And maybe you can even quantify what you think are the components of your cost structure that you can control, and what are the buckets of those opportunities?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Yes, I mean, I think -- yes, so thank you for that. I think, look at -- broadly speaking, it's going to break down both into COGS and G&A. And you could run some comparisons between us and others and see those gaps. I can't really get into the specific of -- by line item. But broadly, we're focused on the 2 components of G&A and COGS. On the bright side, I mean, I would look at this most recent quarter. And specific to the COGS line item, we fully offset all of the inflationary impacts that we saw in the quarter with ongoing cost savings. So cost savings are an active part of our agenda. And in fact, if you looked at some of our just broad G&A this quarter, it is lower than last year. And that's because we have fewer people. So I don't want to leave you with the impression that nothing's been done. In fact, a number of things have been done. But looking forward, we expect that there's more ground to cover.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a clarification on the pricing. So in Canada, you said it was up 1% per hectoliter. How much of that was mix versus price, pricing? And then, as you're kind of launching some of these higher-cost packaging, are you not just getting enough maybe mix improvement to kind of offset some of that, some of the higher costs because of the competitive environment? Or -- I guess I'm just wondering because it seems like the mix is a more negative on the cost side, but not necessarily flowing through on the positive to the pricing side.","Stewart F. Glendinning","You got it. Well, I mean, look, first of all, on -- just to address mix. When you look at the mix impacts, there's a couple of things going on. There's brand mix. Depending on the brand, that will influence cost, if it's partner brand or not a partner brand. I think if you looked at some of the higher-priced new product we're putting in, of course, our starting point is to try to ensure that we capitalize on higher-priced, more attractive and premium products to increase our margin on those. As it relates to other mix impacts in the market, an important dynamic to just understand is that broadly, across the market, there is a shift between bottles and -- from bottles to cans, cans being a more expensive packaging mix. And those prices are going to be somewhat managed by the market. Depending on where competition goes, we'll need to be competitive. So if I look back, I can see some periods where you'd like to get more margin on the can, but actually the competitive benchmark that's been set is putting some pressure on that. So a mix. So in some cases, you're getting more for that expensive product, and in some cases, not.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then my final question, just on the European segment. I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more color just in terms of the cost savings you're getting, both on the synergy side as well as the savings that you're getting from the restructuring?","Peter S. Swinburn","We'll bring everyone up to speed a bit more at the analyst conference, Judy. But safe to say, as we said in the script, we're absolutely comfortable with where we are in terms of the synergies that we're driving out compared to the business case that we explained to you when we bought the Central European business. And equally, we're getting all of the cost savings that we expected to get from the restructuring in the U.K. as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ian Shackleton with Nomura.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Your performance in Europe looks very good compared with some of the other reporting we've seen. Volume's always minus 1% and then up in April, and a very healthy price mix, 5%. I'd like to have a bit more color, particularly on that price mix, how it's been achieved by market? Is it merely price mix, and how does it vary, as I say, across markets?","Peter S. Swinburn","Mark, do you want to take that?","Mark Hunter","Sure. I mean, what I'm not going to do is delve into every market, for obvious reasons. But if you look across Europe, on a pan-European basis, pricing's up just under about 5% on a local currency basis. And that's split pretty equally between mix and between price, net price improvements. So we're seeing the right kind of channel and pack improvements, and we're getting headline pricing coming through as well. I think on the volume front, overall industry was down just under a couple of points, a couple of percentage points. The interesting thing is that on our last call, I explained that Romania was probably blurring some of the industry performance because there's been pretty significant growth in that market, all driven in the very low-margin value segment. If you actually strip Romania out of the industry numbers, industry is down about 3% or so. And I think that really kind of emphasizes the strong performance we've seen across the majority of our markets. The U.K. is growing strongly. We've seen record shares in Bulgaria. We were #1 in Croatia. We were #1 in the Czech Republic, where we've recorded our highest-ever off-premise share. And the good news is, in both Romania and Hungary, which have been a bit more challenged, we're pretty confident that we've got those markets stabilized, and we're focusing our investment on higher-margin parts of the market. So really trying to work across each market on a market-by-market basis to give that aggregate improvement that you've seen, but I can't really go into any more detail within each of the markets, for obvious reasons.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And just following up -- I mean, overall -- because I thought you gained share in the region. And I'm just thinking about the markets where that's happened, it sounds like Romania, probably, you didn't, because the growth was large-pack PET. Is that the one that you didn't gain share in or...","Mark Hunter","Yes, and to be fair, the major markets we did grow share in. So the U.K., Bulgaria, Croatia and then the Czech Republic. In Serbia, Romania and Hungary, we've been working actively to actually get our stock in market, held by the distributors back to what I call more normal levels. That process is pretty much complete now, and we're feeling much more confident about the relationship between our supply and the demand in the marketplace. But we certainly gave up some share in Hungary and Romania, albeit both of those markets are very challenged from a unit margin perspective.","Operator","And your next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more clarity on how we should expect your debt paydown to proceed this year and whether you have an objective for where your leverage should be at year end?","Gavin Hattersley","From a debt leverage point of view, let me start with that. I mean, over the next 3 years, we've -- our stated objective is to get our leverage levels back to where they were pre-acquisition of StarBev. So depending on which rating agency you ask, we were either in the mid- to the high-tier levels. So that would be our medium-term or 3-year goal to get to that level by 2015. We have 2 debt coming up -- or 2 items of debt coming up in 2013. One is the euro convertible, which was done at the time of the deal. And that can be put on us by CBC anytime between 14 March, which obviously has passed, and the middle of December, but that will settle this year. And then the other one is the $575 million convertible, which is due in July. We have recently, as you would have seen from our financial filings, put in place a commercial paper program, which we were using to fund those 2 debt payoffs, including the cash resources we've got.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivien Azer with Citi.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My first question has to do with Europe. I'm trying to reconcile 2 comments that you made. I heard you say, I think, that you wanted to invest ahead of growth in that region, but at the same time, target a reduction in your investment spend per hectoliter. Can you help me reconcile those 2 comments, please?","Krishnan Anand","Well I think the comment that Peter made in the script -- this is Kandy. That was on the International business. I think what they're doing on International business is investing in high-growth markets and -- but at the same time because our growth in terms of volume is higher than the growth in our investment, we are decreasing our investment per hectoliter. And that's been consistent over the years, and we intend to continue to do that until we can start contributing to profitability in the medium term.","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes, just to build on that. I guess, the 2 comments -- I mean, at the macro level, we are investing ahead of the curve. So we're investing in long-term growth, but at the moment, that's costing us money. So we are investing ahead of the curve as far as the businesses concerned. That investment, as it pays off, means that we grow the business. And as the volume grows, then our costs -- our costs reduce because increased margin is spread across the whole system, if that make sense.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, it definitely does. That's great. In terms of the Canadian market, not to belabor the point, but as I think about some of the industry dynamics and the updated number that you've offered for April, I'm curious if you can kind of tease out what the kind of onetime shock was from a price increase versus a weak consumer versus maybe just volume shifting to other categories as you kind of unpack the components of the overhang on volumes for the industry?","Peter S. Swinburn","There's a couple of things, I think. I mean, first of all, don't forget that for all of our numbers, with possibly the exception of Romania, which has a different calendar, Easter fell in the first quarter this year as opposed to the second quarter. So our second quarter numbers are affected by the comparison against Easter, that's point 1. I wouldn't personally get wrapped around the axle too much on small details of what happens in the first quarter in a relatively small volume and profit period. I think Stewart outlined the structural issues in Canada which we have to deal. And they are that structurally, the growth areas are above-premium and value. And what we're doing about that is that we've done a lot of work on value. We've had a best-value performance for quite a long time and actually grew market share in value, but we under-indexed. We also under-indexed in above-premium. Again, although we've had a good period in above-premium, we under-indexed. Within that, we're trying to keep our core brands moving forward. Canadian had a relatively good period. We've got a lot of innovation coming through. So what really is what we're doing about it, I think Stewart was pushing into, and what we're doing about it is we're going to continue to put pressure on that value segment so that we get closer to our fair share, but also, in above-premium, develop on the brands that we've already got in terms of Creemore, Granville Islands. But also, if you look at the innovation programs that Stewart talked about with Cider and with Rickard's Shandy coming through Canadian we just launched, we believe we're pushing all the right buttons to make sure that, that structural issue with which we're dealing is being addressed. Very similar to what we're trying to do in the U.S., if you look at it.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess, Mark, a couple of questions on Central and Eastern Europe. First, on the level of brand spending. Generally, can you speak to where we are in that evolution? Shortly after you purchased StarBev, you spoke about what we've seen, this pickup in spend levels. And it seems to be working out in terms of the share performance. Where are we in that evolution, in your opinion? And can you give us some sense, as you've picked up the rate of spend, how much has been on the trade side of things, and how much has been more on the pull\/consumer side of things?","Mark Hunter","Sure. I don't think we ever said that there was a specific start point and end point in terms of the evolution of spending. We are committed to growing our brand portfolio with a focus on core, core plus, above-premium and innovation. And that's where we are investing. Investment, this year, is up on last year. I don't think we've given specific details on that, and we're clearly phasing that as we work our way through the year. So we're committed to invest more to build the strength of the portfolio. And as you say, that's demonstrating, I think, its value, particularly on major markets where we are seeing our share growth come through. The spend increase is balanced pretty equally between what I describe as direct-to-consumer and consumer-via-customer. And at the moment, the direct-to-consumer spend does take the biggest proportion, and both are growing roughly equally. If anything, there's an emphasis towards direct-to-consumer spend. And that's particularly to support the innovation agenda. As I think Peter and Gavin mentioned earlier, we've got Carling Cider, Carling Zest, Molson Canadian, Carling Lager going to Croatia,  [indiscernible] Super Dry, 3 new beer mix flavors, the Franciscan Well acquisition in the Republic of Ireland. So the innovation focus and the above-premium and core plus focus with Staropramen, et cetera is, I think, paying dividends. So we will invest wisely and ensure that, that investment is phased and paced at a level which demonstrates a return. And I think that's what we've managed, certainly, to do as we've got off to a relatively strong start to this year.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And I didn't hear any Scotland innovations there, Mark. When's that going to come?","Mark Hunter","All of the above are relevant for Scotland.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And then if I could, you also called out several other countries there in Central Europe as having a better macro picture than you've seen in the past. Can you speak generally to what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior and how it's unfolding versus what we've seen in the last few years?","Mark Hunter","Yes, I mean, I think it's fair to say, across the majority of the European markets, GDP estimates, which -- actual GDP numbers through 2012 were anything from flat to minus 2, 2.5 points. They've improved slightly on a 2013 outlook basis, but they're still running kind of flat to negative, albeit a slight improvement. So I'm going to say, I'm certainly bullish from an overall economic perspective and from a consumer demand perspective. And the fact that we've seen industry volume across the markets in aggregate down a couple of points, and as I mentioned earlier, slightly higher than excluding Romania, would suggest that we're going to have to keep a real focus on not only the top line, through pricing and innovation, but continuing to manage our cost base very effectively. And again, as Peter mentioned, the cost-reduction plan in the U.K. is running bang in line with schedule, and we are being very tight with costs across the rest of our business.","Hiroshi Saji - Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd., Research Division","And finally, on the U.K., Carling you mentioned is picking up share. You're still getting reasonable price mix growth in that market. Can you speak to what's going on with Carling in the U.K. And give us any sense of any divergence between channels across your portfolio in the U.K., on and off trade share trends?","Mark Hunter","Yes, I mean, I think -- to cut to the chase on this, our on-premise performance with Carling has been very solid for the last few years. The major volatility we've seen has principally been around the off-premise channel, and I think we were pretty transparent last year when we said we were out of play with one of the majors from a promotional calendar perspective. The good news is that we've started this year, and Carling us in play across all of the major multiple grocers. And we're feeling, I think, as positive as we can about the opportunity for Carling this year to really kind of get back into a growth spurt, particularly on the core Carling brand where we've got new Carling creative platform, which is going to be released relatively soon and on the back of the innovation agenda, Zest was very successful last year. It's continuing to grow, and Carling Cider is now in market, and there'll be a further Carling addition in July of this year with one of our major customers. So probably feeling as optimistic about Carling as we have done for the last couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Just want to circle back on the U.S. The question centers around shelf space. So first of all, can you think about where you guys are able to place Redd's and Third Shift, where that's taking shelf space from? And then just a little bit more broadly, what you're seeing from shelf space in terms of -- is some of the pressure on the mainstream and sub-premiums coming from reductions in shelf space to benefit the high end?","Peter S. Swinburn","Tom, can I pass it over to you for the detail?","Tom Long","Sure. Redd's is positioned beside Mike's Hard Lemonade. It's price-pointed there. Every now and again, it's put near ciders. We prefer it to be in the FMB section, and it's done quite well there. So that's net new space for us, and that's one of the reasons for the placement, as I mentioned. The premium light space is generally not challenged too much. It's actually the economy space that's been challenged in shelf sets by all the above-premiums.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just 2 questions. One, because I may have missed this, just had you updated at all your outlook for capital spending and free cash flows here?","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes, we did. Gavin can give you that now.","Gavin Hattersley","Bryan, we just reaffirmed what we said in the first quarter call where 2013 free cash flow will be -- underlying basis will be $700 million, plus or minus 10%. And our capital line will be $330 million, which is higher than last year, obviously, because of the addition of our Central Europe business. But both of those are unchanged.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then I guess just more broadly, Peter, if you could give us a little bit of perspective on -- it was about 1 year ago where you articulated really the driver, the need to begin to drive more innovation and basically start to drive more consistent sales growth. And I think in this quarter, you certainly -- it looks like you gained share in Europe. And the mix is -- you've seen some evidence of the mix improvement in the U.S. So I think there's a bit of attention in the market right now about whether going forward, the market wants to see Molson Coors sort of generate a lot more cost savings and maybe there's less of a focus on the sales growth, but on the other hand, you've got a strategy where you really -- I think you've articulated, you really need to start driving the sales growth in order to drive the bottom line. So can you give a little perspective on kind of where you feel today about some of that investment, is it beginning to -- you're beginning to feel comfortable that it's beginning to show up in the results, first? And then second, is it possible to have a model where you're focused on cost, but also driving the top line of the same time?","Peter S. Swinburn","Let me take the second part, first, Bryan. The answer to that is absolutely yes, it has to be. And we continue to do that. And I think Stewart outlined earlier with confidence, and we'll talk more in the investor meeting, but we are confident that -- on the cost saving line. So put that to one side, let's start off with the facts, okay, and let's just look at what we talked about this quarter. If you try and segment it, without going into any more detail, Europe, I think, anyone would accept as a very strong performance. In the U.S., I would argue the underlying fundamentals are very strong. We've got NSR growth of 4%. Our share performance is the best that we've seen probably for about 4 years. And we started off with a very strong innovation program with the outline of the strong innovation program to come. International, we've laid out over the years. We've told you exactly where we're going to get to, and we're bang in line on that program. We're not happy with Canada at the moment. There's some structural reasons for that position, but they're just excuses. We told you where the -- where we believe the weaknesses are and what we're doing to address them. We feel good about the movement we're making on value. We've got more work to do on above-premium, but we've got a strong innovation program coming out and our core brands are performing relatively well. So when you look forward, the real question, I think, is what is going to happen at the macro level with industry demand? And the short answer to that is we don't know the absolute difference between how much of our volume's been affected by weather and how much has been affected by consumer indifference. We believe -- we don't know, we believe a significant amount is down to the weather. And as that improves, then we think we're extremely well positioned to go forward in most of our markets on the basis of that which I've outlined. And Canada is still a work in progress, but we're very confident that we know where we need to look. So really, the best as I can, that would be my summary, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just fair to say, over the last years, you've -- again, going back to the point at your Investor Day, I guess, last year in March where you articulated sort of the strategy in terms of spending -- invest more in the top line. Despite the weather being bad, despite a strike in Canada and the things you really can't control, it hasn't really affected your rate of investment, right? You've invested, and if the macro gets better, you're there in a position to kind of pick that up as the macro gets better. You haven't -- it hasn't really affected your approach to that investment?","Peter S. Swinburn","No, it hasn't. And again, I think you've seen the numbers we've talked about. I mean, we had a high level of investment in the U.S. just before Christmas. We followed that on with a high-level investment in our innovation program. We talked about increased marketing spend in Canada and in Europe. We've talked about investments in our innovation program going forward. So I think the facts are there for you to see that. And again, I'd come back to the point that, if you look at where we were structurally when we talked to you back in March and you look at the business structurally now, I would -- I believe we're in a stronger position. It has  -- the first quarter was affected by consumer demand. You and I can have a view on how much of that is weather and how much is fundamental consumer demand, but we believe that the fundamentals of the business are strong, as I've outlined.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with ISI.","Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering, now that you've had StarBev for a little while, I'm wondering if you can just kind of reflect on where there's been positive surprises and negative surprises as you look at things? And second, the Staropramen just is a wonderful brand, it's a great beer. Any thoughts in terms of bringing that to the U.S.? You talked about being under-indexed at the high end. That could be a really nice superpremium import.","Peter S. Swinburn","Robert, I'll take the high-level answer to that, and I'll let Mark fill in on some of the others. And then Kandy can talk about Staropramen in the U.S. So the high level, really, in terms of the business case and the due diligence that we did on Central Europe, we've had no nasty surprises. And if anything, they've been positive. The only issue that's affected the overall performance of the business versus the business case is what Mark referred to earlier. We had various projections in terms of GDP for the various countries. And by and large, those projections, we're seeing, in hindsight, they did seem to be optimistic. But over and above that, the absolute structure in terms of what we thought we were getting, where we thought we might have issues, specifically Romania and Hungary, the opportunities in terms of Staropramen, innovation, putting -- premiumizing the business, they've all really come to fruition. So we're very pleased and satisfied that what we expected to happen has really happened. Mark, any builds on that?","Mark Hunter","Yes, probably just 2 or 3 things to touch on. You asked a question about positives and negatives. I have to say, the list of negatives would be very short. Probably the Romanian and Hungarian market are more challenging than we anticipated, but we've been dealing with that. We've made some changes to our leadership teams there, and we've got a very clear plan of action, which we're now executing. If you leave that to one side, I think on the positives, we're very pleased with the talent accretion that we've seen on our business. Some very, very capable leaders who are adding a lot of value. And there's a real focus within the business from what I would describe as an operational excellence perspective, both in supply chain, and we're now taking the best of the StarBev systems, integrating that with the Molson Coors legacy systems to create something, which is even more powerful. And that's already starting to be rolled across the supply chain network to really drive further efficiency and effectiveness. And in the area of commercial, the commercial excellence program that exists is being, to use our internal language, lifted and shifted back into other parts of the Molson Coors organization, particularly the U.K. and in Canada. So a real focus on trying to drive further executional effectiveness right at the front end of our business. The one area where I think we are adding value within the StarBev business, in particular, is really just trying to give the business more of a medium to long-term focus to really balance that short-term operational excellence orientation. So we're, I think, in a great place actually in terms of blending the kind of longer-term perspective, the brand and innovation focus that we have more broadly across Molson Coors with the real kind of operational excellence focus that exists within the StarBev business. And I have to say, having been in the business now for 10 months, I feel very good about what we've acquired and what we're creating here. With regard to your question on the Staropramen, that's a slightly complicated because of the existing MillerCoors relationship and an existing distributor relationship that's been in place for Staropramen in the U.S. But we are -- we agree with your sentiment on the brand, and we're working our way through how we could activate that. And Peter, I don't know whether you want to comment on that further?","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes, thanks, Mark. Kandy?","Krishnan Anand","Robert, first, we are really pleased that you like Staropramen. We think it's a fabulous beer, too. Certainly, my favorite these days. As Mark mentioned, the reason we have not moved Staropramen on to our MillerCoors system is because of an existence of a longer-term importer contract that we have with an importer here in the U.S. So we've agreed with MillerCoors to continue to build this brand, at least, during the remaining term of this longer-term contract. And we've just started working now with this importer to really build the brand step-by-step and make it available in the right way, in the right markets, in the right bars. It's going to be -- it's like a slow-burn craft brand, but we will build it with this importer as part of our overall export growth business for Staropramen.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","Peter S. Swinburn","Okay. Well, thank you, Candice. And thank you, everybody, for joining us today and for the questions. And we look forward to speaking to you at our analyst conference in New York in June.

Hello, everybody, and welcome. On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2013 follow-up earnings conference call.","Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible, following our regular earnings conference call with Peter Swinburn, Gavin Hattersley and our business unit CEOs earlier today. We will use a standard question-and-answer format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour.","So let's get started with an introduction of the team with me on this call. We have Kevin Kim, Investor Relations Manager; Spencer Schurr, Finance Forecasting Manager; Katie Walter, Senior Forecasting Analyst; Erik Mickelson, Manager of Technical Accounting; Ashley Walker, Manager of SEC reporting; Brian Tabolt, Senior Director of Technical and SEC accounting; and Mark Saks, VP of Tax.","As Peter Swinburn mentioned on our regular earnings call earlier today, in the third quarter, Molson Coors increased underlying after-tax earnings nearly 8%, expanded gross margins and underlying pretax margins and grew underlying EBITDA and free cash flow. As we anticipated on our earnings call last quarter, consumer demand was weak across our markets. Despite this, we have continued to invest in our core brands.","Our innovation pipeline is delivering a mid-single-digit percent of sales and our owned above-premium brand portfolio is growing at a double-digit rate globally. We also made progress on our global cost savings and cash generation targets, paid down nearly $282 million worth of net debt in the quarter and continue to standardize processes to reduce complexity and improve efficiency.","Across our markets, we continue to see weak consumer demand and shifts in consumer preferences that will impact our business for some time. In that environment, however, we will accelerate our commitment to transformational efforts to grow our brands and make Molson Coors more competitive and to drive total shareholder return going forward.","So with that, we'd now like to open it up for your questions. Back over to you, Tracy.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Dave, a couple of questions relating to Canada, trying to better understand the Modelo change there. And just looking through the Q, it sounds like you add those numbers that Stewart was referencing. In other words, the Q talks about a year-to-date number of $9 million in equity income and then a year-to-date number of, I believe, if I'm this reading this right here, $9 million in reimbursement for some costs. Is that the right way to think about what's going away? Obviously, we don't what the future number would be, but in terms of what the run rate numbers have been, is that right way to think about that?","David Dunnewald","Yes, I think that's a good start, especially from a year-to-date basis. I think for your -- from your perspective, it's also useful to know that on an annualized basis, say, in recent years, the equity income from those brands in Canada has been in the range of $12 million to $15 million pretax per year, which flows through the cost of goods line. And then we had $5 million to $7 million worth of, what we call, administrative fee reimbursements, and those hit the MG&A line. And then in addition, we have some variable costs of $3 million to $5 million that have been reimbursed. Now those variable costs go away. So when the brands go away, those costs go away with the brand. But the other elements, the first 2 that I mentioned, that's equity income that we won't get. In a sense, we're getting paid for that through the $70 million payment from ABI for [indiscernible]","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got it, got it, got it. So it's really those 2 -- those first 2 items that Stewart mentioned that are more of the go-forward loss?","David Dunnewald","Yes, if you're looking for, call it, impact in the absence of any changes in the business, in other words, any additional brands we might drag through the business, through innovation or what have you, then yes. In other words, static steady state, that's the -- that's what the impact has been in recent years with those brands.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's great. Okay. And then kind of in that same vein, could you remind us where you stand in Canada with this lawsuit relating to the Miller brand?","David Dunnewald","Yes, right now, there is no significant update, I guess. At this point, we have a temporary injunction, so that we continue to manage the brands. We think we're doing -- well, we're working hard to manage those brands in a way that's right for them in Canada. And at the same time, we have a court date in December.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","December, got it. And what's the -- do you have a rough market share figures for the Modelo portfolio and the brands that are subject to this suit in the case of SABMiller?","David Dunnewald","Yes, the -- okay. Those are -- yes, the Modelo brands are low single-digit percent of our portfolio in Canada as a percent of our STRs. And then the Miller brands, same thing, low single-digit percent.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So on a market share basis, also low single-digit?","David Dunnewald","Yes. So lower single-digit. 39% market share in Canada.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. And that's kind of my more business question. What do you think -- so next year, you're going to be competing, call it, 3 points lower than 39% because of the Modelo impact. And Labatt will be competing kind of 3 points higher. I think their shares is around 40%, 41%. What do you think that kind of end market, marketplace effect will be? Obviously, you have, of course, Banqueting introduced. But in terms of just getting the shelf space and being able to compete for attention at the shelf, how do you think that will affect you?","David Dunnewald","Yes. In essence, in Canada, if you sort of stack up all the brands we have from top of the category to the bottom of the category, we believe we still have a very strong portfolio in Canada and we are working on an ongoing basis to enhance that portfolio. And we have evidence that with recent moves in that marketplace, we now have the largest-selling cider in the market. We, obviously, have the largest beer of any -- largest beer in the marketplace in Coors Light. Molson Canadian is doing well. We have strengthened our sub-premium or value offerings in that market. And so we feel good about the portfolio we have and we're just going to continue to drive it forward. You're right, though, this does have a share impact but it's relatively modest, at least in absolute numbers.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's great. That's very helpful. And finally, Coors Banquet. I think you have MillerCoors release at seventh consecutive years of growth in the U.S. Just trying to get some sense of dimension, potential of that brand in Canada, how you guys are thinking about? Obviously, it's new there. But can you give us anything to think about how you're thinking about its potential there?","David Dunnewald","Yes, not a lot of specifics, but I would say right. Banquet has 7 years of growth in a declining segment in the U.S. And really has had done nicely in the face of not only that, but some very tough macroeconomic times. In Canada, there's a lot of spillover in brands, messaging -- anyway, a lot of spillover across border between -- when you have brands between the U.S. and Canada. It works both ways. And so we're really excited about the opportunity for Banquet in Canada because, obviously, it's doing well in the U.S. and has a long heritage. And we think that will ring true with a lot of Canadian beer drinkers.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Do you know offhand portion of mix or market share in the U.S.?","David Dunnewald","No, the easy answer is low single-digits. But I mean, really low. It's a relatively small brand. We just figured Coors Light's essentially high single-digits and Banquet would be, yes, low single-digits.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ian Shackleton with Nomura.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Yes, Dave. I have a couple of areas I wanted to follow up on. First, there was quite a bit of talk around further cost-cutting moves in Canada. And if I wrote it down properly, there was some talk about completing the efficiency structure by mid-2015. And I wonder if I just got that right. And I guess, what I'm really trying to get as well here, is this all part of the programs announced in Investor Day in the summer? Or are we actually thinking about further programs on top of what was envisioned in that stage?","David Dunnewald","Yes, this program is envisioned in the $40 million to $60 million of cost savings that were -- that we committed to in June or talked about in June. And as you may recall, we said it -- actually Gavin -- Gavin actually said it. At the high end of that range, for the next 2 to 3 years and the $40 million to $60 million overall for at least 5 years. So -- but really, the main point is we're looking at ways to make sure that our cost structure is competitive on an ongoing basis. So this isn't necessarily the end of the line on bad cost savings even within that $40 million to $60 million that we talked about.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And so the importance of the mid-2015 date, did I get that down correctly or...","David Dunnewald","Sorry. Yes, you heard it exactly right. That's what Stewart said. And the reason is any time you have, what I would call, a broad-based benchmarking type of exercise in a business, then some changes can be done relatively quickly and some take quite a bit longer.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Right. But was that particularly talking about the production infrastructure or is that the cost of the whole business?","David Dunnewald","Well, he said ramp up mid-2015, he was really talking about the overall effort that he was referring to. In other words, across supply chain and G&A and so on. I would tell you, though, that generally speaking, the supply chain takes more time because you're dealing with processes in breweries and just figuring out how do we make things more efficient.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Understood. The second thing that I just wanted to talk about was, I think Gavin mentioned earlier on not quite a lot of debt repayments. And I'm just wondering what we should be thinking about for the average coupon for next year, really, for FY '14?","David Dunnewald","Okay, let's see. There are 2 ways you could attack that. One would be just to look at the debt that we have outstanding in the 10-Q, and you can sort of tone up a coupon from that, which will get you -- it sounds pretty close to me. The other way to think about it is now that the -- I guess, piece of perspective I'd add is now that our convertible debt is substantially all paid off, then the cash coupon looks an awful lot like the booth coupon. So that will make the math a little easier.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. But if we pick up the Q, that should give us really all the pieces that we need there?","David Dunnewald","Yes, it's all right in there. Brian may even have a page number for you. Give him a second.","Brian D. Goldner","Page 26, footnote 12.","David Dunnewald","Here you go. He's not familiar with that document, is he?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Dave, so first, just on Canada. So the gap between the sales volume and STR of about 2 points, I think you called out some inventory de-stocking. Can you just give us a little bit of color on what happened in the quarter? Is this something that will be ongoing? Or does this reverse next quarter?","David Dunnewald","Yes, good question. No, actually, what happened was when we rolled into second quarter this year, we wanted to make sure that we had a little bit more robust inventories in some particular channels on certain particular brands this year versus what we had last year. So we ended the second quarter this year with a bit higher inventories and trade, so to speak. And that's wholesalers; in some cases, retailers; in some cases, in-transit; then, in other cases, actually governmental entities when you're talking about Canada. So we wanted a bit more inventory in the second quarter leading into peak season. We accomplished that, so we ended the second quarter with a bit higher inventories in those channels, so to speak. And then we, essentially, they brought them back down by the end of the third quarter. So at the end of the third quarter this year, on a year-to-date basis, we're essentially in line with the prior year.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. Okay. And then just on the volume performance in Canada, I think you had given some of the brand numbers, but I don't know if you've actually quantified how much Molson Canadian was up and Coors Light was down and others. So could you help us just kind of go through your key brands and the volume performance in the quarter in Canada?","David Dunnewald","Yes, sure, I can give you a few headlines on that. It's, at least, somewhat general. Let's see, Spencer's got -- yes, we said that Molson Canadian performed relatively well, actually picked up some share in the quarter. So the market was down about 1% and Canadian was down less than the market. The Coors Light was down at a, call it, a high single-digit rate. And let's see, what other ones do you care about? Obviously, Coors Banquet was up strongly on a 0 base from the year before, which is particularly meaningful. But Keystone Light is a relatively important brand and that one grew at a double-digit rate. As you may know the value segment in Canada is a growth segment unlike in the U.S. And then the other important brands, we've got the Carling brand up in Canada, and that one declined slightly. Our Craft brands, importantly, at the top end of the category, such as Rickard's and Creemore and Granville Island, all grew at healthy rates and gained share. Does that give you a heads start?","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, yes, that's helpful. So just on Coors Light high single-digit decline, how much of that was the Iced T portion and -- versus kind of the underlying Coors Light?","David Dunnewald","Yes, Iced T was a factor. It still would've -- that brand still would have been down at least mid-single digits without Coors Light Iced T.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay. So the point there is you had sort of the benefit of the Iced T last year. On top of that, you probably had more activation on the underlying Coors Light, given the Iced T launch and other activities that you had implemented last year. So kind of lapping that, made the Coors Light a little bit more challenging?","David Dunnewald","Yes, I would say, that's exactly right. We had some challenging comps around Coors Light, not only related to Iced T, but also related to weather. And I would say this year, we had fewer impact promotions than some of our competitors. And when you have the biggest brand in the market, that can have a greater impact than if you're a smaller brand. So these are things that, along with new ad copy and so forth, that Stewart talked about this morning, that we're working on around our largest brand in Canada.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And when you look at the October trends, Canada, up low single-digits in STR, are you seeing some moderation in terms of the decline in Coors Light in that context?","David Dunnewald","I would say that we are seeing -- and I'm not going to drill into October, STRs for Coors Light. But, let's say, more broadly in October, you do have the return of hockey, which is a good thing. You also -- but then as Stewart mentioned earlier, this morning, that we're still going against a really relatively tough macroeconomic environment and, call it, weak consumer confidence and some promotional challenges in the Canadian market. So those things continue and it is nice to pick up hockey, but you can't lose sight of those other pieces as well.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, okay. And then on the COGS line for Canada, so just the sequential moderation, I guess, we had always expected the back half to be a little bit more favorable. But it just seems like the drop in the third quarter versus the first half was a bit more dramatic, so -- and especially, given that volume was also negative, so you're still kind of suffering from the fixed cost de-leveraging. Anything to call out there? Was there any timing benefit? Or anything that kind of helped your third quarter COGS per unit in Canada more?","David Dunnewald","In -- sorry, in the third quarter?","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","In the third quarter, yes.","David Dunnewald","Yes. No, nothing comes to mind. Let's see, now I would say that there's very little hockey benefit that we would pick up in Canada. The increase in MG&A expense actually is more of a challenge in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Well, a little bit more of a COGS comment. Your COGS were, in Canada, up in 1 -- was it 1.5% or so in the third quarter and it's been running 6%, 6.5% in the first half?","David Dunnewald","Yes. So we did have a bit more cost reductions in the third quarter, but they can have a little bit of ebb and flow there. But I don't think that -- I wouldn't call that a major factor. No, I don't think there was anything in particular that comes to mind but -- and I mean, yes, we had normal sort of -- I mean, think about the cost of goods line in a business that size made up of thousands of different lines and entries that build up to the final COGS line. We've seen some favorability on some pieces of input inflation line, if you will. But I wouldn't call out a major driver and as I say, there's just a bit of an ebb and flow to that type of line within that kind of range is not uncommon.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right, right. Okay, got it.","David Dunnewald","Our guidance is maintained for the year, right?","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. But you have a wide range in terms of mid-single digits, particularly?","David Dunnewald","Yes, correct.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of the free cash flow. So the first, just the CapEx by coming down by, I think, $30 million or so. Can you talk about what's driving the decline? Is it more timing? Or are you just deciding that some of the projects are not worth spending in this year?","David Dunnewald","Well, every year, we like to be very tight on capital. And so that's not new. But I would say if anything, we're raising the bar on that with the pack model that Gavin has talked about that we're pushing through the organization. And I would -- it's all about returns on capital.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the free cash flow guidance coming up towards the upper end of that $700 million plus\/minus 10%, is it mostly just CapEx?","David Dunnewald","Mostly CapEx. Well, that would be one factor. But really, our free cash flow is built on a lot of different things and including working capital, obviously, financial performance and so it's not just CapEx.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then can you remind me how much you have left in the cross-currency swap settlement?","David Dunnewald","Yes, we'll see if Brian or Spencer can come up with a specific number. But we -- my recollection is we have -- well, I don't have to recall, Brian is finding it.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, at the -- as noted in the 10-Q, we have $134 million outstanding as of the end of September. However, we settled an additional amount early in the fourth quarter of an additional $51.4 million.","David Dunnewald","Well, does that leave us with a net out of the money of about $80 million then?","Brian D. Goldner","Approximately, it does move with...","David Dunnewald","That's cool. It will move with FX and other column adjustments. But that's been -- well, primarily FX. But around $80 million left, Judy, at current FX rates. I should say end of quarter FX rates, shouldn't I?","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is the plan just to settle all of that this year or some of that gets spilled over into 2014?","David Dunnewald","We'll see. It's due in 2014, but as you can tell because actually, the stuff that we just settled was due in 2014. We make decisions on -- in that area kind of an ongoing basis depending on how much cash generation we have and what the pros and cons are from an organizational stand or I shouldn't say organization -- from a shareholder value standpoint. In other words, what makes the most sense.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave, a couple of questions. I guess, the first one, if you look at the MillerCoors JV, I think the savings, cost savings identified in the quarter was $33 million and I know we were modeling something more like $25 million. And so was there any benefit at all from the headcount reduction that was just recently announced? Or was there any other sort of unusual thing that occurred in the quarter just to cause that to be as high as it was?","David Dunnewald","The short answer is no, not related to the announcement. That announcement was certainly not implemented before the end of the quarter. But as with some of the other things we've discussed about cost of goods, for example, there can be a bit of an ebb and flow to cost savings as well when they come in, so to speak. So we had a lot of supply chain savings in MillerCoors in the third quarter, but also some logistics, some productivity, brewing process. I mean, it's the usual types of savings but just the mixture and magnitude was a bit different in the third quarter.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just say on MillerCoors again, the price mix was helped a lot by mix, and that's a function of some of the new products. And it sounds -- I guess, just trying to get a sense because the cost per COGS, per hectoliter is also up. So I'm just -- as we try to model out just how to think about how a higher mix of those products like Redd's, for instance, affect the P&L, it's -- is it somewhat neutral in terms of what happens on the gross profit line, meaning there are higher revenue per unit, but not necessarily a higher gross margin per unit?","David Dunnewald","Well, let's see. So you're thinking about it in the right way. NSR per hectoliter, net sales revenue per hectoliter, is higher on brands like Redd's. And the cost of goods are higher as well, generally speaking, on the above-premium brands. But these are good margin brands. I mean, I'm not going to be too specific. But if we have above-premium brands, unless it's a situation where we're giving the lion's share of the profit stream to the brand owner and we've seen that in, for example, in the Modelo brands in some markets and that sort of thing, then above premium generally means healthy margins.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, so -- because I was -- so it's -- theoretically, they would be higher gross margin. And then, the comments that, I guess, Tom made on the call about there being the payback period being or the breakeven period, maybe being some on these new ones 3 years is more just a function of what's being spent on marketing and SG&A as opposed to there being a real gross margin differential?","David Dunnewald","Yes, I think -- yes, Tom's comments, I think, are right. They go largely toward -- talk about the or essentially towards the flow of the MG&A investment in the brands. The gross margins don't change significantly as you move through the introduction. But I think again, you're thinking about it the right day. Above-premium brands tend to have more robust gross margins than value brands, for example. Sometimes, you have scale differences that you need to take into account. But for the same-sized brand, that generally holds true. I would add -- there's one other thing I'd add. Some other -- so we talk about innovations and how we're spending more behind them. It's also throw into the mix packaging innovations can add cost and generally also revenue. So that's another, call it, mixed components. But not, I would say, not as important as the new brands like Redd's and the Third Shift that we've talked about previously.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, just following back on Ian Shackleton's question earlier, I was just trying to think about the shape of net interest expense next year, I guess I've got 2 components that are going to affect it, right? It looks like from -- I inferred from what you said earlier and although I admit I haven't looked at Page 26 in the Q yet, is that interest -- did the interest rate, the coupon rate is going to be lower next year and then the other thing I'm factoring in is some -- if you're sort of targeting what your leverage ratios are going to be by the end of next year, you're going to have some debt reduction as well. So I should have some leverage, positive leverage on the net interest line next year just based on those 2 components, is that right?","David Dunnewald","Debt pay down? Yes, that is priority cash use. So I'll let you decide how you want to actually model that out, but that makes a lot of sense. When you say the coupon's lower, actually, I'm not sure I -- I mean, depends on how you define coupon. If you really mean the average percent...","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's the average rate, yes, you'd pay on your debt.","David Dunnewald","Yes, actually the debt that we'd paid off, well, this year it was a mixture. On a book basis, the $575 million convertible was actually somewhat on the high side for coupon. Obviously, it was paid off end of July. And then the -- however, the 0 coupon euro convertible on a book basis, that was extremely low coupon. I think you might actually be more successful modeling it out, just take the debt outstanding, go to the Page 29 or 26 that Brian mentioned and then you can get kind of an average coupon for an amount of debt. And then at the same time, think about what you think we might be able to accomplish as far as debt paydown goes. That will get you closer. But having said all that stuff about the coupon, I mean, yes, we have less debt outstanding. So lower total interest expense, we'll see what rates do a some of the debt that is outstanding, revolvers or what have you. But I'd say you'd got to be able to get an estimate off of that.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Okay. And then just on the tax rate, so can you just -- so now we've got this sort of hypothetical factor in the future where the tax rate would go back up, migrate back up to kind of more normal tax rate, but we're not really sure where that is in the future. You may be, but we don't. So I'm just trying to understand. I mean, from this year's sort of tax rate coming in kind of lower than what was originally thought, if I understood everything that was said, it's largely a function of some changes in statutory rates in Canada and some other -- those types of things and not necessarily settlements that happen to come up and take your tax rate down. So a, is that true? And then b, just as we think about the ramp to a more normal tax rate, how much is left still that of tax matters that are unsettled that have to be settled? And as we start to think about modeling the tax rate next year and over the next couple of years, how steep do you think that curve is? Or is that -- did the slope of that curve change at all?","David Dunnewald","Yes, okay. So in Canada, it was actually tax law changes. The rates didn't actually change. We've got some FIN 48 roll-offs that also had an effect. But that's just detail. What I would want to know if I were you, okay 13% to 15% tax rate for the year, about 4 percentage points of benefit from onetime tax stuff, including the things I just mentioned. So that gets you to more of, call it, a normalized rate, if you will. And then we said that we expect to move toward that 20% to 24% long-term tax rate over the next few years, which I define that as 3 to 5 years. That stuff could change. So obviously, all that is caveated by assuming no changes in tax laws and those types of things.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It just feels like it's been 3 to 5 years for the last 10. So I'm just trying to understand if we're closer to the...","David Dunnewald","Yes, and that's a fair question. And of course, the reason is we've actually seen corporate income tax rates coming down around the world. Except, of course, in the U.S. That's been really significant in Canada, the U.K. We've added the Central Europe business that has relatively low tax rates, average of 10% to 20%, depending on which country you're in. So I'd say if you put that all that together, you're right, it's -- that progression has been delayed for those reasons.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question. Just related to the asset write-downs in StarBev. Is there a -- so if you've changed the cash flow expectations for those brands, does it change the cash flow expectations in total for what you thought StarBev in aggregate was going to generate?","David Dunnewald","So yes, the value of the brands are lower, the way that they are valued is discount of cash flows. I guess, the best answer is we reiterated our guidance that we expect to be driving, what we call, shareholder value or ROIC over WACC in the 3- to 5-year time frame. And I would also emphasize that the while those 2 brands warrant that they're write-down based on impairment testing and DCF valuations and those types of things, we had other, really, substantial brands that actually grew in value. And Gavin mentioned earlier today, Staropramen and Nik\u0161icko and some others in that market. And the overall Europe segment valuation is certainly above carrying value.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then do those -- does the write-down at all affect, I guess, what your ongoing depreciation and amortization would be? And also does it have any effect on your tax rate, like is there a loss or some other benefit that you'd get at some point down the road because of that as a credit, I should say?","David Dunnewald","Yes. So the -- let's see. Yes, the brand in Czech Republic, that one actually is moving to a definite live, Ostravar, a definite live depreciation schedule. But that does not have a significant impact on our overall depreciation, call it, flow, if you will. So I'd say, in that case, not particularly. I don't think I want to front-run the tax folks on what the implications are for tax around the brand write-downs, but if we have anything significant there, we'll update you at the right time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Pat Palozzi with Beutel Goodman.","Pat Palozzi","Dave, questions for you just with respect to Canada again. I just want to get a better handle on the volume and the mix. So if you look at it over the last few years, has the volume decline been larger in bottles versus cans? And has that been one of the negative factors when you call out mix?","David Dunnewald","Generally speaking, absolutely. The volume challenges do lean much more toward bottles, especially in the East. And that does create a cost challenge because you have to continually adjust your cost structure around returnable bottles. Saying that that's a driver, a specific driver of mix in any given period, I'd say it doesn't pop up that way. But over a longer period of time, it is a mix challenge for us. Now if you mean on the -- now, I'm talking specifically about the cost of goods line there.","Pat Palozzi","Yes, yes. Yes, that's exactly what I wanted to get at, that's right.","David Dunnewald","Yes, if you're talking about revenue then that's a different question, and I'd say kind of minimal impact.","Pat Palozzi","So then that's been one of the challenges with you not being able to lower your COGS faster or control your costs better?","David Dunnewald","Well, it's one of many challenges, along with input inflation and pension costs and all kinds of other things, fixed-cost deleverage, yes. So it's one challenge.","Operator","Your next question is from Jesse Reinherz with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Dave, a quick one for you on marketing spend. Just trying to get a sense of the size in the uptick. First in Canada, I know you guys after the second quarter had talked to a $12 million benefit from the timing of marketing. And I'm trying to figure out, it looks like this, obviously, hasn't been recorded in the third quarter. Is there anything you can kind of give us on what size of an uptick we should be looking for in the fourth quarter?","David Dunnewald","Well, yes -- no. Very good -- very observant of view. We did say that in the second quarter. And that is correct, we did not see a significant uptick in the third quarter. And so yes, it's primarily -- it's, how do you say, largely to be resolved in the fourth quarter.","Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got you. So all of that $12 million is going to be the fourth. And then is there -- I mean, can we assume, obviously, it was down again in the third. Is there -- do you think it will be in addition to $12 million? Or should we view that as kind of the run rate, I guess?","David Dunnewald","I would say we had a benefit in the second quarter and we anticipate that, that benefit will largely reverse in the fourth quarter. So I don't think I'll isolate on the third quarter for you. And I'd reiterate that that's partially driven by NHL, activation and related stuff, related expense.","Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then quickly on Europe, you guys said on the call that you're expecting a higher MG&A in the fourth quarter. Is that relative to the third quarter? Is that relative to the year? I mean, obviously, you guys are up mid-teens in the third quarter, so are we supposed to expect an uptick beyond that?","David Dunnewald","Right. I didn't say specifically how much, so I'm not going to narrow it down much. But the statement was that we expect higher Europe MG&A expense in the fourth quarter. That sounds like a percentage increase year-over-year in local currency.","Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So year-over-year. Okay. Great, that's helpful.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Rob Ottenstein with ISI.","Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Dave, a couple of follow-up questions to some of the prior questions. In terms of the brands where you had the write-downs, roughly what percentage of your volumes did they represent in Serbia and Czech Republic?","David Dunnewald","Yes. So I'm not going to break it out by country. But the Ostravar brand in Czech, it's our third largest brand in the Czech Republic. And as you may know, we have somewhere in the teens share, between 10% and 20% share in that marketplace. So as you can tell, the third largest brand is not all that big. Staropramen is a decent sized brand in Czech Republic, but not Ostravar. Yellen is our largest brand in Serbia, so it is a significant brand in that market. And so, let's see, so I would say of the total Europe segment, we'd be in the mid-single-digit range for those 2 brands as a percent of Europe. So obviously, globally, it'd be much lower than that.","Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And would it be fair to say that the brand in Serbia was more of an issue with Serbia, whereas the one in the Czech Republic was more competitive?","David Dunnewald","Actually, I'd flip that around. The Czech brand, the issue was really local economics. The region where Ostravar is strong in the Czech Republic, they've had a number of factory shutdown, the economy there. If you think the eurozone has got challenges, the region where Ostravar sells is -- has really had a tough stretch economically. And so the consumer base is particularly suffering there. We're not suffering disproportionately in that market. It's just that particular region of the Czech Republic. The Yellen brand is a combination of eurozone challenges, Serbian economy, consumer confidence, some extra competitive activity, including at the value end of the category. So it's really a range of things in Serbia. And also, the -- which by the way, are reflected in the discount rates that we mentioned on the earlier call, as well as having a higher income tax rate, the 50% increase in Serbia this year, that's been a little tough on consumers, too. So I'd say Yellen is a combination of macroeconomics, market challenges and, call it, some competitive activity as well.","Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess, it was just kind of news to me that you'd write down the value of brands based on local economics rather than brand health considerations, so that's interesting.","David Dunnewald","Sorry, when we look at brand impairments, we have to look at a variety of factors. And one thing that goes into the discounted cash flows that are the primary driver of brand valuations is what's going on in the economy, what do we think sales will look like over a longer period of time or I should say a very long period of time. And the economy is part of that calculation.","Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, well, obviously, a lot of forecasting there.","David Dunnewald","It's fun stuff. One note, Bryan mentioned if you want details on those asset impairments, you can look at Page 23, footnote 11 in the 10-Q.","Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","All right. In terms of the $70 million you're getting for Corona in Canada, is that a pretax or after-tax amount? And any sense of how that gets taxed? And will that be used to pay down debt? Or to be reinvested in the market?","David Dunnewald","Yes, it's $70 million is the pretax number, call it, payment for the acceleration of the contract. We accelerated it 3 years and 10 months is the agreement. How that will be used, I guess the short answer is we're going to use it in -- along with all of our other cash uses, we're just going to look for the highest return for our shareholders.","Operator","Since there are no further questions at this time, I turn the call back over to Mr. Dunnewald.","David Dunnewald","Great.

Our global priority brands grew 4.6%.","U.S. GAAP net income increased 4%, and underlying non-GAAP net income increased 2.9%, driven by increased brand volume, higher net pricing, positive sales mix, cost savings and lower marketing spending, partially offset by a higher underlying effective tax rate. This non-GAAP result was up nearly 50% on a reported basis, which demonstrates the substantial earnings accretion from the MillerCoors transaction.","In the second quarter, we reported nearly $794 million of underlying EBITDA, a 4.2% increase from the pro forma result a year ago. In constant currency, underlying EBITDA was up 5.7%. Year-to-date underlying free cash flow was $586.7 million, which more than tripled versus $176.9 million in the first half of 2016. This significant increase was driven by the addition of the other 58% of MillerCoors cash flows, as well as lower cash paid for taxes, which were partially offset by higher cash paid for interest. With this strong free cash flow, we reduced our net debt by more than $522 million in the second quarter.","Now, I'd like to share some regional highlights for the second quarter. In the U.S., we grew net sales and underlying EBITDA on a pro forma basis, with 7.9% earnings growth driven by lower MG&A expenses, higher net pricing, positive sales mix, and cost savings. U.S. domestic net sales per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, grew 1% for the quarter as a result of higher net pricing and positive sales mix, partially offset by cycling a multi-year adjustment in federal excise tax expense last year. Cycling this adjustment in federal excise tax reduced our NSR per hectoliter by 40 basis points this quarter.","Overall, U.S. STRs declined 1.9%, but against the backdrop of a weak industry, we achieved our best first-half market share trend in more than three years. STRs were particularly soft late in the second quarter, which drove moderately higher than planned inventories for our distributors at the end of the quarter, but also lower out of stocks around the 4th of July holiday. We expect the majority of this additional inventory to be sold through by the end of the third quarter.","We grew our share of the Premium Light segment, with Coors Light achieving its ninth consecutive quarter of increased segment share and Miller Lite reaching 11 consecutive quarters of increased segment share. Overall, our Premium Light segment volumes were down low-single digits. Coors Banquet grew volume at a mid-single-digit rate and also increased segment share.","Our total Above Premium segment returned to growth, up low-single digits, driven by both our regional and national craft brands. Blue Moon Belgian White, Leinenkugel's, and Peroni grew strongly, while Redd's and Henry's posted lower volume. Zima, which returned to the U.S. market for a limited period, was Nielsen's number five growth brand for the four weeks ending July, the 1st. Our below-premium brands were down low-single digits for the second consecutive quarter, a significant trend improvement from the last \u2013 the past several years.","Our Canada underlying EBITDA declined 9.7% on a reported basis, primarily due to the impact of lower volume, input cost inflation, and negative foreign currency movements. Underlying EBITDA in constant currency was 7.2% lower. Overall Canada brand volume declined 1.3%, as a result of lower domestic volumes, partially driven by soft industry volume.","Including the return of the Miller brands to our portfolio, we increased overall market share for the second consecutive quarter. Coors Light and Molson Canadian volumes declined in the quarter. Nonetheless, we continued to drive our First Choice agenda, including revenue management strategies, to bring momentum back to the top line. As a result, net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 2.3%, driven by positive pricing and brand mix, primarily due to higher import brand volume.","We continued to premiumize our portfolio through volume and market share gains by import brands led by Coors Banquet; above-premium craft brands including Belgian Moon and Granville Island; and the addition of the Miller brands.","Europe grew underlying EBITDA 13.8%, which equates to 21.3% growth in constant currency, driven by higher volume, positive sales mix, the quarterly timing of marketing investments, increased net pension benefits, and the later timing of the Easter holiday this year. These positive factors were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements. Brand volume increased 11.5% in the second quarter, primarily driven by the transfer of royalty and export brand volume across Europe from our International business and the addition of the Miller brands, along with the timing of Easter and strong growth from our core and above-premium brands.","Net sales per hectoliter increased 3.7% in local currency due to positive mix and net pricing.","Underlying EBITDA for our International business was a loss of $0.9 million, which improved from a loss of $1.7 million a year ago. Brand volume increased more than 40% in the second quarter to 1.2 million hectoliters. Our second quarter net sales grew more than 65% due to higher volume, along with positive pricing, while net sales per hectoliter declined 5.5% due to sales mix changes. This increase was driven by the transfer of our Puerto Rico business from MillerCoors, the addition of the Miller global brands, and Coors Light growth in Latin America, partially offset by the transfer of Europe royalty and export business to the Europe segment.","In Latin America, excluding the addition of Puerto Rico, we grew Coors Light volume at a high-single-digit rate. The Miller brands integration process is continuing to progress as expected, and we have successfully exited almost all of our Transitional Service Agreements during the second quarter. In each of these instances, we have established routes to market that give us a strong platform for growth.","Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the second quarter, as well as our latest outlook and guidance targets.","This quarter, we have made the following adjustments to our guidance metrics: We now expect cost of goods sold per hectoliter for the full year 2017 in our International business to decrease at a mid-single-digit rate, versus a double-digit decrease previously. With the dynamic tax environment in the U.S. right now, we are not changing our tax rate range of 24% to 28%, but our current view is that our full year underlying tax rate will be in the top half of this range.","We now expect cash pension contributions in the range of $300 million to $320 million to defined benefit plans in 2017. This range is $200 million higher than our previous target, as we plan to make an additional discretionary contribution of $200 million to our U.S. plan in the third quarter as part of our deleveraging goal. Rating agencies treat pension under-funded status the same as debt, so this pension contribution will also benefit our investment-grade debt ratings. Note that all of these anticipated pension contributions are included in our 2017 underlying free cash flow target of $1.2 billion, plus or minus 10%.","This discretionary contribution is a strong indication of the progress we are making in achieving our financial plans and quickly paying down debt. We remain committed to reducing our leverage ratio to about four times on a rating-agency basis by the end of 2018.","Looking forward, we are focused on three primary financial targets \u2013 first, cash generation; we made great progress in this area in the second quarter, and we are confident that we will achieve our cash goals this year. Second, deleverage; we reduced our net debt by more than $520 million in the second quarter. And third, we continue to expect the underlying EBITDA margin growth to average between 30 basis points and 60 basis points for the next three years to four years, while we remain focused on growing our top line, as well.","At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for the business outlook, wrap up and the Q&A. Mark?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Tracey. In 2017, we continue to focus on both top and bottom-line performance, driven by our First Choice consumer and customer agenda and the integration of MillerCoors and the Miller brands globally.","My priorities remain unchanged as we shape the new Molson Coors to drive total shareholder returns over the medium to long term. I am leading for a powerful and integrated First Choice culture, the successful integration of our businesses including the associated synergy and cost savings plans, a step change in our global commercial capability to support top line growth, accelerated performance in our international markets, further global productivity improvements through World Class Supply Chain 2.0, our North American supply chain approach and global procurement, with all of this enabled by a more efficient enterprise approach across global shared services.","We're also investing ahead of the curve for growth in key brands and markets. And as part of this, in the third quarter we plan to invest incrementally at an enterprise level in our brands. With this approach, we're driving for measured and sustainable performance on both the top and bottom line. Through the balance of 2017, our business unit priorities are clear and consistent.","Our U.S. goal of flat volume in 2018 and growth in 2019 remains unchanged. We remain committed to Coors Light and Miller Lite accelerating their segment share gains alongside the strong volume performance of Coors Banquet, and to further improving the volume trajectory of our economy portfolio.","In addition, we took key steps to strengthen and further premiumize our portfolio, including the addition of Sol, as we signed a 10-year agreement with Heineken, commencing in October of this year for us to import, market and distribute the high potential Mexican beer brand. In addition, we recently announced a partnership with Hornell Brewing Company, part of Arizona Beverages, to market and distribute a new beverage called Arnold Palmer Spiked Half & Half, which takes us into the alcohol tea market in a distinctive way.","Along with a resurgent Blue Moon Belgian White, we'll continue to integrate and expand the geographic reach of our recent craft acquisitions, which are growing strongly. Encouragingly, MillerCoors shared the top spot of the 2017 Tamarron distributor survey as the best malt beverage supplier. This marks the second consecutive year that our distributors have rated us as their best brewer across a wide range of metrics, and it is a strong First Choice vote of confidence from our distributors who believe in our imperative of getting to volume growth by 2019.","In Canada, we continued to drive our First Choice agenda to bring momentum back to the top line, including a relentless focus on our two largest brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian. While still under volume pressure, these brands improved their segment share trajectory in the second quarter. In Above Premium, we're driving for further growth in the import, craft and cider segments with Coors Banquet, MGD, Creemore, Granville, Belgian Moon, and the Heineken brand family.","In addition, we're beginning to leverage Miller Lite alongside Coors Light and introduced Miller High Life to simplify our economy portfolio in Canada. In order to further transform our cost base, the construction of our new British Columbia brewery is progressing well, and we recently announced plans to build a more-efficient, more flexible brewery in the Greater Montreal area in the next few years. We expect both of these brewery initiatives will unlock material savings in the medium to long term and deliver a highly efficient, fit-for-future brewery network.","In Europe, while strengthening our national mainstream brands, we will continue to premiumize our portfolio with a focus on our craft portfolio, Staropramen, Coors Light and cider brands along with the addition of the Miller brands and the royalty and export business in the region. Our craft investments have consistently delivered strong returns, and we are continuing to build a craft portfolio, including Sharp's, Franciscan Well, accelerated expansion of Blue Moon in the region, and the addition of the number-one craft beer in Spain, La Sagra.","In July, we also completed the purchase of Birradamare, a small Italian craft brewery based just outside of Rome, which gives us an opportunity to develop its special brands in Italy and select export markets. Finally, Staropramen is growing very strongly across our European markets, and we've now unified the brand visual identity across the Czech Republic and all international markets.","Our International business will continue to leverage our strong global brands, partnerships and commercial capabilities around the world to grow, in particular Coors, Miller and Blue Moon. One action we are taking is to lift and shift the original white can packaging for Miller Lite to all markets globally in the second half of this year. The scaled-up International business requires upfront investments to grow our brands, and our MG&A will be higher this year, funded by a 2017 step change in gross profit, as we lay the foundation for accelerating top and bottom-line growth from 2018 onwards.","In summary, in the second quarter we continued to drive our First Choice for Consumer and Customer agenda in each of our businesses to deliver top and bottom-line performance. As a sign of progress against this agenda, our teams delivered solid growth across all key financial measures. We exceeded our goals for cash generation and debt reduction in the first half of this year, and we've maintained our investment-grade debt ratings.","Our second quarter performance was inline with our expectations, and we remain on track to deliver our 2017 business and financial plans, cost savings targets, and cash flow goals. Equally important, we continue to make progress in our First Choice for Consumers and Customers agenda in each of our businesses, and we will remain resolute on PACC as a key business decision framework, using our cash to reward investors and critically ensure a healthy balance sheet, reducing costs to provide top line investment firepower, and making smart investments that deliver brand-led growth and shareholder value.","Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment; as usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Although we will not host a follow-up Investor Relations conference call later today, Dave Dunnewald and Kevin Kim will be available via telephone or email to assist with any additional questions you may have regarding our quarterly results.","Additionally, we hope to see many of you at the Barclays Global Consumer Staples Conference in Boston in early September, or at one of our other investor outreach events in the months ahead.","So, at this point, Laura, I would like to open up for questions, please. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question today will come from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow-up a bit with the STRs and STWs into the quarter. And related to that, do you think that marketing spend, as you incurred, if you can elaborate? And I think also, you \u2013 at the same time, you said you're going to be investing more in marketing. So, I wanted to relay the message in the U.S., in particular. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. Hi, Andrea. Gavin, do you want to pick up on STR\/STW question specifically?","Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Sure, Mark. Thanks. Good morning, Andrea. Look, in June, we filled the orders that our distributors placed and when you couple that with lower-than-expected industry-wide sales, it did increase our distributor inventory at the end of the quarter by a couple of days. On the positive side, the higher level of inventory really helped us to increase our service levels, coming into the 4th of July holiday and that worked well for us as we had a 22% reduction in distributor out-of-stocks compared to the last year.","On a full-year basis there, Andrea, our year-to-date STRs are down 2% and our STWs are down 2.1%. So they are converging. And we duly estimate that our Q3 distributor inventory levels will be in line with the prior year. So that implies a pullback in inventories, as Mark said in his prepared remarks. And for the year-end inventory levels, we'll continue to evaluate that, but our current expectation is to ship to consumption within the year.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Gavin. And then, Andrea, just on the other part of your question. With regard to our marketing investments for the year, I mean, clearly, quarter-to-quarter, there is always some fluctuations depending on the timing of activity. We expect our marketing investment on enterprise level to be slightly higher in the third quarter compared to last year.","But right across our business, the number one priority with our marketing spend is to drive higher effectiveness and productivity. You've seen that with the use of the return on marketing investment model or ROMI in the U.S. We've now rolled that into the Canada business and it's starting to really unlock some significant efficiency savings, and we'll be taking that into the UK later this year and into 2018.","So, we'll continue to retain the flexibility on our discretionary line items on our P&L to ensure that we deliver our bottom line, but we will also balance that with ensuring that we're investing at the right level to drive our brand performance. And I think, you've seen that with our share performance virtually across all of our markets.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, would you say \u2013 that's very helpful. Would you say that the marketing spend decline was mostly non-working spending decline or how \u2013 just to help us bridge that the improvement in margin, if that is recurrent?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Some of it was timing. Some of it was non-working, and you're starting to see the benefit of us really now looking an aggregated approach in terms of our marketing spend, our agency partners and our procurement impact as we drive our global procurement agenda. So, that some of that's starting to play through in terms of unlocking value which we can either drop to the bottom line or invest back in the business. That's good news as the integration proceeds positively.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, both.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Andrea.","Operator","And our next question comes from Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone. I've got a question, I mean, on contract brewing. It has been declining by about 16% in the quarter. What was the driver? I mean, is it structural or is it kind of the running rate of, I mean, the manufacturers you are saying too, or how should we think about these going forward, as it has impacted your top line growth, revenue per hectoliter, and bottom line.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. So, Laurent, thanks for the question. So, I mean clearly contract brewing is something which is an arm's length relationship that we have. It's included within our financial volume, but it's not a focus for the leadership team and the business. So, the majority of people in our organization we have to deliver on the demand that comes through from the third parties that we have that contract brewing relationship with. So, to be honest the contract brewing volumes will fluctuate based on the success of those third party brands in the marketplace and we can't really influence that. And I would just remind you it's relatively low margin business. Clearly it gives us overhead recovery. So, it's not a big driver of our overall financial performance.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. So, therefore should we think about you thinking about moving away from this business and how we should think about the pubs business you are manufacturing in the U.S.?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Well, I think, the pub situations are relatively well publicized situations. Clearly, we're in a litigation process at the moment, and that will hopefully come to a conclusion as we get into 2018. So, I really don't want to comment any further on that at this stage.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Laurent.","Operator","And the next question will come from Vivien Azer of Cowen.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hi. Thank you so much. And before I ask my question, I just wanted to say that the new press release format was super helpful. So, thank you for that. It was a much easier earnings update this morning. So, on the Above Premium, so nice to see that that's back into growth. Gavin, perhaps, could you comment on how that benefited your price mix realization in the quarter?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay, Gavin.","Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Sure. Sure, Mark. Thanks. Look, I mean, if you break out our pricing recovery, Vivien, we got 80 basis points of net pricing growth that obviously excludes the 40 basis points impact of the FET drawbacks. And our sales mix added about 60 basis points. And it was attributed really to the improvement we saw across the board in our Above Premium portfolio just driven by the performance of the new craft companies.","The Leinenkugel's Shandy brands, I mean, we're on track to have a record summer with Shandy, Blue Moon Belgian White, and of course, the limited time release of Zima. And we also saw in the second quarter, Henry's trends improved relative to Q1 when the brand was tackling it's the first quarter in the market from 2016. So, I would say those are the hard spots in the Above Premium, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you very much for that. As well staying on the U.S. business please, could you elaborate on your comment on the softening at the end of the quarter? What do you think that's attributed to? And as a kind of part two to that question, could you also comment on the promotional activity in the \u2013 that you've been seeing for the category as a whole? Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Gavin, straight back at you?","Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Mark. Vivien, you're right. It's no secret that the beer industry in June was soft according to Nielsen, and we did see some growth in wine and spirits accelerating in June. And particularly, in the low end with some promotional activity, particularly with vodka. From a beer industry point of view, we obviously need to take wine and spirits seriously as an industry.","And as I mentioned at the BR Conference in July, we need to be pro-beer first and try to differentiate our category from wine and spirits, and we need to do that together. And at MillerCoors, we're committed to investing in our brands and transforming our portfolio to bringing incremental drinkers into the category. And you'll see us continue to make bold moves like we have with the economic strategy, we've got the full craft partners and we've recently signed those agreements with Sol and with Arnold Palmer Spiked.","So, June was a rough month from an industry point of view but that's all it was. It was one month and I'm optimistic about what's ahead for MillerCoors in the industry and I'm confident the industry is going to come together and focus on what's really important for us, which is the quality of our beers and the consumers that enjoy them.","From a second part of your question, we're not raising a fundamental deceleration of pricing overall in the U.S. There's always some level of promotional activity in \u2013 during summer and 2017 is no different. If you look at it over a longer timeframe, our full year 2016 net pricing growth, it's actually slightly higher than our full year of 2015. So, no real fundamental deceleration.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Gavin. Thanks, Vivien. And, Vivien, thanks for your feedback as well on the financial release. That's much appreciated.","Operator","The next question will come from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning and I also echo Vivien's comment about the release being much cleaner here, so thank you for that. So, Tracey, I guess I just wanted to clarify your free cash flow guidance. So, it's obviously unchanged, but there is additional $200 million of pension contribution. You talked about the first half coming in better than you expected from a cash generation standpoint. So, can you just talk about what's driving and sort of \u2013 or these improvements kind of sustainable as we go into 2018 and 2019?","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. Hi, Judy. So, just a couple of things. As I've said before, my priority is to generate free cash flow as quickly as possible, so that we can deleverage, and we've made that commitment to the rating agencies to be around four times by the end of 2018. So, U.S., I mean, we are generating stronger free cash flow and that has allowed us to make this incremental contribution to our U.S. pension plan. So, that is the U.S. pension plan. So I do want to remind you that pension contributions are deductible for tax. That $200 million in gross. You would need to tax effect that to get the net number.","And then, the other part that goes in to our free cash flow is obviously our working capital and the timing of working capital does play into the guidance that we've given of the $1.2 billion, plus or minus 10%. And in terms of looking forward to 2018, we're not ready to give guidance here for 2018. We will do that early in 2018 to help with that.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And, Tracey, can you maybe just update on kind of the improvement or stuffs that you've seen on the cost savings front? You talked about the $175 million plus for the full year. Can you at least tell us if you've gotten about halfway of this already? And as you've kind of implemented some of the plans, what have you been seeing in terms of perhaps further opportunities to unlock some of the cost savings going forward?","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. So, Judy, look, we \u2013 our cost savings and synergy plans are on track. And so, we are pleased that we are delivering the cost savings. We have, as you rightly mentioned, we've said that for 2017, it is going to be more than the $175 million. However, we are not breaking that up quarter-by-quarter because that number does fluctuate and this is for the full year, it will be more than $175 million and we are very pleased with our plan so far to deliver the $550 million over the three years.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Judy, it's Mark. Just to give you a little bit more color on that. I mean, if you look at the constituent parts, the cost savings program. So, really solid progress on our global procurement, that's integrating and as we push into that, clearly, some things we're looking to try and accelerate. We're pushing harder into some of the retail (32:43) opportunities that we didn't have the visibility to as we went through due diligence ahead of the deal closing.","North American supply chain, we've now started to move some volume, announced we're moving some volume from the U.S. up into Canada. And our global shared service initiative is very much on track. Leadership team is in place. Our shared service center in Romania is up and running and performing strongly. And I feel very good about how that is developing and we'll really start to, I think, deliver ongoing savings as we get to the end of 2018 and into 2019. IT integration is performing strongly and our global commercial group is really coming together powerfully as well. So, literally, six months to nine months post-closing, I would say, very, very solid progress on all fronts.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Steve Powers of UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up on free cash flow and pension for Tracey and then maybe a broader question Mark for you. First, Tracey, I think you had previously indicated that we should expect another $100 million plus being contributed against the pension next year and 2018 as well. So, in that context is this higher 2017 contribution a pull forward that would eliminate that need or should we still expect an incremental $100 million, $120 million as a use of cash in 2018?","And then Mark, broader question. I think, it's fair to say that there was a good deal of consternation coming out of the June Analyst Day specifically around the 30 basis points to 60 basis points of annualized EBITDA margin expansion that you expect going forward.","And I guess I'd just like to get your reaction to the concerns that arose, many of which I'm sure you've heard. I mean, whether or not, you think they were rooted in any kind of misunderstandings that you might be able to clarify.","From my perspective, I think, many investors have been hoping that while the rate of EBITDA margin expansion that you guided to was maybe below Street expectations, that perhaps your EBITDA dollar expectations were more in line under the assumption that you've embedded more optimistic top line assumptions into your outlook.","And I'd just like to get a sense of, if you think that's fair, if you thought about providing further clarity maybe in the form of dollar-based EBITDA outlook, more color around the top line assumptions or anything else. And again, I'm just trying to get a sense for how you've reacted to the markets interpretation of your June messaging and whether it's impacted your thinking at all about how you may communicate going forward. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Steve. There was a lot in that \u2013 I think the first question on free cash flow and pension where that's going forward, do you want to pick up, Tracey?","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. So, hi, Steve. So, the additional contributions that we made is to the U.S. plan. So, it is pulling forward next year's contributions. We had an opportunity to do that. However, the U.S. isn't the only pension plan. So, I don't want to say that there won't be any further contributions to pension plans, but this one is a pull forward for the U.S. plans.","Having said that, there's a number of things that enter our decisions as to the amount to contribute to our pension plans, and one of those is market performance against our assets. So, depending on how the assets perform, will also tell us how much we need to contribute. And then just going forward, we're not going to give any contribution guidance at this stage, but we will do that again early next year, depending again as how our assets and our plan performs.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Thanks, Tracey. And then, Steve, just to your perspective coming out of the Analyst Day in June, I think, the messaging back to us was loud and clear. And clearly, we've had further discussions with our Board based on some of that feedback. I think we feel good about the guidance that we've offered. I think if there was any miss or disconnect that relates to the fact that our aspiration for our business is to improve the trajectory of our top line. And that top line plus our EBITDA margin expansion which I believe is measured and balanced over the medium term allows us to drive our bottom line EBITDA performance in a sustainable way.","And I think, in a number of conversations I've had with investors, I've clarified that \u2013 clearly, I will retain flexibility on the P&L if we believe that the top line isn't coming through because markets are softer or there's other factors, we'll retain the flexibility to protect their absolute profit performance. And that's what we've agreed with our Board. So, I think, if there's any message, maybe a lack of belief in our ability to get our top line moving. But I think you have seen certainly in our current quarter results that we are making that happen in many parts of our business. We're driving initiatives that are going to further premiumize our portfolio. And there's two been announced already in the U.S. We continue to work on others.","And we're seeing very, very strong volume growth, which is an impact to our total level in our international business, and I believe, there's a lot more to come there as well. So, our belief is that we'll deliver absolute profit growth and we'll do that with a balance of an improved top line delivery on our costs and synergy targets, but with flexibility retained on our P&L to protect that bottom line performance.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you both for the perspective on both those questions. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And it's actually a natural progression to the question you just answered, Mark, and it pertain specifically to Canada and your comments about premiumization surely apply there, and yet if we look at establishing revenue momentum in Canada it seems like it's a rather \u2013 it's been a rather elusive outcome. So, my question is still simply, number one, how impactful do you think having these Miller brands is to your capacity to achieve the momentum that really hasn't evidenced itself? And then, number two, if you think about spending, if you think about execution, you think incremental additions to your portfolio, what you currently lack in the high-end. What's still necessary to achieve in a structural sense the momentum that hasn't quite materialized in Canada?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Thanks, Mark. Let me offer a few headlines. If I miss anything, Fred, then let me know. Clearly the addition of the Miller brands back into the portfolio in Canada is meaningful and you've seen share growth now in Q1 and in Q2 which is very encouraging including the addition of those brands. And I believe there's more potential to come because it's certainly over the course of the last 12 months to 18 months, the brands weren't particularly well supported or focused on by the previous owners.","But we've seen share growth come through and we've seen consistent solid pricing growth come through in the first and second quarter. Unfortunately in the second quarter, industry was very soft in the months of May. So excluding May, we've actually been pretty much on track for our plan for this year. Premiumization of the portfolio is working very positively. You do have to remember clearly, a large part of that premiumization effort is in partner brands, so not all of the field margin flows through on our P&L.","But clearly the biggest kind of the driver of overall profit improvement will be improved performance in both Coors Light and Molson Canadian. They're such a large part of our portfolio. It's priority one, two, and three for Fred and the team. We've seen sequential improvements in our share performance, but clearly, we're still not satisfied with absolute volume numbers, and we're seeing some very encouraging pockets of improvement, particularly in the West, national accounts, LCBO, et cetera. But we've still got more work to do there. So I'm encouraged with the inputs. Still not satisfied with the outputs is probably how I would mark ourselves at this stage, Mark.","Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's great and helpful. And if I could follow up with you or Fred, what I'm hearing, Mark, is that you don't consider it primarily a question of increasing spending on the brands at a faster rate than inflation, say, for example, that it's not primarily a spending problem, although spending obviously has its place. But is that a fair characterization?","And then when you think about priorities other than one, two and three, namely the amount of products you have in the high end, do you think you need to be more aggressive buying craft brewers or doing other things to partner with other import entities, something to allow you to participate even more fully in the import and the high-end segment of Canada?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Actually, there were a lot of constituent parts to that question. I think if you look at the shape of our portfolio in above premium, I think we've got a very broad and deep portfolio. There's maybe one or two geographical gaps that Fred and the team are currently looking at, at the moment. But I think it's very much about just further improvement of momentum there and premiumization of the total portfolio. I mean, Fred, do you want to offer any color around that?","Frederic Landtmeters - Molson Coors Canada, Inc.","Yeah. Actually, thanks, Mark. Just maybe one thing to add, and I agree with the topics you raised. One thing to add to Mark's question is probably the performance we're recording in the Western part of the country. I think I am indeed very encouraged by the share growth we are enjoying. I am encouraged by the premiumization of the portfolio has translated into strong NSR per hectoliter growth.","In the Western part of the country, there's a number of provinces where the momentum has already translated in absolute volume growth in Q2 and on a year-to-date basis. And that's what is actually encouraging me to think that we can win the top line battle going forward, and we're keeping our focus on it.","From a spending perspective, I'm confident that we have the right amount of spend in place. I think it was mentioned before that we're trying to increase the effectiveness of our spend, so that's definitely high on our agenda. But I think we're pulling the right levers in my view, and ultimately I'm confident that that is going to pay off.","Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you. Very helpful.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Mark, just to add maybe two more comments on that front, because I think this is important, that there's no expectation that we need to step up our spend in Canada. If anything, we want to drive further effectiveness on our spend, and we've taken the return on marketing investment model from the U.S. into Canada, and that's starting to throw up some very interesting opportunities for us to drive further efficiency. We've got a major initiative now up and running with a new resource in Qu\u00e9bec in particular around our trade promotional investment, and again that's starting to really, I think, pay dividends.","We've taken Building with Beer from the U.S. and have launched that in Canada as well, which drives executional effectiveness at the front-end of the business. And I think I mentioned last year that Sergey Yeskov who was our GM and President for our business in Croatia and Bosnia is now leading the whole of our sales force. And I'm delighted with the progress that Sergey is making again driving much enhanced sales execution at the front-end of the business.","So it's still early days but very encouraged by the combination of both front-end execution and just the way that Fred's leading the business around kind of prioritization and spend effectiveness.","Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Super helpful. Thank you, gentlemen.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Frederic Landtmeters - Molson Coors Canada, Inc.","Good morning, Bryan.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hey, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I have a question related to the plans to build a new brewery in Montr\u00e9al. And I guess a couple questions related to it. First, I think in the press there was like a $500 million number that was being reported on in terms of the investment. I'm not sure if you've actually said yet how much you think it would cost. So some perspective on that. Whether or not the build-out will be included in sort of normal CapEx or if we'll end up with an elevated CapEx level related to it? And then finally in terms of the cost savings related to that brewery, is that inside the $550 million or would that be above and beyond the current $550 million savings plan?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. So let me pick that up specifically, Bryan. So, firstly, the cost savings number is not in the $550 million because the brewery build-out is beyond the guidance we've given around 2017 to 2019. So that will be included in our next three-year cost-saving cycle, so more to come on that. Our assumption is it's included within our current free cash flow and CapEx guidance going forward. So we'll manage that within our existing envelope.","And the way to think about the Montr\u00e9al brewery build-out, and clearly this is something we looked at in a lot of detail. We have two options. One was to develop a brownfield site on our existing site \u2013 and I'm not going to give you specific numbers, but let's just say that was hundreds of millions of dollars \u2013 are building a greenfield site, which again is hundreds of millions of dollars. The greenfield site drives significantly enhanced productivity and cost savings numbers versus trying to build out a greenfield. So far a relatively small incremental investment. We get a significant return that pays back very quickly because of the ongoing cost savings.","And certainly from a pack perspective, it makes an awful lot of sense for us. And I think once we are into further conversations and communication with our employees and confirmation of the exact site, we can give you a little bit more detail. But hopefully that deals with the three parts of your question.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's very helpful. And just in terms of the existing \u2013 the property that you own today ...","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yes.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","...will it be similar to Vancouver where you could potentially sell it to fund or have you made plans yet with that property?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","It will be similar in terms of selling to \u2013 unfortunately the real estate market in Qu\u00e9bec isn't quite as hot as the real estate market in (48:18) Vancouver. So I wish it was, but clearly that site will help offset some of the cost, and the intention is to retain a heritage and brew pub vehicle or presence on that site as well just to underpin our legacy in Montr\u00e9al and Qu\u00e9bec.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks for the perspective.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","And next we have a question from Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Thank you very much, and nice quarter and a very, very helpful conference call so far. Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us \u2013 you touched on a little bit in the beginning but a little bit more detail on how Coors Light is doing outside of the U.S. in aggregate. I think you gave us a Latin American number, but how is it doing in general? And also Miller Lite, that brand I think you had alluded to had not gone perhaps as much support over the last couple of years. How that is starting to come along and a little bit more detail on the transition to your system and partners, please.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. So, thanks, Robert. Thanks for your comments. Let me ask both Simon and Stewart to comment on this. So, obviously, Coors Light in UK and Ireland is a big brand. Simon, do you want to just offer a couple of headlines around the Coors Light performance and MCE? And then, Stewart, do you want to pick up on Coors and Miller transition for MCI?","Simon Cox - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yes. Thank you, Mark. So, as Mark stated, the Coors Light brand in Europe is really predominantly a UK and Ireland brand. And frankly, it continues to perform very well. We're investing behind, as you know, premiumizing our portfolio. That's working very sell. Coors Light is a big part of it. And once again, Coors Light showed double-digit growth in the UK and Ireland. So a brand with real momentum that we're very pleased with, we're going to continue to invest behind, and those investments are really paying off for us.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. And I think in scale terms, Simon, we'll be roughly what kind of size now for Coors Light?","Simon Cox - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. MAT will be something like 1.3 million hectoliters now, Mark, and obviously continuing to grow strongly. So very positive.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Thanks, Simon. Stewart, do you want to pick up on progress in international markets?","Stewart F. Glendinning - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yes. So, Robert, thanks for the questions. So, first of all, your question relative to the transitions, as Mark mentioned in the call, they've been going very well. We're almost all of the TSAs now and having the brands both \u2013 well, Miller in our own hands is going to allow us to drive the brands much more aggressively. We're certainly seeing improvement on Miller where we have taken over the brands. There are a number of markets, as we mentioned, which we think didn't receive the attention, but they're getting our full attention now and we think we've got an excellent platform.","One thing to note is that both on MGD and Miller Lite, we will see new global campaigns coming out on those brands, and specific to Miller Lite, we'll be rolling out the white cans globally, and I think that's going to make a big impact on the brand.","With respect to Coors Light, the brand has been growing partly, including in Puerto Rico, even though the market is struggling as an industry. We grew share in the market broadly across Latin America. We were up high-single digits. And I think most importantly actually is that Miller itself has opened up a number of markets where Coors Light is not currently being sold, and that will give us the opportunity to expand Coors Light even faster.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Great. And then as a follow up, just kind of going back to Europe, it looked like you did very well there, but the results are a little bit confusing because there's a lot of moving parts. Could you talk about kind of the \u2013 if you will, the organic growth in Europe as much as you can in terms on an apples-to-apples basis?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. So the confusion comes from my desire to ensure that we've gotten kind of pan-European approach, so bear with us as we go through this year, Robert. But, Simon, do you want to kind of deconstruct that as best you can to give a better sense of the underlying strength of the business?","Simon Cox - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. I guess the concern with the results could be that is it all coming from things that we've transferred in. So Miller brands or the exports and license brands in all MCI. And that, of course, does play a positive role in the numbers. But to give you some real reassurance. If you strip that away, we would still have good volume growth on the underlying and core business through both our core brands and growth in our premium brands. We would still have positive pricing, and we would still have positive mix.","So the underlying business has pulled the hat trick this quarter with volume, pricing, and mix, and I think any quarter that we do that in Europe would be a very strong quarter. I think particularly pleasing is where we're putting our marketing investments, particularly behind premiumizing the portfolio on the existing business that's working. So Staropramen has great momentum; frankly, more or less across every country that we're putting it into Europe, and we've unified the visual identity of Staropramen in the Czech Republic and internationally, which helps us really market that brand efficiently and consistently.","We talked about Coors Light, which continues to be a star for us. Blue Moon, we're really starting to see that accelerate, particularly in UK and Ireland, and our craft volumes continue to perform well. So just to give you some reassurance, if you strip away some of the tailwinds that we get through the acquisition and the transfer in, we still had a very solid performance underlying. And all those inputs have led to \u2013 if you strip away currency, a 21% increase in EBITDA. So, overall, I would say a very, very strong performance in Europe, both supported by some of the transfers in, but more importantly a very strong performance in the underlying business also.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","So organic growth low-single digit, mid-single digit, can you give us a sense, please?","Simon Cox - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. I don't want to disaggregate too much, but we've been between those two numbers, something like that.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you very much.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","That's a great answer, Simon. Okay. Thanks, Robert.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning, guys. A couple of questions.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Good morning.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","This quarter, we saw two license agreements in the U.S. you alluded to. Just wondering is this somehow a broader strategy to broaden your portfolio assuming this will end up being lower margins since your licensed?","And then kind of a follow-up to a comment you made in terms of having higher distributor inventories leading to meaningful reductions in out of stock. So, I guess, the question is why not keep those higher along peak periods, assume that the returns are pretty positive given lost sales from out of stocks? So, if you can get into those, I'd appreciate it. Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. So, Gavin, do you want to think about the second question, and then I'll answer the first questions. So, on the first in terms of license agreement, to be fair, Brett, if you look at our business, we've got a long history of partnering to ensure that we've got a broad and deep portfolio and whether that's with companies like Heineken or Carlsberg or some independent companies we've attempted to ensure that in the markets that we compete in, we're offering the right portfolio from a consumer and a customer perspective. I've called out and as a leadership team we're leading for the premiumization of our portfolio. And we think about that across three fronts we describe as build, buy or borrow. So building would be creating something new, probably a great example of that would be Redd's in our portfolio which didn't exist three years or four years ago, and is a big brand.","Buying is the number of acquisitions that we've made, craft acquisitions and\/or setting up license arrangements and things like Sol and AriZona into that grouping. And then the third area is around borrowing. So I mentioned in my script, for example, we'll be taking Miller High Life into Canada from the U.S. and we've got other examples as we've moved our brands around the world.","So, that's how we think about building out our portfolio. We are pretty flexible. Clearly, when we do set up with the license agreement or a partnership, we do have to share the margin. But I'd rather share the margin and add to a margin as opposed to not compete in some parts of the industry, and I think that's working effectively for us. And we're working hard to building out the portfolio in all of our markets, and hopefully there'll be other initiatives to talk to you and the investors about in due course. So, more to come on that front, but I think good progress so far.","And then, Gavin, do you want to talk about distributor inventories and then perhaps in out-of-stocks?","Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Sure, Mark. Thanks. And, Brett, yes, you're absolutely right and we are doing that. So, if you look at the fact that we came into this year with higher distributor inventories at the end of December that was to make sure that we improved our performance in this sort of January timeframe, which has traditionally been a bit of a difficult month for us because of our start-up of the breweries coming out of the seasonal festivities, and that worked well for us, and out-of-stocks reduced meaningfully there. And we do it when we head into Memorial Day. This one obviously had an impact because it crossed over a quarter with the timing of July, the 4th. We've also introduced safety stocks of some of our faster-moving SKUs. And overall, I think, you will see a \u2013 and there has been a meaningful improvement in our service levels to our distributors.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great. Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Gavin. Thanks, Brett. I think, there's a couple more questions hope to come through.","Operator","Yes. Our next question comes from Chris Pitcher of Redburn.","Christopher Michael Pitcher - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Thank you very much for taking the question. A couple of follow-up questions on Europe. I know, you've said specifically that the underlying business had a strong quarter. But looking at the development in revenue per hectoliter it does look like there was a good sequential improvement Q2 into Q1. I was wondering if it's possible to talk a bit more in detail about that. Any particular markets where you're seeing pricing improving?","And then, secondly, you mentioned timing of marketing spend. Can I confirm that was a shift from Q2 into Q1 or should we expect a further pickup in marketing for the balance of the year in Europe?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. So, Simon, did you manage to get both those questions? Do you want to take both of them?","Simon Cox - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. I'm having a good day. Yeah. So, in terms of pricing and mix, so as you've seen in our release, our NSR per hectoliter was up 3.7%. That was more driven by mix than by pricing. So, pricing was about 0.3% and mix was 3.4%. And what we're trying to do in Europe and this is obviously not unique, we try and make sure that we have a good balance between our volume growth, our pricing growth and our mix, and we try and make sure those three levers are in fairly good calibration. And if we can get all three moving at the same time, then we would really regard that as a very positive quarter.","I'd like a little bit more on pricing, but the environment isn't always allowing us to do that, and therefore I think our volume result being as it is and our mix result being as it is gives us actually a very strong underlying revenue growth story. And it's premiumization that's really helping us do that. So, without wanting to be too repetitive, it's really the investments that we're putting behind Staropramen which has a premiumizing effect on our revenue, it's Coors Light in the UK and then it's our Blue Moon and craft portfolio and then some other investments that we're putting behind our Central European premiumization program. So, that's the main drivers of that.","In terms of marketing spend, if you look at our long-term history, we've been increasing marketing spend year-on-year since we made the StarBev acquisition in 2012, and that's what's been driving a lot of our positive results. Quarter-by-quarter, we'll always going to get a little bit of volatility. So, I don't want to give you too much of a steer on that quarter-by-quarter because I just don't think that's necessarily helpful.","We did spend more in Q1 and we did spend a little less in Q2. That's not necessarily anything systemic. We want to invest where it's most effective. And our view this year is we just needed to move some of those programs around, and particularly get off to a good start by investing more in Q1.","But generally speaking, it's the same answer you've got from Canada or in America that timings may vary from quarter-to-quarter. But overall, we're just trying to make sure that we're efficient in terms of our investments. And I think if you look at our outputs, again, volume, price, and mix, then our marketing investments are working very well for us. But you will see a little bit of variability quarter-to-quarter and I wouldn't read too much into it.","Christopher Michael Pitcher - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","So, I'm not wanting to hog the call. But \u2013 and forgive me if you've been gone through this in detail before, but in terms of the Punch transaction that's pending, have you given ever the percentage of your volume which goes through the Punch A states previously?","Simon Cox - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. I mean, we \u2013 no, we haven't and we wouldn't intend to disclose that either. I mean, just to give you some context, there's over 100,000 licensed outlets in the UK on-trade of which Punch A represents less than 2%. So, we wouldn't be overly concerned about that. The other thing to notice is that obviously a large majority of that estate is the lease-intensive estates, where the ultimate decision makers on what gets put on the bar are the tenants and the licensees.","And whilst we would expect some of that to be influenced by Heineken's purchase, it's not the same as having a manager stays in our brands to compete very, very effectively in that sector of the marketplace. So, I'm not factoring that in significantly to our UK performers which continues to be very strong.","Christopher Michael Pitcher - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Thank you very much.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Chris. I think there's one or two more questions.","Operator","Yes. Our next question will come from Pablo Zuanic of SIG.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Good morning. I've got a couple of questions for Tracey and then for Gavin. So, Tracey, obviously EBIT margins for MillerCoors for six months up about 80 bps. Company in total, EBIT margins flat \u2013 EBITDA margins flat. MillerCoors very good 80 bps. So, the question is when you gave that guidance of 30 bps to 60 bps medium term total consolidated EBITDA margin expansion, was the assumption that there will be headwinds at some of the divisional level?","I mean, obviously, there's a jump in corporate overhead this year, but it's bolstered by year two, year three corporate overheads as a percentage of sales is stable. I'm assuming that Europe and MCI should contribute to margin expansion and Canada should not be a headwind. But I'm just trying to understand if you can give us some color where in terms of that algorithm. Because obviously MillerCoors is running at a faster pace than that.","And the second quarter for you, Tracey, if my numbers are right, your EBITDA margins comps in the second half at MillerCoors are a lot easier, if I can use that word, than in the first half. So, you should be able to run significantly better than the 80 bps expansion that you've shown in the first. So, that's for you. And in the meantime I'll just ask Gavin my questions also.","So, Gavin, I know the area...","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Pablo. Pablo, it's Mark. Let's just pause there so that we can deal with these one at a time.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. That's fine. Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","On the first, Gavin, do you want to just talk to the EBITDA margin progress in the U.S. and I think if you can maybe just reference the progress that we made coming out of 2016 and the progress we've made in 2017. And then I'll come back and ask Tracey just then to give a broader perspective on enterprise level and what we're trying to do from an EBITDA margin perspective.","So, Gavin, do you want to just talk about the progress that the U.S. team has been making on EBITDA margin expansion?","Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Sure. Yeah. I mean we actually came out of last year in Q4 quite strongly. So, I'm not totally sure I agree with you Pablo on the comps are going to be easier, Q4 was actually quite tough. And of course the focus that we're placing on Above Premium and shifting our portfolio and accelerating the Above Premium is obviously having a benefit as you saw in our mix benefits in the second quarter, Pablo. And of course we continue to focus on cost of goods sold, which is low single-digits in the quarter and from a guidance point of view. And Mark talked quite extensively about the work that we're doing on marketing spending and ROMI, and more effectively spending our money and the benefits of becoming part of a global procurement organization as to how we leverage the synergies and the agency cost.","So, that's what I would say on the margin, Mark.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. And I think as we've talked about in the past Pablo I mean we know exactly where the opportunities are in the U.S. We're chasing those down. We saw very good EBITDA margin expansion last year and that's continued into this year. But Tracey do you want to just give a broader perspective as we think from an enterprise perspective?","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. So, a couple of things maybe just to keep in mind. So, Gavin did mentioned the fourth quarter of last year for the U.S. Just to give a number around that, we're cycling in Q4 for MillerCoors, and a pre-tax income increase of 42%. So, that's a big headwind for us in Q4. The other thing just to mention is we \u2013 in Q3 we're cycling one more quarter of the Canada brand amortization. If you recall in Q4 of last year we reclassified some of our brands to definite lives. So, we've got one more quarter of that cycle in Q3. And then the other thing just to mention from a Canada point of view is the COGS per hectoliter last year in Q4 was actually a reduction, so recycling very positive performance in Q4 of last year.","And then another headwind just to consider is we do have the higher corporate cost as you mentioned. We are investing, for example, behind our global business services that we opened in May in Romania, and we're investing behind the shared service center that we'll be keeping in Milwaukee.","So, there is a couple of costs to consider for this year that we will be investing and also cycling some performance. And then, again, just to remind you, the 30 basis points to 60 basis points, we do look at that over a longer term, so three years to four years.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","So, I think...","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","So, yes.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, I think the only thing I would add, Pablo, is just connect that to my earlier comments that we've tried to, I think, deliver what we believe will be a measured and sustainable improvement and our overall EBITDA margins, and connect that with our aspiration and our plan to get our top line moving. So, those two things have got to work in tandem. So, hopefully I've given you some color around your first question. I think, your second question is (1:08:13).","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. Understood. Thank you very much for that. I'm sorry about the follow-up. So, it's more for Gavin I guess two questions. For two quarters in a row, your STRs have been two points to three points better than what is kind of data implied. And in the past, you had been the opposite, one point to two points worse. So, I assume that it means you are doing better in developing terms in liquor stores, independents and on premise. So, if you can comment on that.","And the second question just more in general. If you can give us an update in terms of what's happening in the mass retail channels, supermarkets in particular in terms of space allocation, has the beer space been reduced in absolute terms, or \u2013 and\/or is the space being managed in a different way by the retailers in terms of what they give to craft. If you can give us an update on that, that would be useful. Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Pablo. Gavin, over to you for both of those.","Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Mark. Thanks, Pablo. Look, yeah, hard for me to give you an answer as to why there's a different between what you're seeing in Nielsen and the other industry guys and what we're coming up with. What I can say to you is that on-premise volume trends continue to underperform relative to off-premise. And there's obviously a number of factors that are driving that lower foot traffic due to the economic impact and the economic environment. And frankly, the on-premise business has lost a relatively greater share to wine and hard liquors.","From a MillerCoors perspective in recent quarters, we've narrowed that gap with our on-premise volume trends actually improving and a big part of that is building with beer which is being well received by the retailers. And we're also taking that into C stores, liquor stores and grocery. So, that's what I would say on that.","As far as shelf space is concerned, obviously premium and economy segments are facing lots of challenges from a category headwind point of view, and from shelf spaces as well. But consumer interest in those segments remains really high, and it still represents 60% of the beer sold in the United States. So, from a retailer perspective, premium and economy priced lagers do remain the fastest moving brands in the industry, and they've proven to be profitable. So, reallocating shelf space to brands that have lower velocities like Mexican imports doesn't really make a whole lot of business sense. And we believe that all three price segments play an important role for the category, just as they do for wine and spirits, and we participate in all three of those segments.","So, taking away shelf space from premium and economy segment is not going to help grow the category, because as we saw with the economy drinker, when you ignore them, they just end up going to wine and spirits. So hope that answers your question.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Very helpful.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","I think, the only thing I would add to what Gavin said, and so spot on is that as we've seen the craft segment slowdown and many retailers actually focused on simplifying the crafts space within the context of the total beer space. And we've seen that already and I think you'll see more of that to come over the course of the next 12 months to 24 months. So, Pablo, thanks for your questions. I think, Laura, that's where we're wrapped on questions, is that correct?","Operator","That is correct. I was just going to turn it back over to you, Mr. Hunter.","Mark R.

Look, 2019 was a challenging year for Molson Coors Beverage Company. However, despite significant headwinds and continued volume declines, we grew net sales revenue per hectoliter and improved our mix. We delivered strong free cash flow and cost savings, reduced our debt and started making progress towards premiumizing and modernizing our portfolio.","We know there's still a lot of work to do. And that's why last quarter, we announced the plan to get Molson Coors back to consistent top line growth. Plan is designed to streamline the company, allow us to move faster and to free up resources to invest in our brands and capabilities. And as promised in October, we've wasted no time implementing the plan.","And to remind you, there are five components of the revitalization plan: investing in our iconic brands, aggressively growing our above-premium business in beer and in flavored beverages, growing beyond beer, strengthening our capabilities and streamlining our company. So let me update you on some of the progress that we're making.","We believe in the future of our core brands, because they have the power to recruit new legal-age drinkers, which is why investing in our core is a key part of our revitalization plan. In the fourth quarter of 2019 in the United States, we released new creative pieces in the Coors Light Made to Chill campaign and the Miller Lite It's Miller Time campaign and we've already unveiled more spots in 2020 as well. The early results are positive.","Additionally, global Coors Light performance was flat, reflecting its best quarter in over three years and showing improvement in each of our segments. Miller Lite grew in all segments, delivering high double-digit growth in Canada and had its best quarter in the United States since 2014. As we work to aggressively grow our Above Premium business, we see progress in our Above Premium beer and in Above Premium flavored beverages. Volume and NSR improved for the full year 2019 in Above Premium with an acceleration in Q4. We will support this acceleration by providing more fuel to our fastest-growing brands and new innovations in the Above Premium space.","Last month we launched new creative for Peroni in the United States which grew strong double-digits in 2019 and presents a real opportunity for us in 2020. Belgian Moon continues to be one of our biggest success stories in Canada, growing strong double-digits in both the quarter and the year and delivering its third consecutive year of growth. And Staropramen, our check lager celebrated its 150th anniversaries with volumes up high single-digits on the year with strong momentum heading into 2020 as Q4 volume and revenue grew double-digits.","We have launched two big bet innovations in the United States already with Blue Moon Light Sky and Saint Archer Gold. Light Sky is a low-calorie low-carb beer brewed with tangerine peel. It's a great product that pushes the Blue Moon brand into incremental occasions and consumers.","Saint Archer Gold is a premium light lager that offers a better-tasting alternative to Michelob Ultra as proven by independent expert beer panel. We introduced consumers to Saint Archer Gold with a broad media campaign that kicked off during the professional football championship game and showcases how the brand is the better-tasting light beer.","Our Jensen Blake portfolio again outperformed the U.S. craft market in 2019 growing 16% per AC Nielsen versus a flat craft market. In January, we agreed to acquire Atwater Brewery, a regional craft brewer in Michigan. It fills a geographic void, gives us the still spirits capability, and will help position our craft portfolio to continue outperforming the broader craft market.","We're investing more in flavored malt beverage and whitespaces that differentiate us and allow us to reach more consumers. Building on our 2019 successes, in the United States, we will continue to invest behind Cape Line sparkling cocktails which were Nielsen top 10 growth brand for 14 consecutive weeks in 2019. And we're expanding La Colombe hard coffee to additional markets.","In Canada, we will continue to invest in Mad Jack, popular FMB that was up double-digits on the year. And next month, we will launch Vizzy in the United States, a hard seltzer that offers differentiated ingredients which would help it carve out a meaningful space in the seltzer category.","And lastly, we're expanding beyond the beer altogether. This is a big shift, but it presents real growth opportunities. In November, we announced an equity deal a long-term partnership with L.A. Libations, an incubator of better-for-you non-alcoholic beverages. This investment essentially creates a new non-alcoholic innovation team for the Molson Coors Beverage something -- something that we simply did not have before.","Now, I want to be clear we are not looking to compete in the soda aisle with Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola. And stable we're selective about where we compete, always looking to leverage our unique strengths.","Then, of course, next month we're taking a definitive step into the wine category with a national launch of Movo wine spritzers in the United States. The organizational restructuring is well underway and we are making progress towards our goal of improving efficiency and unlocking an additional $150 million in annual savings bringing our total expected cost savings to $600 million over the 2020 through 2022 program. We have simplified our structure from four business units and a corporate center to two streamlined units; North America and Europe.","In North America, our new organizational design is now set. All teams have been selected and people are transitioning to new office locations. In Europe, we have announced all senior leadership changes and anticipate completing the reorganization by the end of March.","As part of our updated structure we have a new data and analytics team and are expanding and developing new commercial and operational capabilities that will make us smarter and more efficient. We continue to estimate the cost of all these changes will result in total one-time charges in the range of approximately $120 million to $180 million spread over Q4 of last year 2020 and 2021.","Next quarter we will report our financials under our new operating structure. As you can see we are moving quickly to implement our plans and we're starting to see glimpses of transformation within our portfolio. Also the new structure is already providing greater clarity and accountability. Teamwork has improved and the speed of decision making is substantially quicker. None of this is easy and it won't happen overnight. But the tough decisions we've made and the quick actions and investments we are making will ensure the Molson Coors Beverage Company is built to succeed in today's marketplace.","And now I'm going to hand over to Tracey for a review of the fourth quarter and full year as well as our outlook. Tracey?","Tracey Joubert","Thank you, Gavin and hello everyone. I will first cover the quarter and full year on a consolidated and regional basis and then move on to our outlook. So to recap the quarter, net sales revenue increased 3% in constant currency. We delivered positive global pricing and mix as well as a 1% increase in financial volume including a planned benefit in the U.S. from shipments exceeding brand volume as full year shipment volumes and retail volumes converged.","Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 1.1% in constant currency, reflecting continued favorable global pricing and mix. Our Europe business continues to deliver strong in sales hectoliter increases, driven by both pricing and mix.","In North America we saw a sequentially lower increase in our U.S. business and slightly lower rates in Canada. Remember general price increases have largely shifted from the fall to the spring in the U.S. with the most recent increase last spring.","Our U.S. mix benefit was neutral in the quarter. Worldwide brand volume decreased 1% and financial volume increased 1%, reflecting a planned benefit in the U.S. as we shipped largely to consumption for the full year. Global priority brand volume increased 1.6%. In the U.S., brand volumes benefited from improving industry volumes.","October 2018 was soft, following a general price increase and improving premium last segment trends as you heard in Gavin's remarks. Canadian volumes remained challenged in the fourth quarter, driven in part by continued industry softness.","In Europe, our brand volume benefited from a broad-based improvement in industry trends and continued premiumization. Our international business brand volumes grew double digits, driven by strong performance in Latin America.","Underlying cost per hectoliter increased 1.7% on a constant currency basis driven by inflation and mix and partially offset by cost savings. The trend was significantly improved versus prior quarters, primarily reflecting fixed cost absorption in our U.S. business resulting from shipment timing between quarters and the stacking of one-time costs in our Canadian business from 2018.","Underlying MG&A decreased 6.3% on a constant currency basis, due to a non-recurring vendor benefit in the U.S. and lower one-time incentive compensation expenses driven by the anticipated departures as a result of the revitalization plan. These items together account for approximately 50% of the reduction in MG&A.","Additionally, our marketing spend was lower in the fourth quarter, reflecting a planned shift of spending to support brand launches earlier in the year and align our marketing pressure with the key selling seasons, particularly within Europe and the U.S. As a result, underlying EBITDA increased 15.8% on a constant currency basis.","Recapping the year, net sales revenue decreased 0.6% in constant currency. We delivered positive global pricing and mix but this was offset by a decline in global volume. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 2.9% in constant currency, driven by favorable pricing and mix as we continue to focus on premiumizing our portfolio. Worldwide brand volume decreased 3.5% and financial volume decreased 4%. Global priority brand volume decreased 2.2%.","Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased mid-single digits, up 4.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by inflation mix and volume deleverage, partially offset by cost savings. Underlying MG&A decreased 0.9% on a constant currency basis. Corporate underlying MG&A was $150 million \u2013 $158 million coming in below prior year and below our prior estimates, driven largely by lower incentive compensation expense and other targeted spending reductions. Marketing spend per hectoliter was up for the year in each of our segments.","As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 2.6% on a constant currency basis. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $827 million in line with prior year results but below our prior estimates driven by later and lower-than-planned capital expenditures. Net interest expense of $273 million was in line with our third quarter estimate.","We delivered underlying free cash flow of $1.370 million in line with our estimates and 3.7% below the prior year, driven by lower underlying EBITDA and higher cash tax payments, partially offset by lower capital expenditures, favorable changes in working capital and lower cash interest payments.","Capital expenditures of $593 million were lower than our prior estimate driven by savings and the timing of capital spending as we evaluated and made capital decisions to drive stronger returns. In 2019, we completed our three-year savings program associated with the MillerCoors acquisition and integration, delivering $230 million during 2019 and brining our three-year total savings to $725 million. Cost to capture the savings over the three years were $208 million coming in at the low end of our most recent estimate of $230 million, driven by the addition and delivery of high-value low-cost projects.","So this takes me to our financial outlook. We expect 2020 to be a transition year and anticipate net sales revenue to be flat to down low single digits on a constant currency basis. We expect underlying EBITDA to be down high single digits on a constant currency basis from fiscal year 2019 underlying EBITDA of $2.364 billion.","Our estimated underlying effective tax rate is 20% to 24%. We expect interest expense of $280 million plus or minus 5%. And we expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $850 million. We estimate capital spending of $700 million plus or minus 10%; and underlying free cash flow of $1.1 billion plus or minus 10% reflecting lower expected EBITDA performance, as well as higher cash taxes than in 2019.","And as mentioned on our Q3 earnings call, we increased our total cost savings program for the period 2020 through 2022 to $600 million as a result of the revitalization plan to be spread more evenly over that period. Now as a reminder we are planning to reinvest these additional cost savings behind our brands and other capability-building.","With the exception of costs that would qualify for special items treatment all other costs to achieve the $600 million in savings are included within our underlying EBIT guidance. Examples of special items included in the $120 million to $180 million of cost to achieve are severance, retention and relocation costs associated with the revitalization plan.","Accelerated depreciation and other direct costs associated with the Urbandale Brewery closure will also be reported as special items. We expect 2021 and thereafter to deliver net sales revenue and underlying EBITDA growth versus 2020.","We intend to maintain our investment grade credit rating. And as our full year 2019 trailing annual underlying EBITDA has our current annualized dividend within our target range of 20% to 25%, we do not anticipate the Board of Directors will change our dividend rate at this time.","The change in structure to two business units went into effect at the start of the year. Therefore the resulting financial reporting changes will be reflected in our first quarter 2020 results including allocation of corporate MG&A expense to our two business segments.","Now also please consider the following related items. Our estimate of 2020 EBITDA is unchanged versus our estimate on October 30, 2019 in spite of a strong fourth quarter benefiting from onetime items shipment timing and the food spending as we refined our revitalization plan.","Our business continues to face a number of headwinds including inflation. And we are committed to investing to improve our top line performance. While we expect the full year's underlying EBITDA to be down high single digits on a constant currency basis, we expect the second half EBITDA to be better than the first half for two main reasons.","Our full year increase in marketing investments will begin in half one, as we launch new products and add support to our premium brands and the cost savings that we expect to realize in 2020 will be skewed to the back half of that year.","In January we announced the decision to close our Urbandale Brewery. The associated cost savings are not considered part of the revitalization plan, but are included in the previously announced $600 million cost-savings program for 2020 to 2022.","Now with that thank you for your time and attention and I'll turn it back to Andrea for Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Serotta of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Eric Serotta","Good morning. Gavin, hoping you could give us a little bit of color on the seltzer and beyond beer strategy. Seems like you're taking a very different path than some of your competitors in not extending your core brands. Is there any thought to a Coors Light seltzer or Miller Lite seltzer? And what are you hearing from retailers and distributors, in terms of initial response to what you're showing them for Vizzy?","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks. Good morning, Eric. Look, we believe that the seltzer category is here to stay. Let's be clear about that. And Molson Coors plans to compete in this space aggressively. And we are going to have a multi-pronged approach to attacking that space. Having said that, the key premise with our approach is to drive incrementality by being a very clear point of difference to that of the competition.","And as you referenced, this year we are introducing Vizzy which we think does have clear points of difference with the competition. It will be the first-type seltzer made with acerola cherry, which is a super fruit higher in the antioxidant, vitamin C. And there's no reason to believe that this isn't going to resonate very well with consumers and particularly that 25 to 39-year-old male and female that choose to drink, but are looking for potentially better choices.","I'm not going to get into details of how much exactly that we're investing, but we've got a very robust campaign that launches around the same time as Vizzy hits the shelf. It's going to include national TV. It will have digital, social, out-of-home advertising and a very strong sampling effort.","This is going to be our biggest bid yet on the hard seltzer segment, which we think will reach a couple of billion dollars in sales this year. As far as the response from our distributors and retail is concerned, we've had an excellent response. There is a lot of excitement and anticipation for this brand. So we're excited about it.","Eric Serotta","And just to follow up on that, would you rule out -- you talked about a multipronged approach. Would you -- and you have Henry's in the market, but would you rule out doing something with one of your core beer brands? I know you've gone down that road in the past with things like Coors Light Summer Brew, but decided to stick true to the core product and messaging. Is that something that's on the table or something that you'd rule out?","Gavin Hattersley","Look, I think, Eric, just reiterating what I said, right, is we think that we need to have a clear point of differentiation to our competition. And where we find a clear point of differentiation, we will drive into that in a meaningful way. Our current is Vizzy, which is what we're going to put a lot of time and effort behind it.","Eric Serotta","Great. Thanks so much, Gavin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Gavin Hattersley","Good morning, Bryan.","Tracey Joubert","Hey, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","So, I guess, Gavin, I want to touch on just kind of the state of Coors Light. Now that you've had the new ad copy in the U.S. on air for a few months now and you've kind of gone through this process now of kind of featuring your plants the retailers selling in for the summer season. So, could you just give us a little bit more color about how you feel about not just how the copy has resonated with consumers and for the brand, but also just as you're kind of teeing up merchandising for the summer months, do you feel like you're getting a little bit more reaction or support from your wholesalers and retailers behind the Coors Light brand?","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks Bryan. I mean the short answer is yes. We're getting a lot of support, a lot of excitement behind Coors Light from our network. Certainly the most -- since I've been in this chair and when I was in the MillerCoors as well. The MillerCoors platform is stronger. Results are strong. The brand achieved its best quarterly STR trends since the first quarter of 2017.","It accelerated segment share gains in the fourth quarter behind the new creative and we're going to invest meaningfully behind this platform in 2020. It's brought relevance back to the brand again. It's back in the lives of new legal-drinking-age consumers, its back in the cultural landscape, and its momentum is heading in the right direction Bryan. And we're just getting started. But the short answer to your question is yes; our wholesalers are very excited about it.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Steve Powers","Yes, great. Thanks. Tracey could you talk a little bit more about the targeted spend priorities for 2020? And just clarify maybe confirmed that the cadence of those investments specifically on the MG&A line will more or less mirror 2019. I think that's what I heard but I just wanted to clarify.","And then relatedly Gavin I guess for you what does success look like in terms of a topline response or maybe a market share response this year on the back of all of the planned initiatives that you outlined versus to what degree may it take until 2021 or beyond for these 2020 investments to show more of a cumulative return? Thanks.","Gavin Hattersley","Yes. Thanks. Great. Thanks Steve. Look Tracey you can maybe take some of the G&A side. I'll just talk about marketing. From a marketing perspective, we've got a lot of innovation and new news coming in the first half of this year Steve. So, you can expect our marketing spend to be up-weighted in the first half versus the second half.","And as you -- I mean I know Tracy has given full year guidance on EBITDA and we're not going to give quarterly guidance. But I think just directionally we're going to spend more in the first half than we will in the second half. We've already launched two big innovations Saint Archer Gold and Blue Moon Light Sky and we've got two more big ones coming with Vizzy and with the national expansion of Movo.","Obviously, innovation takes a lot of work and a lot of effort and a lot of investment and you don't necessarily get a significant uplift on day one. And so we don't necessarily expect that. But we do expect improvement in our Above Premium portfolio through these innovations.","A success for me looks like what I've really said right, which is we do expect us to be sort of flat to down low single-digits from a net sales revenue point of view. But we believe everything that we're doing in 2020 is setting ourselves up for sustainable growth in NSR in 2021 and beyond. Tracey from a G&A point of view?","Tracey Joubert","Yes. So just maybe to reiterate what I said in the script from a G&A, I mean we are -- the G&A spend is basically in the EBITDA guidance that we've given. A couple of things to think about as we look at half year one and half year two. First of all as Gavin mentioned our marketing spend is going to be up. That will be sort of weighted more to the first half of the year as we invest behind our new product launches and support our premium brands.","And then from the cost-savings side that's going to be skewed more to the back half of the year and as we realize the savings related to the revitalization plan. And again the revitalization plan savings will be primarily in the G&A area.","Steve Powers","Okay. Thank you very much for that. I guess Gavin just to follow-up on the definition of success question. There's just -- there\u2019s a ton of new products from yourselves, from competitors in the beer space hitting the market right now. It's going to be a lot of shifts on shelf and within coolers. Is your feel in aggregate that you're going to hold cumulative shelf and cooler space in 2020 versus 2019, or do you expect to gain or maybe shed some of that? Just how are you thinking about that? Thank you.","Gavin Hattersley","Yeah. Look I mean I would be disappointed if we didn't increase our shelf space. I do think though that there's going to be movements within that. So, in large format I think you'll see some of the slow-moving lines in craft and seltzers and some of the adjacencies like FMBs and sides. We'll probably take some losses to create new space for a lot of these innovations that are coming particularly the growth of seltzer.","I mean initial indications would appear that the biggest loss is taking place with craft, which the assortment of that has just expanded significantly over the past 15 years. I think in small format it's a little different. Seltzer is making aggressive inroads on distribution in both single-serves and multipack. And I would say more space is probably coming from economy as well as craft in less developed, which -- because craft is less developed than it is in large format.","But again the short answer to your question is, I'll be disappointed if we didn't increase our shelf space with some of the innovations that we're bringing. And certainly the indications from our retailers and our distributor partners is that that will hold true and will expand both.","Steve Powers","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrea Teixeira","Good morning. Thank you. So I wanted to -- should we step back into the organization of the two main regions between the U.S. and Europe? And is that a main strategy to give better visibility and empower the local teams, or could you potentially sell the business to fund M&A in seltzer, or you want just to grow greenfield in that category?","And just a clarification on Gavin's comments about Vizzy. So for Vizzy -- so you believe that -- which launches I believe last month. So you -- I think I heard you say that the brand can reach $1 billion in sales. And so if that's the case what is the time line? ","Gavin Hattersley","No. Sorry Andrea. You misunderstood me there. I said the -- what I meant to say was the seltzer category will get into the $1 billion as a category. I mean, I would be delighted if Vizzy did, but that's not what I said. I think the total category will be there.","As far as the two business units is concerned we're obviously setting the European and North American businesses up as stand-alone operations, because we believe that strong regional leadership will be able to make decisions much quicker. It will streamline decision-making. It will remove bureaucracy, which perhaps slowed us down. It'll certainly make us more nimble and quick. And it's a very short distance between folk that are asking for decisions and the actual decision-makers. So we think that having two separate stand-alone business units is going to make us much better as an organization, much stronger in both Europe and in North America.","So we're actually already seeing the signs of that, where we've been able to bring campaigns with some of our global brands to market, much quicker than we have in the past outside the Coors Light campaign in the United Kingdom as a fine example of that. So we're particularly excited about the nimbleness of this new structure will bring us.","Andrea Teixeira","And in terms of capital allocation going forward, if you can kind of elaborate more. How do you see the company like in five years?","Gavin Hattersley","Lot capital allocation is the critical decision that we make. But if you're asking me indirectly are we planning to sell Europe? The answer is no.","Andrea Teixeira","Yes. I guess exactly indirectly and directly. And then in M&A seltzers, you believe that the decision to just do the way the greenfield is the best decision at this point?","Gavin Hattersley","We're very excited about the multipronged approach that we're using to attack the seltzer space, Andrea. I think I said on our third quarter earnings call that we will have a string of pearls' approach to M&A. It's worked very well for us in the past and we've had many more successes with the small bolt-on acquisitions that give us capability and exposure to spaces that we haven't had. And if successful and we intend to continue along that path.","We really did that in the fourth quarter with the large but minority stake in Libations and we have an agreement to acquire Atwater in the \u2013 hopefully the first quarter of this year. That's an approach that's worked for us. It's worked for us very well in Europe with a number of success stories out there with Doom Bar and Aspall Cider and the repatriation of our Staropramen brand. So if it works for us, then we're going to continue driving on that path.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you, Gavin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to understand a little bit more about your EBIT guide for 2020. It looks like Coors Light and Miller Lite, at least sequentially you're showing some momentum. You've got considerable cost-savings strategy and benefit next year. And then, obviously, also, you have some, I guess, one-times in the G&A line this year from incentive comp and this vendor benefit. So why do you then expect for kind of a similar rate of decline of revenues to lead to quite a bit higher decline in EBITDA? I think this year you'll end at EBITDA down four on revenues down two, roughly. But for next year, you're looking at revenues maybe down two, but EBITDA, high single-digits with all of these things that seem to be going kind of moving in your favor next year? ","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks, Kaumil. Good morning to you. Look, 2020 is a transition year for us. It's going to take time to get the $150 million of savings out of the business. And we're implementing major actions that are fundamentally going to impact our portfolio, and many of these actions are going to take time for us to impact the top line.","I think I said earlier on, innovations take time to scale, and spending more money on marketing, doesn't necessarily have a day one positive impact. We believe that the changes that we're making now which are meaningful will set us up for success in 2021. We're also taking very seriously the industry trends that we're seeing in Canada and the impact that those trends are having on our overall business and the overall topline of our business.","We're obviously implementing the revitalization plan in Canada as well and we'll be investing more behind those brands. But you know -- Canada has been in decline for quite some time and it's not a trend that we're going to be able to reverse overnight, having said that, we're working very hard to do exactly that.","Q \u2013 Kaumil Gajrawala","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks, good morning everyone.","Gavin Hattersley","Good morning Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","Gavin, I wanted to come back to the investment question, maybe ask it little bit differently. So obviously, a lot of changes going on concurrently at the company, while a lot of investment is going into the portfolio, particularly in the first half of the year.","Can you give us a sense of how you're prioritizing these investments? Is this continued sequential improvement in Miller Lite and Coors Light do you have to establish some level of success in the hard seltzer category?","I'd say the market view on that front would be that -- the hard sell-through dynamic is a net negative for the company at this point, given some of the demand source from light beer category and the fact that the company has not really leaned in real heavily at this point. Maybe just give us a sense of the top three things, you really have the organization focused on in order to deliver what you've messaged to the street? Thank you.","Gavin Hattersley","Yes. Thanks Kevin. Look I mean, it's not an either\/or, right, it's a both end. We need to focus across our portfolio and we've been quite clear about the fact that our core brands in the United States, in Europe and in Canada remain a very important part of our business. And so we will increase the spend behind those brands going forward.","Having said that, the bulk of our increased spend will be in the above premium space. We need as I've said to fundamentally reshape our portfolio. We've done that successfully in the United Kingdom.","We're about 30% of the \u2013 of their portfolio is now in the above-premium space. And if I recall correctly Canada is at about 20%-odd. And obviously we've got a lot of ground to make up in the United States. And that's why most of our investment -- increased investment is going to be in the above-premium space and beyond beer in the U.S..","To that end, we launched Cape Line in 2019 which was a top share gainer in Nielsen for us, I think it was 14 straight weeks. We've introduced Sol Chelada. We're introducing Sol Lemon. I probably pronounced that incorrectly. We've got Belgian Moon up in Canada which grew strong double digits. In Europe, we've made progress and we'll continue to invest in above-premium.","I think I answered the seltzer question earlier on. There's not much more I can say to that other than that we're making a big bet behind Vizzy and we're very excited about how it's being received by retailers and distributors alike. We're expanding beyond the Bira with Movo.","I think the speed at which we are moving and the quantity of ideas that we're bringing to the marketplace has energized our network as -- I haven't seen it this way for quite some time. So we've obviously got a lot of work to do, but I'm pleased with the progress that we've seen across our portfolio. ","Kevin Grundy","That\u2019s great. Thanks again.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on innovation again. And I was curious, in particular, about Blue Moon Light Sky? I know it's quite early days, but turning around Blue Moon would take a -- be a pretty big step forward for the above-premium portfolio. So it's a little bit off season maybe to be launching or to have gotten that brand into market. But I'm just curious, on early reads from that, what you're kind of seeing the feedback on the taste profile? Does it bring Blue Moon users back or drinkers back into the category? Anything you could share there would be great. Thanks.","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks, Lauren. Look, Blue Moon -- just to start at the top. Blue Moon grew in 2019 globally. So very excited about that, just for starters. Secondly, we tested Blue Moon Light Sky extensively and consumers absolutely love the taste. It's a lighter, more sessionable beer that is going to really be complementary and provide a halo effect to Blue Moon Belgian White.","It's been in the marketplace for two weeks. The reception from our distributors has been very strong. Their orders are meaningfully higher than what we had anticipated and we're obviously working very hard to make as much Blue Moon Light Sky as we can. But I would caution you, Lauren. It's two weeks. But so far it's being extraordinarily well received.","Lauren Lieberman","And how might you rank order the potential impact of like a Vizzy versus a Blue Moon Light Sky for this year? Because you're, on the one hand, leveraging an existing and very strong brand; and the other very strong category, but new-to-world brand.","Gavin Hattersley","Yes. That's a great question. And, obviously, I'm excited about all our innovation. And I'm not going to handicap which one is going to turn out to be the best this year, Lauren. Time will obviously tell. But each of them are unique in their own way. They're all attacking a different part of the segment. And best way for me to answer that question is, time will tell.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. Great. And then, just a follow-up on Canada. I know you talked about putting this -- having more of a North America organization and the opportunity that gives you to leverage the marketing spend cross-border, if you will. I was just curious, if any of that started in 2019. So, maybe, it's a little of housekeeping. But, for example, like the Coors Light campaign that's been so successful here, is that in Canada yet, or is that still to come? ","Gavin Hattersley","Lauren, that is still to come. It's not in Canada yet, but it will be soon. So as far as the revitalization plan is concerned, obviously, the restructuring took place with the U.S. business in the fourth quarter of 2019. But the Coors Light campaign specifically is still to hit. I'm pleased with the progress that the team has made in aligning innovation and our global brands between United States and Canada in our North American business unit. And I think you'll start seeing the impact of that as the year progresses.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. Thanks great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Laurent Grandet","Hey. Good morning, Gavin and Tracey. I'd like to come back to the seltzer category, but from a different angle. So, it's great to see us so many growth initiatives coming from you, including a differentiated seltzer proposition. So, now, as the seltzer category is expanding very fast and in many cases, at the expense of our beer and light beer for the largest part, I mean, what do you do to protect your core Coors Light and Miller Lite business? And if you any effect I mean let's say 20% of the $150 million revitalization plan on those two brands it may prove to be not enough. So, could you please help us first I mean better assess the impact of seltzer on your core two brands? And two what do you -- are you planning to minimize the risk here? Thank you.","Gavin Hattersley","Yes. A lot to unpack there Laurent, but let me try and do that. So, I would point you to the performance of Miller Lite and Coors Light in 2019 when seltzers were exploding. And according to Nielsen, the trend has continued of gaining share for those two brands for the last five years.","Our performance on Miller Lite and its 21st consecutive quarter and it actually grew STR volume in Q4 in the face of this seltzer trend. So, the brand is holding its own in the total category. In fact it was pretty flat not just in the premium light segment, but in the total beer category.","And as a combination Miller Lite and Coors Light outperformed the combination of Bud Light, Michelob Ultra, and Michelob Ultra Gold in terms of industry share. So, this notion that a lot of the seltzer volume is coming from premium light is not necessarily supported by the facts that are underlying the Miller Lite and Coors Light's performance.","Coors Light gained segment share for the third straight quarter directionally improved its performance had the best quarterly STR trend since 2017. So, we believe that our marketing is resonating. We're going to put more effort and money behind that at the same time as we are going to enter the seltzer category.","Laurent Grandet","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean King of UBS. Please go ahead.","Sean King","Hi, thanks for the question. I don't think you provided guidance for COGS per hectoliter into 2020. Any insights you can provide there and if you expect any easing pressure from aluminum given hedging positions?","Tracey Joubert","Yes. So, let me answer that Sean. So, for 2020, we've actually given both topline and bottom-line guidance which is new this year. And so we didn't feel it was necessary to give the COGS guidance. We thought top and bottom-line was more helpful.","Having said that, look our job is to manage our costs within those boundaries of top and bottom-line. And we do use -- we spoke about our robust hedging programs in the past and we've got cost-savings initiatives which help us manage those costs. But we expect to still see ongoing commodity inflation going into 2020 probably similar to what we saw in 2019. And yes, we will just manage that with our cost-savings initiatives.","Sean King","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Gavin Hattersley for any closing remarks.","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks Andrea. Look I know there may be additional questions that we weren't able to get to. So, please follow up with Greg and Tracy and I look forward to talking with many of you as the year progresses. So, thanks everybody for participating on the call.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"14686":["Molson Coors Brewing (NYSE:TAP) Q4 2013 Earnings Call February 13, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Peter S.

Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections.","The company does not take -- does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.","Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time-to-time by the company's executives in discussing the company's performance, please visit the company's website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Peter Swinburn, the President and CEO of Molson Coors.","Peter S. Swinburn","Thank you, Rob. Hello, everybody, and welcome to the Molson Coors earnings call. Thank you for joining us today.","With me on the call this morning are Gavin Hattersley, Molson Coors' CFO; Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors; Stewart Glendinning, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors Europe; Kandy Anand, CEO of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors' Chief Legal and People Officer; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors' VP of Investor Relations.","On the call today, Gavin and I will take you through highlights of our fourth quarter 2013 results from Molson Coors Brewing Company along with some perspective on 2014.","In the fourth quarter, Molson Coors increased underlying pretax earnings 6.5%, expanded pretax margins and generated substantial underlying EBITDA and free cash flow. Underlying after-tax income declined less than 1% due to a higher tax rate in the quarter.","For full year 2013, we grew underlying after-tax earnings and EBITDA and exceeded our targets for cash -- for cost saving, cash generation and debt reduction. Our focus on building our core brands, growing the above-premium segment of our portfolio and driving sales revenue from innovation was instrumental in delivering these results.","Coors Light grew more than 30% last year in the U.K. where it is now our second biggest brand. In Mexico and in Latin American markets, it grew even faster. Coors Light also gained segment share in the U.S., but underperformed in Canada, an issue in which we will focus in 2014. Miller Lite remained challenged in the U.S.","Carling, the U.K.'s #1 brand, reaffirmed its leading position by growing both volume and share in a soft U.K. market. A reinvigorated Molson Canadian brand increased both volume and share in Canada in 2013. Meanwhile, Coors Banquet achieved its seventh year of growth in the U.S. and has sold well ahead of expectations across Canada following its launch there in the third quarter.","Staropramen grew share in its home Czech market and increased volume by strong double-digits in the rest of our European business.","Our brands grew share in Bulgaria and achieved record shares in Croatia and Czech Republic. And in the second half of the year, we returned Romania to share growth as well. The loss of share in Serbia is being addressed by a new management team, and the loss in Hungary was planned as we gave up low margin private label production.","We grew our above-premium brands at a double-digit rate globally, contributing to mix-related NSR per hectoliter growth of 1.4% in the U.S. and 1% in Europe on a comparable basis in both currency. We continue to learn and progress in the craft sector through Tenth and Blake in the U.S. and Six Pints in Canada. As a result, we accounted for 29% of the 2013 Craft Beer growth in the United States according to Nielsen, and we saw our Six Pints volume in Canada increase nearly 13%.","And finally, our innovation pipeline had its best year so far and delivered nearly 6% of global net sales. Our focus on innovation remains a top priority as we extend the reach of our portfolio to bring in new drinkers to our brands.","In summary, our overall brand performance was strong and strategically, we are gaining momentum in the areas that will have the most impact on our financial results as markets begin to improve.","Regionally, we grew U.S. 2013 pretax earnings on the strength of positive net pricing, strong sales mix and significant cost reductions. Although overall industry volume declined, we held share in the Premium Light segment according to Nielsen, and we led the industry in above-premium share growth. Our above-premium portfolio now represents nearly 14% of our total net revenue, up more than 3 percentage points from 2012.","In Canada, we gained share in the value segment, which has been a source of share loss for some years, and we delivered strong cash and cost saving results, but overall performance was poor. We are reducing our cost base in the same way as we did in the United Kingdom and as a result, we will be increasing our capital spend in Canada by approximately CAD 40 million this year, with resulting benefits beginning to accrue in 2015. As in the U.K., we expect to reinvest most of these benefits back into our brands.","In Europe, as well as the brand performance as already mentioned, we also delivered growth in net pricing, earnings and cash flow. Underlying income grew at double-digit rates for the fourth quarter and the full year.","As in North America, our craft business is performing well and posted record volumes with Doom Bar becoming the biggest selling cask ale in the United Kingdom on vendors channel.","Our international business rationalized its cost base and migrated sales mix towards more profitable business in 2013. As a result, we reduced the underlying international loss by nearly half versus 2012, and are on track to our goal of profitability by 2016.","Internationally, the portfolio is led by Coors Light but has been reinforced by Staropramen and, increasingly, Blue Moon, with Carling being used tactically.","Overall, in 2013, our U.S. business improved results, especially late in the year, Europe performed well in a difficult environment, Canada struggles and international made significant progress towards its goal of profitability by 2016.","Now I'll turn it over to Gavin to give fourth quarter highlights and the perspective of 2014. Gavin?","Gavin Hattersley","Thank you, Peter, and hello, everybody. Molson Coors fourth quarter underlying pretax earnings increased 6.5% to $163.9 million, driven by higher earnings in the United States and Europe along with reduced underlying interest expense. These positive factors were partially offset by lower performance in Canada and international. Underlying aftertax income decreased 0.2% to $125.8 million, or $0.68 per share, driven by our higher underlying tax rate this year.","Our fourth quarter tax rate of 23% was higher than expected due to an out-of-period adjustment of $12 million in uncertain tax positions related to prior years. This adjustment increased our fourth quarter underlying tax rate by approximately 7 percentage points.","Foreign exchange movements had no significant net impact on pretax results in the quarter. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors increased 0.1% due to higher volume in Canada and Europe, offset by lower volume in the U.S. and international.","In the fourth quarter, our U.S. GAAP aftertax income more than doubled to $131.2 million due to a lower U.S. GAAP tax rate, higher non-core gains and higher pretax earnings in the U.S. and Europe. These positive factors were partially offset by the impairment of our Miller brand's distribution contract in Canada and onetime Tradeteam contract termination fees in Europe.","As we have in previous quarters, I will provide an overview of our results with MillerCoors presented as if it were proportionally consolidated. This is a non-GAAP approach, but we believe it provides a useful view of some key performance metrics for our business. On this basis, total company net sales increased 0.3% from the prior year, as higher volume and positive pricing and mix were largely offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements. On a per-hectoliter basis, net sales increased 0.1% driven by pricing growth across all regions and improved mix in the United States.","Underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 0.4% due to higher COGS per hectoliter in the U.S. and international.","Total company gross margin was 37.4%, 10 basis points lower than a year ago, primarily due to gross margin contraction in the U.S. and international, partially offset by gross margin expansion in Europe and Canada.","Underlying marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 0.4% driven by increases in Canada and Europe that were partially offset by declines in the U.S. Underlying operating margin was 10.9%, down 10 basis points from a year ago due to margin contraction in Canada and international, which more than offset improvement in the U.S.","For the full year, we increased proportionally consolidated operating income 2.3% to $1.03 billion on underlying basis driven by income growth in Europe and the U.S. and lower losses in international.","Our underlying EBITDA, or earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization, was $313.8 million in the fourth quarter, 2.4% higher than a year ago. For the full year, underlying EBITDA grew 5.1% to $1.47 billion. See the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.","Also important to note that our fourth quarter underlying results excludes some special and other non-core gains, losses and expenses that net to an $18.6 million pretax charge. These exclusions from our U.S. GAAP results primarily relate to the termination of our Tradeteam distribution joint venture in United Kingdom and impairment of our Miller brand's distribution contract in Canada, along with the restructuring-related costs in Canada and Europe. These charges were partially offset by gains from the sale of non-core assets.","Special and other non-core items are described in detail in this morning's earnings release.","In the area of cost savings, we exceeded our 2013 goals by achieving more than $70 million of cost reductions across our company versus our goal of $40 million to $60 million for at least a 5-year period beginning last year. These cost reductions came primarily from the U.K., but we expect cost savings over the next few years to accelerate in Canada. This result excludes MillerCoors, which provided another $43 million of savings in 2013 at our 42% ownership rates. In the fourth quarter, our Board of Directors approved the resolution to change the company's fiscal year from a 52- or 53-week fiscal year to a calendar year. As such, our 2013 fiscal year ended on December 31, 2013, rather than on December 28. This change aligns our fiscal year and interim reporting periods with our Central Europe business as well as MillerCoors, both of which already use a regular Gregorian reporting calendar.","A few additional days in fiscal year 2013 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results.","We also decided to discontinue sales accretive accounting for our marketing and sales expenses on Canada, Europe and international businesses beginning in 2014. This change will have no effect on the total amount of annual marketing and sales spending reported, but it will affect the quarterly phasing of the spending. This change in accounting policy will be presented retrospectively, so we will reclassify prior periods to reflect the new treatment.","For 2013, the elimination of sales accretive accounting is the effect of increasing MG&A expense by approximately $9 million and $15 million for the first and second quarters, respectively, and decreasing these expenses in the third and fourth quarters by approximately $17 million and $7 million, respectively.","In the next few weeks, we plan to provide you with specific 2013 quarterly impacts for each of our business units and all the way down to the EPS level for consolidated results.","Note that MillerCoors does not use sales accretive accounting, so its historical results will not be affected by this change.","We are also very pleased with our focus on cash, and profit after capital charge resulted in us exceeding our underlying free cash flow goal for 2013 by generating a total of $892 million of free cash, an increase of $27.3 million, or 3.3%, versus 2012. This result exceeded our original guidance for January 2013 by almost $200 million, and was primarily due to strong working capital management, particularly in Canada and Europe.","Underlying free cash flow in 2013 was made up of the following factors: $1.17 billion of operating cash flow, which includes $539 million from MillerCoors, plus $58 million of net add-backs, mainly cash paid for restructuring activities; investing cash outflows with $294 million of capital spending; and $41 million of cash invested in MillerCoors.","Total debt at the end of 2013 was $3.8 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $442 million, resulting in net debt of $3.36 billion, approximately $127 million lower than 3 months earlier and $687 million lower than a year earlier.","For the full year, the fund status of our defined benefit pension plans improved by $448 million, including our portion of the MillerCoors plans. And we paid down net out of the money cost currency swap positions totaling $113.9 million.","In January, we also paid off the remaining outstanding cost currency swaps for $65.2 million. Part of the credit for our strong cash and debt performance in 2013 goes to efforts to implement our PACC model. We will continue to drive organizational focus on cash generation, raising the terms on capital and growing total shareholder return. We are also still early in the implementation process for PACC, but we grew TSR for the company in 2013 at a faster rate than other global beer companies and the S&P 500.","Also in recognition of the substantial progress we have made in paying down debt, our board has authorized an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.32 per share to $0.37 per share beginning in the first quarter. This 16% increase results in an annual dividend amount of $1.48 per share, which represents a payout ratio of 18.4% of 2013 underlying EBITDA.","Equally important, I'm pleased to announce that our company is adopting for the first time a dividend payout ratio target of 18% to 22% of prior year underlying EBITDA. We anticipate that linking the dividend payouts to our underlying EBITDA, which has been strong and steady for many years, will keep our dividends in a competitive range with global beer companies for the foreseeable future.","Now looking forward to 2014. Our annual target for underlying free cash flow is $700 million, plus or minus 10%. This goal is $192 million lower than our 2013 results for these 2 primary factors: higher capital spending, driven by efficiency initiatives planned for our Canada supply chain; and we will not be able to replicate the tremendous reduction of working capital we achieved in 2013. We did plan to reduce working capital over time, but not expect it at the same rate as last year.","Currently, we expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $60 million to $90 million in 2014, down from $156 million last year. Meanwhile, we anticipate approximately $35 million of pension expense in 2014 down from $52 million last year. Note that all of these pension numbers include our 42% of MillerCoors.","The overall fund of status of our defined benefit pension plans, again, including MillerCoors, improved 8 percentage points from a year ago to 92% at the end of 2013. This improvement was driven by contributions globally, strong plan asset returns in Canada and the United Kingdom and moderate increases in long-term interest rates in 2013.","Our 2014 capital spending outlook is approximately $330 million, up from $297 million last year. We expect our 2014 MG&A expense in Foster's to be approximately $110 million. Our consolidated net interest expense outlook for 2014 is approximately $145 million.","We expect our 2014 underlying effective tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 20%, assuming no further changes in tax loss, settlements of tax orders or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions.","Our 2013 underlying rate was 15% due to onetime benefits of tax law changes in Canada.","We continue to expect our long-term tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 24%, but we anticipate that it will take a few years to move to that range.","As far as our cost outlook is concerned, in the United States, we expect MillerCoors cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a low single-digit rate for the full year 2014. In Canada, we expect our 2014 cost of goods sold to increase with a low single-digit rate per hectoliter in the local currency.","In Europe, we anticipate a low single-digit decrease in cost of goods sold into this year in local currency. Our international business anticipates COGS per hectoliter to increase at a mid single-digit rate for the full year.","In each of our businesses, we anticipate higher costs related to product and packaging innovation.","At this point I'll turn it back over to Peter for outlook, wrap up and the Q&A. Peter?","Peter S. Swinburn","Thanks, Gavin. So regionally, in the U.S. we are addressing the weak market by migrating our portfolio towards the high-margin and fast-growing above-premium segment on the strengths of -- on the strength of Redd's, Leinenkugel\u2019s and Blue Moon. We will also introduce Miller Fortune and Smith & Forge to augment the portfolio. In Premium Lights, the reintroduction of the original Miller Lite can has exceeded our expectations and will be extended through September.","Coors Light will be introducing new packaging designs adding some improved line extension debuting on Memorial Day.","Our profit performance in Canada this year will be impacted by our decision to accelerate the termination of the joint venture that controls the Modelo brands in Canada. These brands provided approximately USD 18 million of pretax profit for our Canada business in 2013, and they will only provide 2 months of income in 2014. We will, however, be paid CAD 17 million of compensation by Anheuser-Busch InBev when it assumes control of these brands on February 28, 2014. Note that this cash inflow will be excluded from our underlying free cash flow for 2014.To become a more competitive business, the Canada team in 2014 will continue the work it started last year to transform and streamline its cost base. We will introduce new advertising and increased activity to improve the performance in Coors Light, along with rolling out our proprietary vented can for this brand and Molson Canadian. Molson Canadian will also benefit from strong programming led by the Winter Olympics. We will build on the successful launch of Coors Banquet and we'll accelerate our cost performance to primo [ph] Granville Island.","In Europe, total industry volume in the markets in which we operate declined more than 3% in 2013. But in those markets, we grew share by nearly 1\/2 point. Some economies in the region are forecast to improve slightly driven by export trends, which will take time to translate into consumer spending, but there will eventually be a benefit to our business. We also expect the continued growth of value segment and low margin channels and package configurations to be headwinds in 2014.","In this challenging market, our strategies for core brands, above-premium and innovation are driving solid share in most of the region. For 2014, we plan to rollout innovative new packaging of above-premium beer mixes and other products to new markets in Europe.","Our International business in 2014 will increase its focus on driving top line growth to Coors Light, Carling, Staropramen and Blue Moon, along with other brands unique to the international markets. This, together with lower MG&A expense per hectoliter, is expected to deliver a profitable business, as promised, by 2016.","Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of the businesses early in the first quarter. For the U.S. -- in the U.S. for January, STRs decreased low single digits. For our other businesses in January, on a comparable basis, our sales-to-retail in Canada decreased at a low single-digit rate. Our sales volume in Europe increased at a mid single-digit rate, and our international sales volume, including royalty volume, increased at a low single-digit rate. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the coming quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.","So to summarize our discussion today, in 2013 we grew underlying aftertax earnings, EBITDA and earnings per share. We implemented our profit after capital charge model for our company to drive focus on the key value drivers of this business. We drove working capital performance company-wide and exceeded our 2013 free cash flow goal by nearly $200 million. We've over-delivered against our cost savings and we reduced our net debt by nearly $700 million. The funded status of our pension plans improved by $440 million, including our portion of MillerCoors, and we paid down $114 million of cost currency net liabilities. Particular challenges included Miller Lite in the U.S. and Coors Light in Canada, along with commercial performances in Serbia. Nonetheless, our focus on building our core brands, growing in the above-premium segment of our portfolio and driving sales revenue from innovation delivered significantly improved results in the year. We are gaining momentum in the areas that will have the most impact on our financial results as market begins to improve.","Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on the website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also at 2:00 p.m. Eastern time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.","So at this point, Rob, we would like to open it up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So first, in Canada, so it's nice to see you focusing on cutting cost in that market. So just wanted to get a little bit more color just in terms of your initiatives to reduce your cost base more. And then if this is beyond sort of that $40 million or $60 million of cost savings target that you've talked about in the June analyst meeting, you've clearly exceeded that number in 2013. So is there just more upside to that numbers for the next few years, particularly as you focus in the Canadian cost base restructuring?","Peter S. Swinburn","Well, I'll take it, the general point, Judy, and I'll pass it on to Gavin for the specific on the cost savings. Yes, I think the -- so we're talking impactful as this, we've been through a number of business units, specifically, lately in the U.K., so we're very confident that we know what we're doing, both in the G&A and the supply chain perspective. It is going to be a 3- to 4-year project for us. So we're just flagging at the moment the fact that there will be increased capital spending in Canada as we start that journey. But Gavin, do you want to pick up the other bit?","Gavin Hattersley","Sure, Peter. Judy, the Canada cost savings are included in the $40 million to $60 million guidance that I gave you, which is over the next 5 years with the -- us expecting to be at the higher end for the first couple of years. In 2013, the balance of those cost savings were predominantly from the United Kingdom and Europe, and the balance will shift towards Canada in the years ahead.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Got it. And then on the dividend payout target that you're setting now, so we're at 18.4% of EBITDA. So, I guess, there's a little bit more room to go to, at least the midpoint of that and perhaps more. So can you perhaps help us in terms of, is this going to be more of an annual gradual increase to get to the target? Should we expect to see more of a dividend ramp-up more quickly? And does this impact at all in terms of how you're thinking about the leverage targets or your broader capital allocation strategy and looking at M&A, buyback, et cetera?","Peter S. Swinburn","So obviously, Judy, we've given a range between 18% to 22%. We've done that for that purpose. We do -- we're currently at the lower end of that range, and our intention would be, obviously, to move up from there. It will vary year-by-year depending on what are the costs we've got on our cash by definition. As far as our debt position is concerned, we are still very much focused on getting to the levels that we promised the rating agencies, and that's our first priority. Once we get there, we will then decide with our board how we best want to allocate whatever cash we might have, and that will be consistent with the way that we've done it in the past in terms of looking at our balance sheet, giving [indiscernible] share that's all indeed, looking at other opportunities to invest it. So I think it will be pretty consistent with the message that we've given you up to date.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then my last question, just maybe for Stewart. Just looking at the Canada market, I guess, the volume challenges still remain in that market with fourth quarter, and then January sales-to-retailer is down low single digits. Just can you help us understand, just from a broader macro perspective, as well as competitive perspective, any changes that you're noticing there? What can you really do to drive Coors Light volume to improve in 2014? And how do you think that the competitive environment will really evolve in the near term?","Peter S. Swinburn","So again I'll just take it generally, I'll let Stewart answer the specific, but the Canadian -- on the surface, the Canadian economy is doing all right. But if you look at the areas where we get 70% of our profit from, which is in Quebec and Ontario, those 2 markets, actually, the GDP of those 2 markets have been extremely lackluster, and the unemployment rate is quite a bit higher than the United States. And so the markets -- the specific markets that drive our profit performance have been quite challenged. Coors Light, I think, we didn't pay enough attention to last year. But Stewart, I'll pass that over to you to talk about what we're going to do with our brand in 2014.","Stewart F. Glendinning","Yes. Perfect. Judy, look, as it relates to the market, I would just -- before I get to Quebec, just point out that I think we have done a really good job of growing our above-premium brands. We also have seen share gain in both above-premium and value. So we're starting to move the ball, Molson Canadian has performed very well as against its history. Against Coors Light, as I said last quarter, we simply have not had enough news. And I think if you looked at this year, you'll see better copy coming out and you'll see better activation. Last year, we struggled in our execution. And as we started off this year, we've got TV ad copy now running around our vented can innovation, which we shared with you, you'll see new copy coming out in the middle of the year, and then reinforced efforts around activation, so. One thing, Judy, I would just also raise, I should have included this, but Coors Banquet, of course, will be going to the market. Peter talked about that in the earnings script. But in -- just in terms of the health of the family and in terms of the health of the trademark, Coors Banquet is going very, very well, and we think there's a good halo and interworking relationship between the 2 brands.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ian Shackleton from Nomura.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Two questions around Europe. You've got a major point, you had a little savings in Europe in '13. Is that all done now? Is there still stuff coming out and regional StarBev pot announces the merger -- popped between the U.K. and the Europe? My second question was really around the shape of the revenue going forward. Sales revenue per hectoliter's pretty strong, and I remember at the beginning of the year, it's certainly weakened. I mean, how do you see the balance of revenue going forward into '14 then?","Peter S. Swinburn","So I'll let Mark take the second one in particular and certainly comment on the first. But the savings in Europe, just to clarify, there were 2 pieces. We did say we got $15 million in synergies out of the Staropramen business. We're well on track to do that. The $40 million to $60 million savings, as Gavin intimated, quite a bit of that came out of the restructuring we did -- I mean we are already doing in effect to the U.K. supply chain base and then some MG&A, you have to have some G&A expense savings as well. So they are 2 different issues here. Mark, do you want to build on that?","Mark Hunter","Yes, sure. Ian, it's Mark Hunter here. Just in terms of adding to Peter's comments around overall savings. I think 2 continuing opportunities in Europe: one is the transfer of ZBB as a framework approach [indiscernible] we've made from the Central European business across into the U.K. and that's extracting further value of the U.K. business. And some of the learnings from the operational excellence around supply chain, again, we're kind of reversing that back into the U.K. And then there are some further opportunities, building on the back of the capital investment programs that's been running in the U.K. for 3 years to [indiscernible] supply chain. So there's still more for us to extract within the U.K. business, which is good news. The Central European business is already running pretty lean, as you would expect. In terms of the top line, I have to say I've been pretty pleased with our management and focus of the top line. Our total revenues went downward because of the lackluster demand we've seen and overall volume sluggishness. And we're conscious that this is an area of focus for us going forward. And what we have done in 2013 is really step change to revenue management capability, grow an additional resource, extend it [indiscernible] our thinking. And it's clearly one of the key levers from a PACC management perspective. So there's lots of [indiscernible] and increased capability around the revenue management performance going forward.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And could I just follow up with the Tradeteam agreement having gone, what was the rationale for that? And presuming from a distribution point of view, you are still using effects of the Tradeteam structure, are you?","Peter S. Swinburn","Mark?","Mark Hunter","Yes. So the Tradeteam joint venture was formed back in the mid-90s when all of the assets from what was Bass Brewers business transferred across through DHL to foreign trading. As we move forward almost 20 years, we felt it was appropriate for us to remove ourselves from that joint venture, and that's been handled very effectively. It made sense for us, it made sense for DHL. So it's closed and dissolved the joint venture and we now have what we believe to be very competitive market rates on arms length, commercial arrangement, [indiscernible] Primary and secondary distribution arrangements. So we're still using Tradeteam assets but underwritten by DHL overall. And based on all the benchmarking we've done we feel we're in a very good place there, so competitiveness around our logistics costs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian for Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was just hoping for a bit more clarity on Canada. From a brand standpoint, is it mainly just the Coors brew or are there other pieces of the portfolio that are under pressure here? Because it seems like a pretty dramatic slowdown in the last couple of quarters. And then do you think you're investing enough back behind that business and marketing, given the MG&A declines this year? And what are the plans with marketing going forward as we look out to 2014 and beyond?","Peter S. Swinburn","Stewart, do you want to pick that one up?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Yes, happy to do that. I mean, look -- and go back to the point that I made with Judy. I mean, we expect to see more news, better copy and strong activation around Coors Light. So put that on the one side. Is it more than Coors Light? Yes, Coors Light, by and large, is the biggest chunk. The slowdown you saw at the end of last year, you should reflect on the fact that in the prior year, we had the launch of Coors Light Iced T and we were lapping that. So pull that out, that's at least 1\/3 of the impact of the Coors Light performance last year. In addition to Coors Light, we've got a couple of tail brands that are pretty large brands for us in Qu\u00e9bec, not unlike other CPG companies, you will have some of those trade brands. We'll be pursuing some tactics there, not dissimilar to what we did in value to make sure that we optimize what we're getting out of those brands. So I don't know if that covers it, but...","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. and then from a marketing perspective...","Stewart F. Glendinning","Sorry, you did ask on the investment. Just back to the investment. Do I think we're investing enough behind the brand? The answer is yes. One thing to keep in mind is that this year, there has been a re-class of some of the impact promotions that we've seen. So we've seen more impact promotions in the marketplace. Those impact promotions are recorded as cost of goods sold and not as marketing. We've reallocated those funds simply because of our move to more impact. So I wouldn't look just at the MG&A line trying to understand how much we're spending against marketing.","Peter S. Swinburn","And, Dara, if I can just try and conceptualize all this for you. I mean, if you think about what we've laid out consistently, we've said we want to grow market share with our core brands, develop above-premium, be strong in innovation. If you look at what's happened in Canada, we've turned most in Canadian around in the last 3 years, we grew share this year. Above-premium, we've had a good year with Six Pints, some of the weakest brands. Innovation is being good this year, it's not being spectacular but we've been exceptionally well with cider, and we've got a very good innovation program coming through. Additionally in Canada, we have -- you'll see where we were losing share in value, we put that right this year. So yes, there's more stuff going on, but when you strip it all back, it does really come back to getting Coors Light motoring again. And we're pretty confident we understand what we've got to do, to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, just in Canada -- or the capital spending in Canada related to the projects related to efficiency, is that spending connected to the $40 million to $60 million of overall cost savings that you've outlined previously? Or will the benefit you get from that capital investment over time sort of be on top of your already articulated cost savings?","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes. I think we might have answered that earlier. I'll just check with Gavin.","Gavin Hattersley","Yes, Bryan. The capital spending, which we're putting into kind of the extra amount, is associated with the cost savings of $40 million to $60 million. And we're using our PACC model to make sure that the decisions we're making up there are driving the right returns for us from a shareholder-return point of view.","Peter S. Swinburn","Overall, Brian, our capital spending isn't going up by the full $40 million. It's going up by about $32 million, I think.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question is -- just is, we're kind of looking at covering some of the COGS-per-hectoliter inflation on a local basis. Just conceptually, how much is -- will some of that be covered with price increases? Or are you expecting productivity to cover that as you go into '14?","Peter S. Swinburn","Well, I mean, there's a number of things that will affect it obviously. But Gavin, do you want to go through the detail?","Gavin Hattersley","Yes, sure, Bryan. I mean, we've got a lot of things that change a cost of goods sold. So from a negative point of view, our cost of goods sold increases because of our increased focus on the above-premium sector and innovation. So that does add cost to -- to COGS. But the expectation, obviously, is that when we do innovation in above-premium that we're going to draw value at the top line and a favorable overall mix. Certainly, our cost saving programs are included in our cost of goods sold guidance, although not all of it is in there. There is a decent portion that comes in the MG&A line. So it's a combination of factors, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. So I guess I might have misunderstood. The COGS per hectoliter inflation you're expecting for '14 is not just simply like commodity costs or packaging cost increases. There's also a mix component there.","Gavin Hattersley","Right. It's digital in number for us. I mean, in MCI, for example, you would have an impact on COGS based on the nature of the business, whether it was export business or license business or whether it was in Asia or whether it was in Europe. So there's -- that's -- all of those factors are all in our cost of goods sold guidance.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last question relative to the PACC model. And if you could just maybe give us a little bit more description on -- last year, 2013 was the first real year where you've implemented it, and there was some benefit or some result from that implementation. And then so as you move forward into '14 and it's more fully ingrained or implemented even further, like do you expect a step-change benefit in terms of having it become more ingrained? So I'm just trying to -- because you had a pretty good early return, so I'm just trying to understand, do you expect to see even more benefits from it as you move into '14?","Peter S. Swinburn","I mean, at the top line, Bryan, we've nearly gone down. So we've been talking about it and really, we came out with it last year. But we've been talking about it and implementing quite a bit of it in the organization prior to that. So it's not a big flash-bang that we introduced it last year and got results from it last year. So there was a sort of a lead in. The -- really, what we're trying to do is ensure that we've got a very robust internal measurement that helps us actually focus totally on total shareholder return. And that's just going to be ongoing. But Gavin, do you want to talk specifically about 2014?","Gavin Hattersley","Yes. Sure, Peter. I mean, we did get some significant benefit out of it in 2013. And we focused in on the senior levels of our management team, Bryan. We will, obviously, be pushing it out further. Probably it takes years to really ingrain it in an organization. So I would expect it to take several years to get it right through the organization. And yes, I do expect some benefits coming forward in 2014. Obviously, we had a step-change improvement in our working capital in 2013. We don't expect to repeat that in '14, but we still expect to drive working capital savings out, and we expect to continue to drive total shareholder return monthly, as Peter said, on all the decisions we make, whether it be capital expenditure or new package innovation as examples.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of cash flow-related questions, but I do have to ask, you went into this in Gregorian calendar in Canada. My question there is what came before that?","Peter S. Swinburn","The next question, Mark?","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So, no, on the cash side of things, you're -- a couple of things. Firstly, cap spending for the total company, I didn't catch that. What's your thinking for '14 on cap spending?","Peter S. Swinburn","On capital spending, about $330 million, Mark.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. And then you're selling non-core assets. Two questions there. You had a $22 million gain in the quarter. I didn't catch what that was, can you speak to what that was? And then more broadly, where do you think you are in this exercise of selling non-core assets?","Peter S. Swinburn","Well, the specific on that particular one which you've raised was, it's predominantly our sale of our stake in the Colorado Rockies. And as part of the PACC model, we're turning over all our assets to see if they meet our desired shareholder returns. And when they don't, we take action on it, Mark. So it is an ongoing exercise. Either we improve the return out of the assets or we dispose of it.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got it. And can you speak, Gavin, to the size of the assets that are still kind of eligible for that consideration, something to give us some sense of potential scale?","Peter S. Swinburn","We can't really, Mark. And again, this isn't something that we just sort of discovered. We've been down this -- going down this road a long, long time. And certainly in Europe and the U.K., we stripped just about everything that's sellable on 2 of those businesses. Canada, there might be something there, and some stuff around in the U.S. But it's not going to be seismic.","Gavin Hattersley","And Mark, we stripped that out of underlying. So we wouldn't include that in our underlying results.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Rob Ottenstein from ISI.","Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Was there a comment earlier on in the call about Miller brands in Canada? I seem to have thought I heard the word impairment, but I can't recall.","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes, it was in the script which Gavin referred to about taking an impairment in the fourth quarter. What exactly is the question, Robert?","Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Well, okay. So is there -- can you just tell us what exactly is going on there? And is that related to the lawsuit with SAB?","Gavin Hattersley","Yes, Robert, it is. It is related to the value of our Miller intangible up in Canada. In the quarter, we updated our probability weighted range of possible outcomes. And of course, there are many, many items of that situation out there. We updated our probability rated model and determined that we needed to impair our intangible asset up there by around $18 million.","Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But no actual decision's come down yet on the lawsuit, isn't that correct?","Peter S. Swinburn","That's correct.","Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you talk a little bit, I know it's small, but just I'd like to get a better understanding of what your strategy is for Australia, and why, in particular, you're focusing on that market now?","Peter S. Swinburn","Well, Australia has always been a market of interest for us because it's a heavily branded market and it's a market we understand. And we think we're very fortunate to have landed such an excellent partner with such a great track record in Coke Amatil. But on the -- Kandy, did you want to talk about the detail?","Krishnan Anand","Sure, Robert. Yes, as Peter said, we're delighted to have entered Canada with a very powerful partner with Coca-Cola Amatil. We launched Coors and Blue Moon in the market just about 2 months ago, so it's early days. But our lead is out, we're very, very happy with. The distribution of all those brands are well ahead of plan. The consumer uptick initial days are good. It's early days to predict where that's going to lead to, but we are very confident that our partnership with Coca-Cola Amatil will be very fruitful for us in the years to come.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of John Faucher from JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, I wanted to talk a little bit about the Canada profit situation as we look into 2014. So it looks like you're going to have the winding down of the JV progress, and you said -- I guess, and then probably you're going to have some transactional FX along with the fall in the Canadian dollar. So it seems like the negatives are out there. Is there something more positive from that standpoint that can offset some of the pressures that we're expecting to see there in 2014?","Peter S. Swinburn","Okay. So first of all, the Modelo JV, yes. In terms of ongoing earnings, it will impact this year. But we have actually got the profit from that in cash for the rest of the contract. So we don't -- we've extracted the value, which is the important thing, and we're pleased with that. FX at the moment, yes, we'll see which way FX goes, it could be for benefit one year, it's not a benefit the next. So it's a bit like the weather, to be honest with you, that washes around. In terms of the overall business in Canada, as I outlined earlier, the provinces on which we rely overly, are we struggling into economically. Having said that, and this is a bit of a roundabout way of answering the question, we're pretty upbeat about the U.S. environment and we do think the U.S. environment is improving. It'll take time to come through. And that will benefit those provinces we're talking about, specifically Ontario. So if you look forward 2 to 3 years, we're much more upbeat about consumer demand coming through over that period of time. Within that, within Canada, our core activities, they were exactly the same, we wanted to drive up above-premium. We're really pleased with the way Six Pints are developing, much as Tenth completed in the U.S. We've got strong double-digit growth from there and we're encouraged by that, and we think this year will be a good year. In terms of core brands, we've talked about Molson Canadian's done exceptionally well, we will turn around Coors Light. And in terms of above-premium, as I've said, we -- Coors Banquet is selling at an index well above 100 of Coors Light. We've got a very strong innovation program coming through for Canada this year, which you'll hear more about later in the year. So really, it is going back to the core strategies of focusing on our brands, which as I said earlier, across most of our markets we've done actually very successfully during 2013. So I don't know if that answers your question, John, but that's...","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It does. I mean I think, I guess, what you're saying is, I mean, 2014 could be a tough profit year, but you feel like you're taking a lot of good steps, particularly in terms of getting the productivity going, et cetera, that you think you'll be in better shape as we look a little bit farther out. Is that a fair statement?","Peter S. Swinburn","That's a fair statement. We'll have a more efficient cost base from which to move from, over the period and, you pick your number, 2 to 3 years, we do believe by the end of that, consumer confidence will have improved. And if you look at what we've done, if you take it outside of Canada, look what we're doing in Europe, again really tough environment. You would have read other reports on how people have done in Europe. We do -- in a tough environment, we've gained half a share point in the markets in which we operate and we're doing that because our core brands are strong, because we've invested in them. We're moving above-premium and our innovation program is strong. So it's the same strategy across the piece.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And hopefully -- I've seen a couple of new stories about the beer fridge over in Sochi. So hopefully, you're getting some good PR on that as well.","Peter S. Swinburn","I think you're one of many, many, many millions of people across the world who have seen that. It's pretty -- that was a great coup.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to our presenters.","Peter S. Swinburn","Okay. Well thank you, everybody, for joining us today and for your interest in the business. And I look forward to seeing you at the -- some of the script call at the end of the first quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

Before we begin, I will paraphrase the company\u2019s Safe Harbor language.","Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today. So please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections.","The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.","Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time to time by company\u2019s executives in discussing the company\u2019s performance, please visit the company\u2019s website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the financial reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results.","Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior-year period in U.S. dollars.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors.","Mark Hunter","Thank you, Nicole. And hello and welcome everybody to the Molson Coors earnings call. Apologies for that slight delay due to a technical issue. Many thanks for joining us today.","With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have: Mauricio Restrepo, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, CEO of MillerCoors; Stewart Glendinning, CEO of Canada; Simon Cox, our European CEO; Kandy Anand, our International CEO; Lee Reichert, our Deputy General Counsel; Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, the VP of Investor Relations.","For our earnings call today, Mauricio and I will take you through highlights of our second quarter 2016 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective on the second half of 2016.","In the second quarter, we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio, underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investment, as we discussed on our first quarter earnings call.","Progress in the second quarter included; net sales revenue per hectoliter growth on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses, strong Coors Light growth globally, improved core brand momentum, fast-growing innovations in key markets, and strong above premium growth globally.","We significantly increased investments behind our brands, although the timing of shipments and other short-term factors held back bottom-line performance in the quarter. In brands, Coors Light grew volume more than 4% globally, including strong double-digit growth in Europe and Latin America and low-single-digit growth in the U.S., its best performance here in nearly three years.","In above premium, our craft portfolio drove growth from Doom Bar and other Sharp\u2019s brands in the UK; from Creemore Springs and Belgian Moon in Canada; and from Leinenkugel\u2019s Grapefruit Shandy and newly acquired Saint Archer in the U.S.","Staropramen grew strongly across Europe outside of its home market, and in ciders, we grew volume with Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. In Flavored Malt Beverages, we now have the largest hard soda franchise in the U.S. with the successful introduction of the Henry\u2019s Hard Soda brands earlier this year.","We continued to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations, and implementation of common global systems.","To ensure that our supply chain is fit for the future, in the second quarter, we reached an agreement to purchase land in British Columbia on which we\u2019ll build a new efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years. This new brewery site is attractively priced, has rail access, and is situated on the Trans-Canada Highway, making it ideal for serving the Western Canada and U.S. markets. And we anticipate completing the land purchase this month.","In the past few months, we\u2019ve also made substantial progress on the pending MillerCoors transaction, including in integration planning and completing the necessary financing at very attractive rates. Investor demand for our recent debt offering was very strong, and we achieved record and near-record low interest rates on our debt issue. We\u2019re pleased with the transaction progress made to-date, and we continue to plan for a closing before the end of 2016. More specifically, October the 10, based on the joint ABI\/SAB recent announcements.","We\u2019re very excited to be much closer to completing this game-changing transaction, which will enable simplified decision-making and will reduce the complexities of dual ownership; it will help us to become a more integrated and efficient brewer; and it will enable us to become a more effective competitor as a single owner, promoting consumer choice in an increasingly diverse and fast-growing brewing industry.","As part of integration planning process, last week, I announced some leadership appointments that will strengthen our combined organization and that will take effect upon the close of the transaction. Our transaction and its timing remain dependent clearly on the completion of the ABI and SABMiller transaction.","The regional highlights for the second quarter are as follows. In the U.S. while overall sales-to-retail volume decreased 1.7%, driven primarily by our below premium brands, Coors Light STRs were up low-single digits in the quarter, which was its best quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2012. Domestic net revenue per hectoliter grew 0.7% for the quarter as a result of favorable net pricing and positive sales mix.","Our largest brand gained share of the Premium Light segment for the fifth consecutive quarter. And please note that all our performance discussions relating to Coors Light exclude the Citrus Radler extension that was discontinued last year.","With flat STRs, Miller Lite gained share of the Premium Light segment for the seventh consecutive quarter. Improved momentum for these two brands was driven by continued rollout of their new visual identities and consumer communications, which appeal to a broad section of men and women, millennials and multicultural consumers.","Additionally, Coors Banquet is now in its tenth consecutive year of growth. In the higher-margin above premium segment, Henry\u2019s was the number one Hard Soda franchise in the second quarter on the strength of Henry\u2019s Hard Orange and Ginger Ale. In craft, Leinenkugel\u2019s Grapefruit Shandy and the newly acquired Saint Archer brands continued to drive volume, although Blue Moon Belgian White declined low-single digits.","As an important indication of the traction we\u2019re gaining in the U.S., for the first time in the history of the joint venture, in 2016 MillerCoors finished number one in the Tamarron Supplier Survey, which polls hundreds of U.S. distributors in rating the performance of beer, wine and spirits suppliers. This is a key accomplishment in our First Choice ambition for our customers and is an example of the types of efforts we are driving globally to ensure we are focusing on these important customer relationships.","On the bottom line, MillerCoors\u2019 second quarter underlying net income declined 3.8% to $468.8 million, driven primarily by the timing of shipments due to calendar shifts, which were partially offset by lower cost of goods sold, higher net pricing and positive sales mix.","Meanwhile, Molson Coors\u2019 second quarter underlying equity income in the U.S. segment increased 1.4% due to an $11.1 million anticipated refund of federal excise tax paid on imports. This tax refund is based on qualifying volumes exported from the U.S. by Coors Brewing Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Molson Coors, and was driven by new legislation enacted this year in the U.S. First half underlying equity earnings in the U.S. segment, which was not as significantly affected by the timing of beer shipments, increased 9.4%.","In Canada, STRs declined 0.1%, and our sales volume declined 0.8% in the second quarter. Weak economic conditions in Western Canada were largely offset by favorable timing of the Canada Day holiday this year. Net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 1.2% in the quarter, despite competitive pressures in the East and a pronounced consumer shift to value brands in Alberta.","In core brands, although Coors Light volumes declined, our new packaging, advertising and in-pack sales promotions are driving improved consumer purchase intent and brand health scores. Molson Canadian volume suffered from a significant shift towards the value segment in Alberta.","In above premium and craft, we continued to see strong performance, as Coors Banquet, Belgian Moon, Mad Jack, Heineken, Dos Equis, Sol, and Strongbow Cider all grew volume and share in the quarter, along with our Creemore Springs craft brands\u2019.","In headline financial results for the quarter, Canada underlying pre-tax income decreased 19.7% in constant currency, primarily due to a significant increase in sales and marketing investment, as we discussed on our last earnings call. Looking at the first half on the same basis, underlying pre-tax income decreased 10.1%, also driven primarily by increased brand investments.","Our Europe business achieved 1.6% volume growth and increased market share across the region, driven by growth in seven of our 11 lead core and premium brands. Net sales revenue per hectoliter increased 1.3% in local currency, driven entirely by brand and geographic mix.","In core brands, Carling, Bergenbier and Ozujsko all grew share of segment in their primary markets. In our above premium portfolio increased momentum, with strong double-digit growth by Coors Light and our craft portfolio; including Blue Moon, Doom Bar and the other Sharp\u2019s brands.","Finally, the inclusion of Rekorderlig cider since the middle of 2015 and the full repatriation of the Staropramen brand in the UK this year added to the solid progress we made in premiumizing our Europe portfolio.","Consistent with the first quarter, underlying pre-tax income was lower in the quarter due to higher brand investments and amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and the termination of the Heineken contract brewing arrangements in the UK, along with unfavorable foreign currency movements this quarter.","Our International business grew Coors Light at a strong double-digit rate in the second quarter, driven by Latin America, including our brand launch in Colombia late last year. Overall volume including royalty volume declined 9.3%, driven by the enactment of alcohol prohibition in Bihar, in India; the transfer of Staropramen in the UK to our Europe segment; and the volume impact of our substantial China restructure.","Underlying pre-tax performance improved in the second quarter. And drivers included volume growth in Latin America and Japan, favorable sales mix, as well as lower price promotion and overhead expenses related to the restructure of our China business last year, including cycling $3.6 million of price promotion expense a year-ago.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mauricio to give second quarter financial highlights and perspective on the balance of 2016. Mauricio?","Mauricio Restrepo","Thank you, Mark, and hello everybody. As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless I note otherwise. Our second quarter financial headlines are as follows.","Net sales were down approximately 2% in U.S. dollars due to currency movements. On a constant-currency basis, net sales increased 1.9%, driven by Europe, Canada and International. Our net sales per hectoliter increased 2.4% in constant currency, due to positive mix.","On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported pre-tax income of $196.9 million, 32.1% lower than a year ago, while after-tax income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors was $174.1 million, down 24.1% from the prior-year result. These decreases were primarily due to non-cash special charges and other non-core expenses related to our pending acquisition, the alcohol prohibition in Bihar, and planned brewery closures, along with higher MG&A expenses.","Underlying pre-tax income in constant currency decreased 6.9% in the quarter and 8.6% on a reported basis, partly due to year-over-year differences in the timing of brand investments and other expenses, as well as lower worldwide volume. First half results eliminate some of these quarterly timing differences and reflected 3.4% growth in constant currency underlying pre-tax income and 2% growth on a reported basis in U.S. dollars.","Second quarter underlying after-tax income decreased 9.2% to $239.5 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, driven by lower worldwide volume, higher brand investments in all of our businesses, and negative foreign currency movements, which were partially offset by positive mix, lower underlying net interest expense and higher underlying U.S. equity income.","Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $428.7 million, that is 5.8% lower than a year ago, while our first half underlying EBITDA grew 1.2%. Underlying free cash flow in the first half of 2016 was $158.9 million. This represents a decrease of $82.2 million from the prior-year, primarily driven by lower underlying after-tax income, negative foreign currency, and less benefit from working capital changes, excluding special and other non-core items, including higher cash paid for taxes.","In early July, we completed a $7 billion long-term debt offering with a weighted-average coupon of 2.9%, including the lowest 30-year BBB-minus coupon ever issued in U.S. dollars, as well as 1.25% coupon for our eight-year euro debt issue.","As a result of these attractive rates, we anticipate that our annualized interest cost on the transaction financing will be approximately $260 million at current interest and foreign exchange rates. This annual interest expense is nearly $200 million lower than the assumed bridge-loan and other transaction-related interest expense included in the 2015 pro forma financial results that we filed in May.","With the debt offering, we achieved broad, high-quality investor participation and attractive pricing. More than 400 institutional investors participated in the offering.","Combining this debt issue with our $2.6 billion equity offering in February and up to $3 billion of a previously arranged term loan, we now have in place all the financing needed for the pending MillerCoors transaction.","Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $3 billion, which does not include the $7 billion of long-term debt we issued in July. Cash and cash equivalents totaled slightly less than $3 billion, resulting in net debt of $37 million, which is significantly lower than prior-year due to the cash proceeds received from our equity offering earlier in the year. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.","Now looking forward to the remainder of 2016, following are some factors to consider for the last two quarters of this year: Incremental Europe brand amortization expense, with an annualized impact of approximately $15 million, which began in the fourth quarter of 2015, along with lower net pension benefit in Europe this year.","A total prohibition on the sale of alcohol, unexpectedly implemented by the state government in Bihar, in early April. We don\u2019t know how long this ban will be in place, and we expect this development to present a headwind for our International business for the foreseeable future or until it is overturned.","And, finally, foreign currency translation, which at current exchange rates would be headwind of about $13 million to our underlying pre-tax results in the second half this year, with most of the impact in Europe. Given the recent volatility of our key foreign currencies, particularly the British pound, it is important to watch these rates closely.","Regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following metrics exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction, the timing of which will have a big impact on virtually all of our guidance measures.","For the full-year, we continue to expect, cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016, and pension expense of approximately $17 million, including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions and expense.","MG&A expense in Corporate of approximately $120 million on an underlying basis, which excludes expenses related to our pending transaction. Consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million on an underlying basis, which excludes transaction-related interest expense and income. An underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits, or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions.","In updated guidance, we now expect underlying capital spending of approximately $220 million, which excludes capital this year related to the construction of our new brewery in British Columbia. As far as our cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe in local currency to increase at a low-single-digit rate for the full-year 2016.","We now expect 2016 MillerCoors COGS per hectoliter to decrease at a low-single-digit rate versus prior-year. Further cost reductions, including acceleration of some of our cost savings initiatives, and changes in sales mix drove the change from previous guidance of approximately in line. We now expect our International COGS per hectoliter to increase at a double-digit rate for 2016. This is up from a high-single digit increase previously, due to geographic mix changes.","We continue to expect annual cost savings for this year and next year to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million. This view excludes cost savings from MillerCoors, as well as synergies resulting from the pending MillerCoors acquisition, which we expect to be $200 million by year four following the transaction close.","Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the third quarter. In the U.S., for the three weeks through July 23, STRs decreased at a mid-single digit rate, partially due to the timing of the load-in for the July 4 holiday, while they decreased at a high-single digit rate in Canada for the same period.","In Europe, volume through July 25 decreased high-single digits. And our International sales volume, including royalty volume, through July 23 decreased at a low-single-digit rate, primarily due to the alcohol prohibition in Bihar.","As ever, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead. Also, as a reminder, following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we plan to discontinue providing these early-next-quarter volume trends.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap up and the Q&A. Mark?","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Mauricio. In the second half of this year, we will continue to drive our First Choice for consumer and customer agenda in the geographies and segments where we choose to play, ensuring we build a broader, stronger and more premium portfolio, while driving best-in-class customer service and partnerships.","In the U.S., MillerCoors remains laser-focused on its strategy to drive total volume growth by 2019. For the first time in many years, our largest business is in line with its volume expectations through the first six months. The quarter also provided additional steps toward its growth ambition, with strengthened marketing behind flagship brands Coors Light and Miller Lite, and we\u2019re starting to see the positive impact.","Also, we continue to see success in the innovation space. In above premium, we remain bullish on the potential of Henry\u2019s, as the hard soda category continues to grow. In the second quarter, Henry\u2019s became the number-one hard soda franchise, and MillerCoors plans to roll out Henry\u2019s Hard Cherry Cola this month.","In the craft segment, MillerCoors will continue to invest behind ad support for Blue Moon and Leinenkugel\u2019s during the balance of the peak beer selling season. MillerCoors also recently announced that it has agreed to purchase a majority interest in Oregon-based Hop Valley Brewing Company and to increase its ownership of the Georgia-based Terrapin Beer Company from a minority stake to a majority interest. These are highly regarded brewers both in their regions and nationwide, and they further strengthen our leading U.S. craft portfolio, which also includes Blue Moon, Leinenkugel\u2019s, and Saint Archer.","Additionally, next month at its fall meeting with distributors, the U.S. team will share plans to improve the performance of its below premium portfolio. And the team continues to expand its Building with Beer retail strategy beyond the on-premise to additional channels to build First Choice customer partnerships.","With changes pending in the MillerCoors ownership structure, the mood is not one of apprehension, but of excitement. In the meantime, everyone at MillerCoors remains disciplined, decisive and accountable for growing our business, transforming our portfolio, and driving shareholder value.","In Canada, we are investing behind new product-quality-focused advertising and improved sales execution via our Field Sales Management program. These efforts are aimed not only at improving our premium performance, but also continuing to accelerate our growing above premium portfolio.","We will continue our push in the hard soda space with Mad Jack Root Beer and Ginger Ale, the first major hard soda entries in Canada. Additionally, we signed a partnership agreement in May with Brasseur de Montreal to leverage its craft and specialty beers in Quebec and across our strong Canada distribution network. Following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we\u2019re also looking forward to bringing the Miller brands back into our Canada portfolio.","In Europe, we achieved top-line and market-share growth in the second quarter on the strength of our core and above premium brands, along with the addition of the Rekorderlig cider and Staropramen brands in the UK.","Increased brand amortization expense will continue to present a headwind for one more quarter, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across Europe to continue to grow share of segment. This will include leveraging our English Premier League sponsorship well beyond Carling in the UK to many high-potential brand and market opportunities.","We will also continue to premiumize our portfolio, with Coors Light, the Sharp\u2019s portfolio led by Doom Bar, Cobra, Rekorderlig and Staropramen in the UK, as well as Ireland\u2019s leading craft brand, Franciscan Well.","Our International business is focused on continuing to accelerate our overall growth in existing and select new markets, while attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant-currency basis versus our original 2013 commitment, now excluding the impact of the Bihar alcohol prohibition.","Upon closing of the MillerCoors transaction, we will integrate the Miller international brands into our portfolio and leverage a footprint that complements our growth strategy and allows us to gain entrance into high-priority markets, while increasing our business scale in current markets.","We\u2019ll also continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light in Latin America. Going forward, the Coors, Miller and Staropramen brands will be the priorities for our International brand portfolio. And in India, we\u2019ll continue to add scale through our Mount Shivalik business.","To wrap up, in the second half of 2016, we will continue to focus on our First Choice for consumer and customer ambition, all driven through our Profit After Capital Charge lens and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns.","Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, 1 P.M. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via web cast on our website.","Additionally, we hope to see many of you at the Barclays Consumer Staples Conference in Boston on September 7.","So, at that point, Nicole, we\u2019d like to open it up for questions, please. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Judy Hong","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Mark Hunter","Hey, Judy.","Mauricio Restrepo","Hi, Judy.","Judy Hong","So first, it seems like your volume trends have worsened in July for all of your regions. I\u2019m understanding that this is really your short-term trend, but can you provide any color just in terms of how much is this maybe worsening macro versus timing versus any other drivers of that softness?","Mark Hunter","Hey, Judy. It\u2019s Mark. Let me take that. I mean, as we\u2019ve intimated, we\u2019re going to discontinue post the acquisition of these short-term trends because my idea is that they are not helpful and there\u2019s so much volatility around trading days, the timing of holidays, some of the promotional activity in the market. So, it\u2019s very, very difficult to take a read on it. So, it\u2019s very early in the quarter. I think if you look at our longer term volume trends, that\u2019s a much better indication as to the health of our business, and I really won\u2019t read too much in for the short-term numbers.","Judy Hong","Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then the second quarter, obviously we\u2019ve seen your brand investments step up, and you certainly called out that this would happen in the quarter. But, just wanted to get a sense of some of the payback that you\u2019re seeing as you step up these investments and the likelihood that you continue to see these investments going forward.","And then if I drill down into Canada, it seems like certainly the STR got better in the second quarter, but margins did get negatively impacted. So, sort of the trade-off that you\u2019re seeing in that particular region in terms of share versus profitability.","Mark Hunter","Okay. Well, couple of questions in there, Judy. So, I\u2019ll pass over to Stewart shortly to pick up on the Canada-specific question. I think your broader point on investment is a good question. I mean, we are driving a First Choice for consumer and customer agenda. Central to that is the quality, the breadth and depth of our brand portfolio and our ability to premiumize our portfolio, while building a customer relationship.","So, we made good on the commitment to step up our investment through the second quarter. I think if you look at our NSR per hectoliter, we saw NSR per hec growth in all of our regions. I\u2019m encouraged by the sequential improvement in our share trends in all of our regions as well from Q1 into Q2. But clearly, brand building is a long-term game, and my objective and the executive\u2019s objective here is to continue to invest in a sustained way. Clearly, the focus is always on the quality of our investments.","You\u2019ve heard me say in the past, I\u2019d rather spend less dollars in a great idea than more dollars in a bad idea, but our job is to develop great ideas and then invest in a sustained way, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, and I expect to see us continue to do that through the third quarter as well. As I say, the sequential improvement that you\u2019ve seen from Q1 to Q2, I think, is a testament to the focus and outlook right across our business.","Stewart, do you want to pick up on the Canada-specific question? Do we have Stewart? Stewart, are you on mute or have we lost you? If we\u2019ve lost you, you won\u2019t be able to answer that question. It sounds like we\u2019ve lost Stewart for a second.","So, Judy, we\u2019ll get him back in, and then I\u2019ll fill him back on to answer your specific question. If you can just bear with us. Apologies for that. We seem to have a couple of technical hitches this morning.","Judy Hong","Got it. Okay. That\u2019s fine. Thank you.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Judy. Hey, Stewart?","Stewart Glendinning","Mark.","Mark Hunter","You\u2019re back on.","Stewart Glendinning","Am I back on now? Okay. Well, hold on.","Mark Hunter","Yeah.","Stewart Glendinning","Kind of redial me in. So, cancel that thought. Okay. So just \u2013 if I can just answer that question. Sorry, I was talking and nobody could hear me. But obviously, two pieces to margin, Judy. The NSR which we were quite pleased with, I mean, was broadly in line with underlying trend in Q1, really was driven by the COGS. And if you looked at what happened in cost of goods sold in the second half, we broadly offset our inflation with cost savings, and the increase you see there was the increase in some of our marketing investments for impact promotions which go in case.","So that was investment behind the brands. You saw some impact from transactional effects and volume deleverage. But, I would look at the first half and say, if you looked at the first half, actually, we had an improvement in COGS of about 0.7%. So, hopefully that helps.","Judy Hong","Got it. Thank you.","Mark Hunter","Okay. Thank you, Stewart.","Judy Hong","Thank you.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Stewart. Thanks, Judy. Nicole, back to you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen. Your line is open.","Vivien Azer","Hi. Good morning.","Mark Hunter","Hi, Vivien.","Mauricio Restrepo","Hi, Vivien.","Vivien Azer","I was hoping to touch on the European segment please. While the positive net revenue per hectoliter is certainly encouraging, given what we\u2019ve seen over the course of 2015 per your comments, rate itself was negative. So, could you just offer a little bit more color on the pricing environment in Europe and whether there is any reason for optimism that the pricing outside of positive product or geographic mix could start to materialize? Thank you.","Mark Hunter","Okay. Thanks, Vivien. I\u2019m going to be hopeful here and suggest that Simon might be on the call. Simon, are you with us?","Simon Cox","I\u2019m speaking now. Hope you can hear me?","Mark Hunter","Yeah, we can. Thanks, Simon.","Simon Cox","Okay. Great. Yeah, okay. So, yes. I got the question. Thank you, Vivien. I mean, overall, we would characterize the European quarter as pretty solid and that sales revenue were up at 3%. What we\u2019re trying to do obviously is make sure that we\u2019ve got an appropriate balance between price and volume, or net NSR per hectoliter and volume, which, again, I think we achieved in the quarter. Volumes were up 1.6% and NSR per hectoliter at 1.3%. So, I think that\u2019s a reasonably good balance.","It is true that the NSR hectoliter is driven by mix with price under pressure. But that goes back to our premiumization strategy. We\u2019ve been trying to make sure that we invest behind the premium brands to drive the right \u2013 both portfolio and geographic mix.","So, whilst pricing is under pressure across many of the markets, I think we\u2019re doing a pretty solid job in recognizing that and driving volumes and shares and mix to get to an overall positive revenue growth. So, we\u2019ll be quite satisfied with it, recognizing that pricing remains competitive.","Vivien Azer","Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And just if I could follow-up on that.","Mark Hunter","Yes.","Vivien Azer","Thank you. In terms of the share gains that you\u2019re generating, those are in volume terms. But, do you have a sense of how your dollar share is trending? I\u2019m just curious whether this pricing pressure is true across the categories, or whether your pricing is under a little bit more pressure on an apples-to-apples basis.","Simon Cox","We don\u2019t believe that our pricing is under excessive pressure. Obviously, we\u2019ve got 11 markets that we have to cover, so it\u2019s very, very difficult to give you a sort of generic answer. But, we believe that our pricing and our volume is sort of in sensible collaboration. We took about 0.3% share across the region, and I don\u2019t think we sacrificed price in an uncontrolled way to do that.","So, I keep coming back to you, Vivien. It\u2019s important for us that we manage premiumization and mix, overall volume and share and overall pricing. And I think as long as we\u2019re getting overall net sales revenue growth like we have to \u2013 like we did do in the quarter end of 3%, we would be happy with that and think that\u2019s pretty solid.","Vivien Azer","Absolutely. Thank you very much.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Vivien. Nicole?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Mark Swartzberg","Yes. Thanks and good morning, everyone. One on Canada, Mark or Stewart, and another one on the global potential of some brands besides Coors Light. But on Canada, I think the takeaway here is that the spend increase is working. The share trends are improving. When you lift the hood, what gives you confidence, if you have it, that the upgrade in trend is sticky, so to speak. What are you seeing with brands and channels that makes you think that there won\u2019t be an issue three months from now?","Of course, the category is competitive, but trying to get a little better understanding of how much confidence we can have it will hold. And to the extent you can factor in July, appreciating that it\u2019s just one month of data, that would be helpful too. So, that\u2019s my question on Canada.","Mark Hunter","Mark, do you want to come back for the global question? And so, I\u2019ve asked Stewart to take that \u2013 to respond to that. Then if you come back on the global brand piece. So, Stewart, do you want...","Mark Swartzberg","Oh, sure. Sure enough.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. Sure, Mark. Yeah. Look. You probably did, just talking about our First Choice agenda just briefly and just saying that against the three platforms, we\u2019ve been driving \u2013 lowering our cost base, overhauling our supply chain network and improving the frontend. All three of those actually are looking good. On the first two, we continue to see cost savings in the quarter, and that allowed us to drive some of that brand investment that we put behind commercial.","And the money that we put behind commercial really went to three places. It went to invest behind our growing above premium portfolio, which has continued to grow share of beer. So, I think actually that\u2019s very sticky. Those brands have continued to grow and Coors Banquet turned in a better than 20% growth again this quarter.","I think the second piece is we put money behind our big brands relative to in-case promotions. And I think last year, we had some concerns that we weren\u2019t competitive. I think this year, we were well-balanced, and I think that was a positive.","And then on the third investment, we pushed investment behind our share of voice. We were under indexing. And together with really effective advertising copy, we\u2019ve seen that now continue to grow our brand scores. So, growing brand scores is a great tell-tale sign that you\u2019re spending money in the right place. So, that\u2019s how I\u2019d describe the brand expense for Q2.","Mark Swartzberg","That\u2019s great. Well, congratulations. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.","Stewart Glendinning","Cheers.","Mark Hunter","Mark, do you want to pick up your global question?","Mark Swartzberg","Oh, okay. I thought you were saying \u2013 that would be great. Yes. Thank you for that. Coors Light, I mean, plus 4% is a great number, and I think there\u2019s reasons to believe you can accelerate from there. So that in itself is something to draw attention to. But, you mentioned Staropramen. You mentioned Miller.","Could you give us a sense of where you think you are in the evolution specifically of Staropramen, how much potential you see here for the brand, in the U.S.? But more broadly, we see how it\u2019s helping you in Europe. Just trying to get a sense of how much it can start to deliver on the kind of performance we\u2019re seeing from Coors Light.","Mark Hunter","Yeah. So, if you look at the shape of our existing International portfolio, the two backbone brands are principally Coors Light and Staropramen. And clearly, Blue Moon is now in many, many markets globally, growing rapidly from a small base.","If you look at Staropramen specifically, post the StarBev acquisition, we increased investment in the brand really across Greater Europe, so outside of the Czech market, and we\u2019re seeing double-digit growth in many of those markets. My personal perspective is on a Greater Europe basis, there\u2019s still a lot of runway ahead of us.","And one of the changes I announced just in the last couple of weeks, Mark, is that we\u2019ll now look at our European business, including our export and license markets, and one of the benefits from that is we have a more holistic Europe approach across all markets on Staropramen.","I think outside of Europe, that\u2019s part of our thinking and our emerging planning ahead of integration. As Staropramen is currently in Canada, we\u2019re just going to \u2013 testing and incubating the brand there. The U.S. market was slightly more complex because of the distributor relationship or the importer relationship that we inherited when we acquired the StarBev business.","We\u2019re working our way through that and there\u2019s a broader conversation with Gavin and the team really looking at where we want to place our bets on our own portfolio going forward, recognizing that we\u2019re kind of \u2013 we have an embarrassment of Regis with Pilsner Urquell and Peroni and [indiscernible] Staropramen potentially in the future. So, that\u2019s work that we\u2019re currently thinking our way through just now.","But in terms of the heartland for Staropramen which is, let\u2019s call it, Greater Europe, very, very solid progress and Ukraine which is a really difficult market, we continue to take share there. So, I feel very good about the possibilities ahead for Staropramen as part of our kind of three-pronged International portfolio including addition of the Miller brand.","Mark Swartzberg","Fair enough. All right. Thank you, Mark.","Mark Hunter","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. Your line is open.","Rob Ottenstein","Great. Thank you very much. A couple of questions, first, pretty significant lowering in your CapEx guidance, I wonder if you could give us some color around that please?","Mark Hunter","Okay. Is that one of two questions, Robert?","Rob Ottenstein","Yes. I was going to hold back on the second.","Mark Hunter","Okay. So, Mauricio?","Mauricio Restrepo","Yes. Hi, Robert. How are you? So, the guidance we had previously given was CapEx of $300 million. We revised that down now to $220 million. The original guidance included the new plant in Vancouver and under the new guidance, we\u2019ve excluded that plant. So, the delta there will be $80 million, includes that plant plus some savings that we have on our annual CapEx plan.","Rob Ottenstein","Okay. And then what was the reason for excluding it now?","Mauricio Restrepo","Just to give you greater transparency in terms of what the CapEx would be excluding that, because it\u2019s obviously a very large CapEx project and we didn\u2019t want that number to be just offering all of the number, plus the proceeds of Vancouver are not in the free cash flow number.","Mark Hunter","Hey, Robert.","Rob Ottenstein","Okay. So, it\u2019s still going on. This is just basically a change in how you\u2019re describing what you\u2019re doing. There\u2019s no change in terms of the Vancouver plant.","Mauricio Restrepo","Absolutely. Exactly. That\u2019s correct.","Mark Hunter","Yeah, Robert, essentially, the new plant in Southern B.C. is largely but not completely probably is going to be funded by the proceeds from the sale of real estate from our Vancouver brewery. So, because the proceeds are excluded from free cash flow and CapEx and those types of numbers, we thought it would be fair to have sort of a comparable view on a CapEx guidance as well.","Rob Ottenstein","Got it. Got it. And then just a \u2013 I want to dig just a little bit more on the International brand potential. What if anything have you been able to accomplish in the last few months in terms of thinking through how you\u2019re going to go to market both in terms of route-to-market as well as manufacturing brewing infrastructure for the Miller global brands, and how quickly do you think you\u2019ll be able to move on that after the transaction closes?","Mark Hunter","Hey, Robert. It\u2019s Mark here. So, let me give you a couple of headlines and I think Kandy can fill in just a few of the details. I mean, just to reiterate, obviously, this is a significant step change opportunity for our International business. And I think as I\u2019ve indicated in the past, if you think about the Miller brands internationally, there\u2019s really kind of three volume platforms and value platforms. One is across our existing infrastructure. So, as I Indicated, we\u2019re looking forward to getting the Miller brands back into our portfolio in Canada, and obviously, the volumes in the UK and Ireland will roll into our existing business there.","The second platform is those markets where we already have route-to-markets and strong positions, and that will build those positions out further. So, for example, in Panama, our business, which is a strong Coors business, post that change in scale terms with the addition of the Miller brands, that\u2019ll open up a number of new markets where we currently don\u2019t have a route-to-market. And, Kandy, do you want to just talk about the progress that\u2019s been made, particularly on the second and third areas?","Kandy Anand","Thanks, Mark. Hi, Robert. So, it is very exciting for the International business and the Miller portfolio to an already fast-growing Coors Light portfolio which is growing strong double-digits.","In terms of the actual progress, if you take out our top 20 markets or the Miller brand that we are inheriting, including Canada, UK, Ireland, that basically covers 95%-plus of that total volume. On these large markets, we have either have agreements or we\u2019re in the process of getting agreements, to ensure), that we have a route-to-market on day one.","In terms of supply agreements, the combination of transition service agreements that we have previously negotiated with ABI post-transition or exporting from our U.S. business. So, those are our supply agreements. We made good progress. I mean, there is still a lot of work, a lot of countries, a lot of new markets. But, I would say at this point of time, we are on track for our day one integration.","Rob Ottenstein","That\u2019s...","Kandy Anand","Sorry, just to add...","Rob Ottenstein","Yeah.","Kandy Anand","...some of the transition agreements would be with \u2013 potentially with Asahi since they are taking over some of the European supply locations.","Rob Ottenstein","That\u2019s terrific. Do you have any sense of how the brands are doing this year? So the brands flat this year, up, down, any sense of order of magnitude?","Kandy Anand","Robert, it\u2019s a mixed bag, markets where brands doing quite well and has momentum, and there are others where it\u2019s down. So, I think as we look at the totality, they are more or less where we expected them to be based on the idea that we have which is, of course, quarter or later stage.","Mark Hunter","Yeah. Robert, it\u2019s Mark here. The thing I\u2019d ask you to bear in mind is clearly this is going to be a complex transition. I think we are well-planned and ready for execution. There\u2019s still some details to be sorted out. But I would actually think of it as very much in the medium-term to long-term basis.","As you think about the growth trajectory of our business, Coors, Miller and Staropramen combined along with our emerging International craft portfolio, if you look at over the course of the next few years, I think it places us in a very, very positive place to really build out our International footprint and our International trajectory. So, the first year will be challenging and tricky in some places, but got to look beyond that to \u2013 the value that\u2019s going to be created by the addition of the Miller International portfolio.","Rob Ottenstein","Terrific. And just one last question. Coors Light, you gave us, I think, a 4% global number. Can you tell us what it did in Canada specifically and then what it did outside of North America, please?","Mark Hunter","Off the top of my head, in Canada, we were down kind of low- to mid-single digits. And then internationally, if you look at our MCI business, we were up double-digit growth. And in the UK and Ireland, we were up double-digits, in fact, kind of high-20%s, low-30% growth. So, Canada, down low- to mid-single; everywhere else outside of Canada, double-digit growth.","Rob Ottenstein","Okay. And any visibility in terms of stabilization in Canada?","Mark Hunter","Well, I think Stewart picked up on that. The focus has been on driving the right input which had an impact on the output. And I\u2019m certainly very encouraged and I know the teammate are by the fact that we\u2019ve seen our brand health metrics and our purchase intent numbers move in a very positive direction through the second quarter.","So, any quality of our copy, the promotional intensity in terms of our in-case, the roll out of the visual identity, further alignment with the U.S. creative platform, all of those things are very well. But this is a big, big brand and you don\u2019t turn things on or turn things off overnight. So, we are working this hard, and I think we\u2019re working on the right input measures, starting certainly through our brand tracking to demonstrate that we\u2019re pulling on the right levers, and I expect to see performance improve through the balance of this year and into 2017.","Encouragingly, when you look at Coors\u2019 trademark in totality, in Canada, and adding Banquet, which Stewart mentioned, is up over 20% again in the month. With the Coors trademarks in generally good health, Coors Light, if we can get that moving in the right direction will be in a very strong position.","Rob Ottenstein","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Robert.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.","Brett Cooper","Good morning. Just a quick question. There\u2019s a push for now in the law called beer. Just wondering kind of what your thoughts are on the opportunity there? Kind of where you sit today as you go through some of your major markets?","Mark Hunter","Hi, Brett, I think that question was around no and low alcohol beers?","Brett Cooper","Yeah. So that\u2019s something which has already been a relatively large part of our thinking within Molson Coors and one of the benefits when we acquired the StarBev business was actually the addition of the beer mix portfolio to our portfolio.","So commonly described as radlers, these are beers run about 2% alcohol. So, we\u2019ve got, I think, some good learning in our business about the consumer drivers line low and no alcohol and is a central innovation point within our business, so more to follow. I think many people in alcohol are now looking at low and no alcohol choices. It\u2019s very much one of our agenda. And there will be news on that front in due course.","Brett Cooper","Thanks.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Brett. [Operator Instructions]","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan Spillane","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Mark Hunter","Hi, Bryan.","Mauricio Restrepo","Hello, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","I\u2019ve got two questions. One related to interest rates and the other related to reporting. So, I guess the first one just on interest rates, with interest rates, I guess post Brexit, the outlook, it looks like it\u2019s even lower. It\u2019s going to stay low for a long time. So Mauricio, could you just sort of talk to us about any effect that might potentially have on things like pension funding, assumptions that you\u2019re using for pension funding.","And then also how it might affect the way you apply the PACC model, just simply because the cost of financing or cost of capital come done, does it sort of change it all the way you\u2019re planning, you apply the PACC model in looking at certain projects?","Mauricio Restrepo","Yes. Thank you, Bryan. Look, I mean, in terms of our financing, first of all, obviously, as you heard me say before, we had a fantastic result in our long-term debt offering. The interest cost that we were able to get on the financing was about $200 million lower than what we had assumed in the pro forma financials that we had submitted a couple of months ago. So, that clearly will have a very beneficial impact going forward.","And as for the PACC model, of course, we\u2019re constantly updating the cost of capital that we would use to analyze and review the various alternatives, i.e. should we delever, should we invest behind our brands, or should we pursue certain M&A opportunities, or should we return money to shareholders. And obviously those rates will be adjusted and are adjusted accordingly, given what\u2019s happening in the market and our outlook going forward.","Bryan Spillane","And then just on pensions, I guess as you\u2019re contemplating the merger of MillerCoors and Molson Coors and just looking at your pension assumptions, is there anything that we should be watching out for there, again, related to the interest rate outlook being lower for longer, probably?","Mauricio Restrepo","Well, as you know, I mean, that tends to have a double effect on the one hand because of the returns that you have on the pension assets and also the discount rate that you use for the obligations.","But at present, I mean, those things have been taken into account in terms of the guidance that we\u2019ve given; and again, where our defined benefit pension plans, we think that the cash contributions will be in the order of between $45 million to $65 million this year and the expense of around $17 million, and that includes the 42% of our MillerCoors contribution and expense. Obviously, that will be updated going forward for 100%","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then just one last one on financial reporting. I think at the Investor Day, you kind of walked through how you\u2019ll give us a little bit better visibility in terms of the transaction-related reporting. I think this spring the SEC had, I guess, made some rulings or statements about just sort of, I guess, more scrutiny on non-GAAP disclosures and maybe auditing it or scrutinizing it a little bit more. So, can you just \u2013 is there anything that we should think about in terms of your plans for the transaction-related reporting relative to kind of what the SEC has been commenting on?","Mark Hunter","Well, look, I mean on the one hand, what you\u2019re saying is absolutely right. The SEC has revised their position in terms of GAAP versus non-GAAP disclosures, and we obviously are following in line with that as are many other companies, many other public companies in the U.S. And what that means is that in the 10-Ks and the 10-Qs, you will not now see some of the underlying measures that we used to put in there before.","As for the information that you would receive post transaction, obviously, that\u2019s information that you are going to receive through our calls, and we\u2019ll still refer to those metrics because we think that they can give the investors and the analysts a very good indication of how our business is performing.","And just to recap what we had mentioned to you at the New York Analysts Conference is that post the transaction close, we will be referring to a new number of updated synergies and cost savings. We are also going to talk about the transaction pro forma adjusted EPS. And we\u2019re also going to talk about the cash flow-generating ability of the new business going forward.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Mark Hunter","Sure, Bryan.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Mark Hunter","Okay. Well, if there are no questions, I\u2019d just like to thank everybody for your interest in Molson Coors Brewing Company. We are poised, as we look forward, to the hopeful conclusion of the ABI and SAB transaction and our acquisition of the 58% in MillerCoors, which will be transformational for our business.","So, I\u2019m sure everybody will be tuned in over the coming months as that comes to culmination. Thank you for your interest, and we look forward to see many of you shortly in Boston at the conference at the beginning of September. Thanks for your interest today, everybody.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect."],"14679":["Molson Coors Brewing (NYSE:TAP) Q4 2012 Earnings Call February 14, 2013 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Peter S.

Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period in U.S. dollars.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Swinburn, President and CEO of Molson Coors.","Peter S. Swinburn","Thank you, Jay. Hello, and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call. Thank you for joining us. With me on the call this morning are Gavin Hattersley, Molson Coors' CFO; Stewart Glendinning, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors Europe; Kandy Anand, CEO of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors Chief Legal and People Officer; Zahir Ibrahim, Molson Coors' Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors' VP of Investor Relations.","Mark and Stewart's new roles are related to the restructuring we initiated last fall, which combined our U.K. and Ireland businesses with our new Central Europe organization to create a single European business as of January 1, 2013.","On the earnings call today, Gavin and I will take you through highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some initial perspectives on 2013.","In the fourth quarter, our worldwide volume and net sales increased due to the addition of our Central Europe business. Underlying after-tax income declined 28%, driven by a higher tax rate and cycling strong quarterly results the year before, which included an additional week in our fiscal 2011 and some other onetime factors that did not repeat in 2012. Gavin will provide additional details on the fourth quarter performance in a few minutes.","For the full year 2012, the biggest news was the acquisition of our Central Europe business, which we expect to strengthen our company, enhance our growth profile and increase shareholder value in the years ahead. We have begun implementing plans to capture synergies, leverage best practices and pay down debt related to buying this new business.","This acquisition helped our 2012 worldwide volume grow by 14%, net sales by more than 11% and underlying earnings per share by 4%. In addition, Molson Coors generated $865 million of underlying free cash flow, up nearly 40% from 2011.","In 2012, we continued to focus on the 3 pillars of our growth strategy, namely: to grow profitably in our core businesses through brands and innovation; to grow in new and emerging markets; and, when it meets our strict shareholder return criteria, to grow through M&A. As in previous years, the first of these pillars was our primary focus as we continued to invest in key brands and fill our innovation pipeline.","In 2012, Coors Light grew market share in the U.S., U.K. and including Ice T, in Canada. And our premium craft portfolios in the U.S. and Canada outperformed the industry and grew market share.","In Canada, during 2012, we achieved positive price and brand mix. We strengthened our above-premium portfolio by introducing Rickard's Cardigan and Oakhouse seasonal brands and by acquiring the licenses for the Newcastle Brown Ale and Strongbow Cider brands. We also launched Aluminum Pint bottles for Coors Light and Molson Canadian.","In the U.S., Coors Light significantly outperformed the premium light segment and posted its eighth consecutive year of growth. We completed the relaunch of Miller 64 and rolled out Leinenkugel's Lemon Berry Shandy and Batch 19. Also, in above-premium, we expanded Henry Weinhard's brands nationally and tested Redd's Apple Ale and Third Shift. The Blue Moon and Leinenkugel's brands continued to lead the craft beer segment with double-digit growth.","We also purchased the Crispin Cider Company, which gives us brands in the fast-growing U.S. cider category. And we continue to work hard to improve volume trends for Miller Lite.","In a very challenging U.K. beer market, we now have 2 of the fastest-growing premium brands in Coors Light and Doom Bar. We also introduced Carling Zest with the launch being recognized as the best of the year in the U.K. by ACNielsen.","In Central Europe, we delivered a strong competitive performance in a tough trading environment with share and pricing growth in our key markets, accelerated innovation performance driven by beer mixes, Staropramen growth in double digits in 2012 and strict overhead cost management.","On a full year basis, we took the market share leadership position in Bulgaria, we grew share in Croatia to its highest level for the past 10 years, and achieved strong volume growth and record on-premise share in the Czech Republic. We recorded solid share growth in all of our major markets in 2012 apart from Romania, where we gave up volume share in the thin-margin value segment.","In our second growth pillar, our International business drove improved financial performance in the fourth quarter as it began liquidating its underperforming China joint venture, restructured its Coors Light business in the rest of China, improved performance in Japan and integrated the Central Europe license and export businesses.","In M&A, the Central Europe integration has gone well. We are on schedule to capture the committed $50 million of cost and revenue synergies, and we are leveraging important processes and commercial learnings from this business globally. The addition of this business provided more than $17 million of pretax earnings accretion in 2012 on an underlying basis and net of related interest expenses.","Beyond our growth pillars, we have consistently said that in addition to growing our brands, we would aggressively drive costs out of our business. In 2012, our Resources -- full Resources for Growth program delivered $74 million in savings, allowing us to close out this 3-year program with total savings of $200 million, which is $50 million higher than our original goal.","Our share of MillerCoors results added another $46 million of cost savings.","And in the area of corporate social responsibility, Molson Coors was selected as the 2012\/2013 global beverage sector leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, which is the most recognized global benchmark of sustainability among global corporations.","With this as an overview of 2012, I'll turn it over to Gavin to get fourth quarter financial highlights and perspective on 2013. Gavin?","Christien Coors Ficeli","Thank you, Peter, and hello, everybody. Molson Coors' fourth quarter underlying after-tax earnings decreased 28.4% to $126.1 million or $0.69 per share. The decline in results was driven by weak economic conditions and challenging prior year comparisons in all of our businesses.","Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors increased more than 15% due to the addition of Central Europe results and strong Coors Light growth in all of our core markets. On a pro forma basis, including Central Europe in 2011, worldwide volume decreased 7% for the quarter, driven by lower volume in the U.K, Canada, Central Europe and international.","Canada and U.K. declines were partially attributable to starting the 53rd week in our 2011 fiscal year.","Regionally, lower volume translates into lower underlying profit performance.","Results of this quarter were in line with expectations, and we continue to pursue additional sources of top line and bottom line growth, which we will discuss in a few minutes.","Now a reminder about how we are presenting our results for our new Central Europe business and Molson Coors International. In order to provide the most useful information, we will discuss Central Europe results this year in comparison to pro forma results for the comparable prior year period. Also, our International group is managing the exports and license business for our Central Europe brands.","As we have in previous quarters, I will provide an overview of our results with MillerCoors presented as if it were proportionately consolidated. This is a non-GAAP approach, but we believe it provides a useful view of some key performance metrics for our business.","On this basis, total company net sales increased 6.3% in the fourth quarter, driven by the addition of the Central Europe business along with growth in the United States. Net sales per hectoliter decreased 5.4% in the quarter due to the addition of Central Europe sales with lower net sales per hectoliter, which more than offset solid pricing in the U.S., Central Europe, Canada and internationally.","Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 2.1% due to the addition of Central Europe, which has a lower cost structure than our other segments.","Total company gross margin was 37.5%, 210 basis points lower than a year ago due to the impact of fixed-cost deleverage related to lower volume, higher input inflation, onetime margins that did not repeat and increased pension costs primarily in Canada and the U.K. These negative impacts were partially offset by margin expansion of 90 basis points in the U.S.","Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 5.5% due to the addition of Central Europe results and increased investments in brands and business transformation by MillerCoors.","Underlying operating margin was 11%, down 200 basis points from a year ago, driven by substantially the same factors as those affecting gross margins.","Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.","It is important to note that our fourth quarter underlying results exclude some special and other noncore gains, losses and expenses that net to a $25.4 million pretax charge. Underlying results also exclude a $38.3 million noncash charge for the tax effect of a Serbian statutory corporate income tax rate increase.","The pretax adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results primarily relate to Central Europe, acquisitions, financing and restructuring charges in the U.K. and Canada, and they are described in detail in this morning's earnings release.","Underlying free cash flow for 2012 totaled $865 million, which exceeded our previous estimate for the year of $750 million by $115 million largely due to improvements in year-over-year working capital management. This $246 million increase over the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in operating cash flow due to the addition of Central Europe and working capital improvements.","Our 2012 cash generation was made up of the following factors: $984 million of operating cash flow, which includes $511 million from MillerCoors, plus $170 million of net addbacks to Central Europe acquisition-related costs, restructuring payments and MillerCoors' purchases of businesses and other assets. Investing cash outflows were $222 million in capital spending and $66 million of cash invested in MillerCoors.","Total debt at the end of 2012 was $4.67 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $624 million, resulting in net debt of $4 billion, approximately $60 million lower than 3 months earlier.","Looking forward to 2013, our annual target for underlying free cash flow is $700 million, plus or minus 10%. This goal is $165 million lower than our 2012 result because of 3 factors: higher capital spending and cash interest, primarily related to having our Central Europe business for the full year; higher cash taxes in 2013; and an increase of about $50 million in our total pension contributions. Currently, we anticipate approximately $150 million of cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2013 and pension expense of about $50 million, both including 42% of MillerCoors.","Our 2013 capital spending outlook is approximately $330 million, up from $222 million last year largely because we will have a full year Central Europe capital expenditure.","We expect our 2013 MG&A expense in Corporate to be approximately $105 million.","Our consolidated net interest expense outlook for 2013 is approximately $170 million.","We expect our 2013 effective tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 20%, assuming no further changes in tax laws. Our 2012 underlying rate was 18%. We continue to see our long-term tax rate to be in a range of 20% to 24%, but we anticipate that it will take a few years to move to that range.","As far as our cost outlook is concerned, in Canada for 2013, we expect our cost of goods sold to increase at a mid-single-digit rate per hectoliter in local currency. In the United States, we expect MillerCoors' cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a low single-digit rate for the full year 2013.","In Europe, which now combines the U.K. with Central Europe, we anticipate a low single-digit increase in pro forma cost of goods sold per hectoliter this year in local currency. Our International business anticipates cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a low single-digit rate for the full year.","At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for regional outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Peter?","Peter S. Swinburn","Thanks, Gavin. So in Canada, we are pleased to see the return of hockey. But due to the short lead time, we'll be unable to affect full retail activation until the fall. We expect our 2 lead brands in Canada to benefit from the renewed drive behind our innovative Aluminum Pint bottle and our new Molson Canadian advertising that went viral prior to its TV launch. We also -- we will also continue to transfer our craft beers to new regions following the success of Granville Island in Ontario last year.","In the U.S., we will be developing our portfolio in the above-premium and craft and working to gain share in premium lights. We are planning new line extensions for Leinenkugels and Blue Moon for fall -- for summer and fall.","In above-premium, we're also launching Redd's Apple Ale and Third Shift. In premium lights, we're investing behind new commercial properties, including multicultural for Coors Light and Miller Lite, and we'll also launch a new Miller Lite bottle in the on-premise.","In Europe, we delivered a strong competitive performance in a tough trading environment with market share and pricing growth in all our major markets with the exception of the U.K. and Romania. We also accelerated innovation performance driven by beer mixes, strong Staropramen growth and strict overhead cost management.","The restructuring to combine our U.K. and Ireland businesses with Central Europe has gone smoothly, enabling additional European cost savings to be delivered in 2013.","In Hungary, we have stabilized and restructured the business under new leadership. And in Romania, which is our lowest share major market in the region, we have introduced new leadership, added sales resources, dealt with inventory overstocks and refocused the portfolio on higher-value segments.","In the U.K, Carling-produced cider will be hitting off-premise retailer shelves next month. We are investing in new platforms for Carling to strengthen its position and enhance its performance on the bar.","In the craft space, we have purchased the Franciscan Well brand and micro-brewery in Cork City, Republic of Ireland, to build a strong share in that craft beer market.","Across Europe, in 2013, we will be increasing the scale of innovation and accelerating sales and marketing investment to strengthen our mainstream and premium portfolio across all major markets to drive the top line and bottom line.","Our International business continues to focus on growth and is investing ahead of the curve in emerging markets behind a solid portfolio of Coors Light, Carling, Staropramen and Blue Moon. We anticipate that the liquidation of the China joint venture and the restructuring of the Coors Light business in the balance of China will reduce the underlying loss for this business in 2013.","Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the first quarter. In Canada, our sales-to-retail for the first 4 weeks of the quarter increased at a mid-single-digit rate versus 2012 primarily due to year-over-year differences in the timing of pricing and promotional activity.","In the U.S., for the first 4 weeks ended January 26, STRs were down low single digits. In Europe, our sales volume increased at a high single-digit rate for the first month of the quarter, driven partially by year-over-year differences in the timing of price increases. And in the first 4 weeks, our international STRs increased at a double-digit rate on a comparable basis. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead.","To summarize our discussion today, lower fourth quarter underlying earnings were driven by a higher tax rate and cycling strong quarterly results the year before, including the 53rd week in our fiscal 2012 and some other onetime factors. Full year results included higher underlying earnings and $865 million of underlying free cash flow generation.","Our Central Europe business is being integrated very effectively and, in a different retail environment -- in a difficult retail environment, is performing very well.","In 2013, our focus will continue to be on the 3 pillars of our growth strategy and particularly the first one, which is to grow profitably in our core businesses with brands and innovation. We also intend to pay down debt. In combination with disciplined, high-return cash use, our growth strategy is designed to drive long-term profit, cash flow and total return to our shareholders.","Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 2 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.","And so at this point, Jay, we'd like to open it up to questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess I just wanted to get a little bit more color on Central and Eastern Europe. I think you've talked about some of the competitive dynamics in some markets. But broadly speaking, kind of what are you seeing from a macro perspective for the category as a whole? A little bit more color in terms of the markets where you're gaining share, what you're doing differently in those markets. And then just the profit decline in the fourth quarter was also a little bit surprising to me in Central Europe. So kind of from a profitability perspective, if you can help to understand what drove the decline in the quarter.","Peter S. Swinburn","Sure. So Judy, I think I'll take the first part of the question, and I'll pass the second part on to Mark to give you the sort of granularity. I think really, we covered it off in the script. I mean, on a relative basis, this business is performing exceptionally well. As I said, we've taken market share in Bulgaria. You asked why. I mean, obviously, that's down to execution and the strength of our brands. We've got the highest market share ever in Croatia, and we've got activity coming forward there that we're very pleased about in terms of new bottles. Czech Republic, we've gained share in a difficult on-trade market and doing well generally in that market. We've grown share in every single market, apart from Romania, and Mark can speak to that in a second. And we've got double-digit growth in Staropramen, which is our -- I would say our core brand in that -- sorry, our core above-premium brand in that market. So overall, that's a very strong set in a relative difficult environment. So overall, very pleased with it. Because the results have some detail and which need explaining, so I'll pass it now over to Mark. And Mark, maybe you can make reference to what's going on in Romania as well.","Mark Hunter","Sure. Thanks, Peter. Judy, just a couple of builds on Peter's comments, and I'll talk specifically about the fourth quarter. I mean, I think on the Q3 call, I was very clear about the fact that we're seeing, certainly from a GDP perspective, lower growth rates than we're anticipating, and that's having a direct impact on overall beer consumption. And in fact, on a full year basis overall, there were only really 2 markets that showed any volume growth, the Romanian market and the Bulgarian market. And as Peter said, we've taken market leadership in Bulgaria, which is great news. In Romania, I mentioned in Q3 that most of the growth in that market was coming in the very low-margin value segment. We chose not to participate in Q3, and we've continued not participating through the fourth quarter, with our focus really being on our core brands and our premium brands because we believe that will give the business long-term sustainability. We actually look at the specific profit numbers in the fourth quarter. In local currency, we were down about 5%. So we've been running the business now for 2 quarters. We posted strong growth in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we're down 5% in local currency. And I took 2 decisions through the fourth quarter which impacted on that. It was clear, as the business left 2011, a significant stock had been pushed into the market in both Romania and Serbia, and I took a decision to de-stock the distribution pipeline. And that cost us in profit terms a couple of million euros. So if you actually add that back on to our Q4 numbers, then it gives us a much more solid position in the fourth quarter. And it sets us up for, I think, all of the right behaviors and actions as we move into 2013, building on the back of what has been share growth in every one of our major markets, with the exception being the Romanian market for the reason I've described. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color to both the profit number and just some of the volume trends.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. So -- and then just in terms of Europe, so can -- is the savings you could be getting from the integration of the U.K., Ireland and then, I guess, perhaps the further savings, Europe broadly consolidating between U.K. and the Central and Eastern Europe, can you quantify potential savings, how meaningful that could be over time?","Peter S. Swinburn","We will, when we update everybody at the next analyst call, Judy, which is what we promised at the last quarter. We're still in consultation in Europe. We have to go through certain regulatory hoops in terms of doing restructuring. So that consultation won't be completed until the end of March. So we're not in a position to give final details. But you can see some of the specials that we've highlighted in our earnings results this morning. So that should give you some idea or some guidance but not in so many specific numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping you could review the competitive environment in Canada, particularly in the West, and the impact on your business potentially from the Qu\u00e9bec excise tax increases.","Stewart F. Glendinning","Sure, Dara. Stew, here. Just -- I'll take those separately. I mean, certainly, as we look at Qu\u00e9bec, 20% increase in taxes there will have a negative effect. And certainly, we saw it in the latter part of the fourth quarter. Difficult to say precisely what that impact is. But as price goes up, consumers will buy less. I think when you look at the West, the dynamic is different there. It's a competitive dynamic. A couple of things in play. So first, the smaller brewers have continued to extend in 2 markets there, one in the value space, where value has grown quite dramatically, and then particularly in the craft space. We're competing in both of those spaces with Keystone at the value end and with Granville Island and, to a lesser extent in the West, with Creemore at the top end. There's also -- we've seen in the West perhaps some more aggressive innovation, which came earlier in last year, which -- from competitors, which we saw coming earlier last year, which sort of flowed through the year. And if we look out to this year, we think we've got a very exciting innovation pipeline, and we're well positioned to play in the market.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then the mid-single-digit January growth in the STRs, that's a very strong rebound in Canada. But you mentioned some timing benefits. So can you give me a sense of kind of a more normalized underlying trend?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Yes, I -- we can't really give any guidance there. But I would say that the mid-single-digit rate that you see there is not reflective of the market fundamentals, and that is largely down to the timing of promotional activities and customer buy-in. So I would -- that's the best answer I can give you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ian Shackleton with Nomura.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Two questions. So just clarifying what I think what Peter said. On Canada, the comment was made that, if I understood correctly, that you'd expect market share to be covering by the fall after the hockey change. I just wanted to clarify if I got that right. And equally, on the International business, was the comment made that the losses will be small in 2013? We're not expecting a return to profits that we saw in Q4?","Peter S. Swinburn","All right. So on Canada, Ian, what I said was that we wouldn't be able to fully activate the NHL sponsorship at the retail end until the fall because, obviously, the lead times you need with retailers and so on means that we can't put it into place some -- in sort of first half of the year. So it wasn't the market share position, it was specifically the activation against the NHL property. And yes, you were right in terms of the International business. The -- what we said was the loss would be reduced.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I mean, is it going to be fairly substantial? I mean, are we talking about the halving of the loss you had this year for 2012?","Peter S. Swinburn","The loss will be reduced, yes. I think that's as much as we can tell you, Ian.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just want to follow up a little bit on Dara's question in terms of Canada. And your answer there, it sounds as though, I guess, it's shipments coming in a little bit earlier. So do you think you'll be able to be positive for the quarter in terms of STRs given the strong start you had, even if it's taking volume out of the rest of the quarter? And then the second question I have...","Unknown Executive","Well, let's answer the first piece. I just -- I don't -- we can't give you guidance for the first quarter. I just want to draw attention to the fact that I think the number that you're seeing there is not reflective of the true market fundamentals. Some of the increase we, no doubt, will get are around hockey, for example. I mean, hockey didn't get going right until the end of January. So that's not a big influence here in the number. I just -- as we release that number, I'd like you to just make sure you understand what some of the drivers are.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then moving on to the tax rate. It's one of the things where you guys talk about the long-term tax rate and eventually it's going to go there. It hasn't moved. And in fact, because of some of things you've done, the tax rate generally has been lower. What's the right way to think about the progression on that? Is -- when it finally starts to move, is it a slow buildup over time? Is it a one-shot deal? How should we think about that in terms of longer term?","Gavin Hattersley","John, I would not characterize it as a one-jump deal, I think, you referred to. I think it's going to be a slow progression over time. And as I said on the call, it'll take us a few years to get there.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So 2 questions. One, first, just in terms of the hockey season this year, given the strike and the lack of ability to fully merchandise against it, do you get any rebate or any insurance? Is there any remuneration you get for not being able to fully merchandise against it?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Bryan, it sounds like you've been at a good hockey game. But I will say that we work -- clearly, one of the drivers in the fourth quarter was a reduction in some of our marketing expense related to activation around hockey, but we haven't been specific about what those numbers are that -- since that agreement is confidential.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So that is -- that's not necessarily just not spending. That is getting some sort of remuneration for it, I guess, is what I was trying to get after?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Yes, I can't get into any more detail, I'm sorry. But all of that stuff is reflected in total in our marketing spend. And so I guess my argument would be it doesn't really matter which side it comes from.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, I guess what I was -- as we're looking at modeling to the back half of 2013, were you -- we should be looking at more significant increases in marketing just because you've got an abnormally low level in the fourth quarter? I guess that's what...","Stewart F. Glendinning","I would say that, that is true in the fourth quarter. We had an unusually low level in the fourth quarter. But again, we also had much lower volumes. So we would naturally take those kinds of steps.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right, right. Understood. And then just a second question more broadly. We've had a couple of big acquisitions on the tape this morning. And just in general, given the low financing environment, it just seems like it's a market that's pretty conducive to M&A. I know that you're still digesting StarBev, but just -- could you just talk more broadly about kind of what your perspective is on M&A, on the environment, your willingness to look at things today?","Peter S. Swinburn","Sure. As you said, since we did the StarBev acquisition, we're very focused on paying down debt and maintaining our investment grade. So that really is what we're focused on. If there is some small infills in terms of portfolio fills or whatever, we would be interested and would look at that. But if you're talking about major M&A activity, that's not something that's on our agenda in the short term.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we have no further questions at this time. I turn the call back to the presenters.","Peter S. Swinburn","Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for participating. And I look forward to speaking to you again at the end of the next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Now, I will turn the call over to Dave Dunnewald. Global Vice President of Investor Relations for Molson Coors.","Dave Dunnewald","Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our 2015 earnings follow-up earnings conference call. Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible, following our earnings regular conference call with Mark Hunter, David Heede, and our business unit CEOs earlier today. We will use a standard question-and-answer format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour.","Before we begin, I will paraphrase the Company's Safe Harbor language. Some of the discussions today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the Company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings, for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. The Company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the day they are made.","Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time to time by the Company's executives in discussing our performance, please visit the Company's website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the financial reporting tab of the Investor Relations page, for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the Company discusses are versus the comparable prior-year period, and in U.S. dollars. We also encourage investors and analysts to read SABMiller PLC news releases and trading statements that include financial and other information relating to the MillerCoors joint venture.","So let's get started with an introduction of the team with me on the call today. We have Kevin Kim, Investor Relations Senior Manager; Ashley Dunlop, Finance Forecasting Senior Manager; Brian Tabolt, Controller; Mike Rumley, Treasurer; and Mark Saks, VP of Tax. And we also have a special cameo appearance from David Heede, Interim Global CFO.","Regarding quarterly results, as Mark Hunter mentioned on our regular earnings call this morning, the most important strategic development for Molson Coors in 2015 was the definitive agreement we reached late in the year, to purchase the other 58% of MillerCoors that we do not currently own, along with the international rights to the Miller brand. Beyond this game-changing transaction for our Company, we are pleased with the overall progress that our Company made in 2015. We exceeded our targets for cash generation and cost savings, and expanded gross margins and underlying pretax margins globally.","We grew our above-premium craft FMB and cider business globally, gained share in the key premium light segment in the U.S., and accelerated the growth of our international business, including a bolt-on acquisition in the fast-growing India market. In 2016, we will continue to focus on building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, investing behind the strength of our core brand positions, and continuing to premiumize the portfolio.","So with that, we would now like to open it up for your questions. Over to you, Lori.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Ian Shackleton of Nomura. Your line is open.","Ian Shackleton","The question really around modeling for this year, and I know it's a tricky thing, because we don't quite know when the MillerCoors deal will complete sometime in H2. Clearly, you've got a lot of shares that you've issued and I'm just thinking when you report Q1 and probably Q2, which will before the deal completes, you're going to have a lot more shares issued, you're going to have more cash on the balance sheet. I guess we should be modeling that through, because clearly, it's got a dilutive on that in the short term, or is there something I am missing on that?","Dave Dunnewald","Right. You have nearly 30 million additional shares now in the marketplace, so that does have implications for any calculation that includes shares. In the meantime, right, we have significant cash on our balance sheet, and we'll obviously handle that cash in the best interest of our shareholders. But I think you're thinking about the right pieces.","Ian Shackleton","Okay. My understanding, and certainly this is possibly only for IFRS accounting, which I know is not applicable to you, but if there is additional debt funding being taken like ABI has, you might be able to capitalize if you want the carry costs until the deal completes. But it's different for you, isn't it, because you've issued the shares, and you can't really calculate a carry cost, I guess?","Dave Dunnewald","I don't know a way to calculate the carry costs, except for the dividends associated with the additional shares, which you would want to take those into account.","Operator","Your next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan Spillane","Just a couple of modeling questions. First, just to follow up on Ian's question now about the shares and the dividend, your free cash flow guidance is before or after dividends?","Dave Dunnewald","The free cash flow does not include dividends.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And the dividend, I know it's a stub, but the dividend is going to be just a lot higher, right, because of the extra shares that are out there? The cash dividend.","Dave Dunnewald","We'll pay about nearly 30% more dividend specifically related to issuing the additional shares.","Bryan Spillane","Right.","Dave Dunnewald","And we -- that's not on top of, but it's also important to note that we have said that we will maintain the same dividend at, what do you call it, same dividend as cash per share quarterly amount.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. It will make the cash flow between now and the time the deal closes, it's just going to eat up a little more cash flow. It will definitely have a dampening effect on the cash flow?","Dave Dunnewald","Well, it will be essentially, to call it simple math, would be additional dividends minus whatever interest income we earn on those cash balances, in anticipation of closing the transaction.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, and then the next question, just on the interest expense expectation that you gave, ex MillerCoors, is that also net of whatever income you're expecting from the proceeds that are hung up on the balance sheet now?","Dave Dunnewald","The interest expense and the other guidance metrics that we gave you on the earlier call are all excluding any impacts from the pending MillerCoors transaction.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. So the interest that you're going to earn, that you should earn on the cash that you're holding onto now is not netted against that $110 million guidance?","Dave Dunnewald","That's correct.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. So what we will see, I guess, just thinking, you should earn interest in the first quarter that would help negatively offset some of that expense, right?","Dave Dunnewald","Yes, some of it. As you know, short-term interest rates are still very, very low, but we'll definitely do our best for our shareholders on that.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. No, based on the Bank of America stock price, it seems like interest rates are going to stay low forever. Okay. And then just in terms of the, there's some items -- I just want to get some clarification on some of the items that were puts and takes to 2015 and how they wraparound to 2016. So for instance, in terms of the lost licenses in Canada, the Miller brand, that goes -- when does that completely anniversary?","Dave Dunnewald","March of 2016. End of March. We'll have a bit of a comparison issue there in the first quarter, although it's a relatively small quarter, but nonetheless, a bit of a comparison challenge there, specifically related to that contract, and then that's it.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, and then the other ones, just in terms -- I'm just trying to make sure that I capture the stuff that wraps around. That's the most meaningful one that will affect 2016?","Dave Dunnewald","Right. We've cycled all the other contracts already.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, okay. And then in the $50 million to $70 million of cost savings that you talked about for the next two years, does that include the benefit from closing -- like you did a brewery closing in the UK. Does it also at all -- I guess Vancouver hasn't happened yet. I'm just trying to understand is that, like how much of that $50 million to $70 million includes the wrap-around benefit for some of the things that occurred in 2016, or is that all truly incremental to what's already in motion?","Dave Dunnewald","Well, one of our cost savings initiatives spread over multiple years, particularly as they pertain to things like supply chain, sometimes procurement. What I would say is the $50 million to $70 million isn't, call it, increased results from, call it, additional or upsized cost savings initiatives, and it would -- essentially the $50 million to $70 million would include all of our cost savings that we expect to achieve in the next couple of years outside of MillerCoors and outside of the MillerCoors transaction.","Bryan Spillane","Okay and then just the last one, just pension expense, I didn't quite catch it on the call. The incremental pension expense in 2016 versus 2015?","Dave Dunnewald","So the pension expense number, approximately $17 million, down from $40 million in 2015, and that's a funded status of about 97%, so call it the gap, if you will, is only about $160 million on a $4 billion-plus base. And if we're looking for cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, we're anticipating $45 million to $65 million in 2016, down from a much higher number of $250 million, because we are not planning to make a discretionary contribution to our UK plans this year, as we did last year. I would hasten to add that includes -- both of those numbers I gave you, actually all of them, are related to pensions, includes our 42% of MillerCoors pension.","Bryan Spillane","And maybe just one last one related to pensions, and I'll turn it over. Just when you merge, when Miller -- assuming that MillerCoors and Molson Coors merge, is there any pension remeasurement that happens at MillerCoors, that would either cause a step-up in cash or a step-up in expense?","Dave Dunnewald","There may be some adjustments that need to be done related to purchase accounting, but I'm not going to speculate on what those would do at this point.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen. Your line is open.","Vivien Azer","So I just wanted to follow up on Bryan's question in terms of just a phasing of different cash items. So when you offered your preliminary guidance for the fourth quarter a couple weeks ago, you raised the free cash flow target because of benefits from working capital, both for Molson Coors as well as MillerCoors. How do we think about that going forward? Does that need to unwind?","Dave Dunnewald","So I guess the main point there is the free cash flow upside versus our original guidance was not -- did not have significant timing, call it, differences or timing effect in it between 2015 and 2016.","Vivien Azer","Okay. Perfect. Perfect. That's helpful. Is there anything else that you want to call out from a lapping perspective?","Dave Dunnewald","Related to working capital? You mean related?","Vivien Azer","Yes, distribution.","Dave Dunnewald","I would say that a couple of things. We did do some small bolt-on transactions in 2015. Not going to try to predict what might be -- what we might be doing in 2016, but you need to be aware of that. You do have the higher dividends, which we talked about earlier, and working capital, you probably recall. We had particularly three main years, 2012, 2013 and 2014, where we had some major working capital projects going on, and really had some nice results. And we continue to work on working capital, reducing our working capital, but it does become somewhat more difficult over time to come up with additional improvements in working capital. But you can tell from 2015 we still achieved some, but let's say the low-hanging fruit were largely picked back in 2012 through 2014, and we'll keep working on it. But I just wanted to highlight that for you.","Vivien Azer","Got it. That's perfect. Thank you. In terms of Miller Lite in the U.S. and the quarterly result there, can you quantify how much the launch of the steinie bottle, how much of an impact that had?","Dave Dunnewald","No, but I would say that it's yet another step in the process of really, how do you say, tapping into the authentic roots of that brand, so it's a very -- anyway, it's going great. And it is a limited time bottle, but it went well enough that you may see it again. The other thing Kevin mentioned is related to free cash flow. It also mentioned we do have some FX headwinds in 2016, which would be incremental to what we saw in 2015, based purely on the FX rates at the end of January.","Vivien Azer","Okay. Perfect. Got it. In terms of the FX impacts that you are experiencing in Europe, if I contrast the magnitude of the hit that you are getting on the top line versus the bottom line, obviously this moves around for everybody, but order of magnitude, there was a pretty big disconnect in the fourth quarter. Is there anything transactional that would have driven that?","Dave Dunnewald","Well, yes. What you're dealing with in Europe is a lot of currencies. In Canada, it's relatively simple math. You can go look at your Bloomberg terminal and get a sense of the translational impact, and then, okay, you know about the kinds of hedging activity that we do to mitigate that to some extent. But in Europe you have lots of currencies. You have inputs in not only USD-denominated currencies and some in Euros. It's a much more complex equation in Europe. If you're not seeing a one-on-one trade across, for example, how the Euro is performing versus the U.S. dollar, one reason is a big chunk of our business is in the UK, so actually the pound is very important there, as well as other currencies on lots of those Central European countries. I think that's why you're not seeing a one-for-one relationship, the way you might see it in Canada.","Vivien Azer","Okay. But this quarter, the impact to your pre-tax income was far less significant than it was to sales. Is that a relationship that can persist, or those two numbers should normalize, come in line together over time?","Dave Dunnewald","I'm not going to forecast it for you, but I would say that the performance of the UK pound was very critical in that. I would say we also had a lot of factors between net sales. I'm not sure whether you're looking at a constant currency, the constant currency pretax numbers versus the net sales constant currency numbers we gave you. But actually, let's see. In fact, why don't I just look at those? You've got pretax impact on the, call it for the full year, or were you just looking at the quarter? Okay. I think you were looking at the quarter.","Vivien Azer","I was.","Dave Dunnewald","On a constant currency basis, there was a bit of a disconnect. I can't really give you a forecast on that, but there are a lot of moving parts within the business units, and different things denominated in different currencies and that sort of thing.","Vivien Azer","Got it. And sticking with Europe, your guidance for single-digit inflation in terms of COGS per hectoliter, you're coming off a pretty deflationary 2015. So what's going to drive that inflection? Is it just the comp itself, or is there something else going on?","Dave Dunnewald","Let me take the headline on that and David can add some additional color if we need to. The Europe guidance being up low single digits versus, I think it was down low single digits last year, one of the big drivers of that was last year, we had two major contracts going away, both of which, how do you say, reduced the dollars on the COGS line. By the way, they also reduce the dollars on net sales revenue line, as well.","But without having any impact on the volume. So if you're looking at COGS per hectoliter, then the dollars last year went down, partially due to those contracts. David, is there anything else you would add in Europe, specifically related to last year versus this year on the COGS?","David Heede","Yes. So in terms of commodity pricing, commodity pricing has fallen, but we do have hedging programs in place, which has dampened that effect. Commodity pricing is a relatively small part of COGS in Europe, and Central Europe in particular. So those other costs are increasing.","What I would just draw your attention to, in addition to what Dave mentioned around the contract sales, we are trying to premiumize the portfolio, so an example of that would be quarterly going into the UK, and at the same time, we are trying to fund higher premiumization of our portfolio, along with innovation. So that's all within that low single-digit increase.","Vivien Azer","That's very helpful. Thanks a bunch.","Dave Dunnewald","Thanks, Vivien. One other thing I was going to add is when I look at the constant currency percent change on sales versus pretax, I really don't see much difference at all. So I think -- anyway, but there are a lot of moving parts, as I mentioned earlier, when you're working your way from net sales down to pretax in Europe.","Vivien Azer","Definitely. We'll do our best on the currencies. Cross our fingers","Dave Dunnewald","And we'll do our best to help. Thanks, Vivien.","Operator","Your next question is from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore. Your line is open.","Robert Ottenstein","Great. Thank you very much. I was just wondering if you could revisit with us your long-term plans, in terms of giving cash back to shareholders. Once this transaction is consummated, you're going to be generating enormous amounts of cash. Obviously, you're going to have some deleveraging. You ought to be able to delever pretty quickly.","Number one, roughly, how long do you think you'll keep the dividend flat? And going forward, do you -- would you go back to your old policy of growing the dividend with EBITDA, I believe? How should we think about long-term return of cash to shareholders between dividends and share buybacks?","Dave Dunnewald","Thanks, Robert. Let's see, so our approach to capital allocation has not changed. We still have the same three buckets we've been talking about for years. We have the first one being returning cash to shareholders. Second, balance sheet strength. Third, growth opportunities.","MillerCoors is clearly in the last bucket growth opportunity. Second bucket, balance sheet, with the financing associated with the MillerCoors transaction, assuming completion in the second half of this year. That's going to be a primary area of focus for us for a while. First bucket of returning cash to shareholders, as you know, we suspended our buyback program for now, and we also have said that we're going to hold our cash quarterly dividend at the rate that it currently is, for the time being. So to your specific question, we said until our debt repayment is well under way, and I guess, beyond that -- I'm sorry. You have mentioned what about the old target of annual trailing EBITDA payout ratio. We have had that in place for, what, a couple of years now, and we are suspending that for the time being, again, while we focus primarily on paying down debt. And we'll revisit both things like the dividend and the payout ratio and buybacks at the appropriate time. But right now, we need to focus primarily on paying down debt.","That is not to the exclusion of the other bucket obviously, because we're maintaining the dividend, and we have said that we will continue to look at bolt-on acquisitions, for example, in the last bucket as needed, as well, and we need to make sure that our pensions are properly funded, although you can tell by the numbers we mentioned earlier that they are at approximately 97% funded status at this point. Does that help?","Robert Ottenstein","Not really, but I guess that's probably all you can say at this point.","Dave Dunnewald","Yes, I think -- sorry, Robert. You're right. In other words, I can't tell you exactly when we'll get back.","Robert Ottenstein","I understand. I don't mean to give you a hard time. I appreciate where you're coming from.","Dave Dunnewald","Great.","David Heede","Robert, its David speaking. Our focus will be deleveraging, and the reason that is our focus is, it's very important to us that we retain that investment-grade status. So in the near term, that will be our priority.","Dave Dunnewald","And the other thing, Robert, I would add, while I can't tell you exactly what our timing will be in the future, I think you have a pretty good sense of what our priorities are, and a pretty good sense of our track record. For example, coming out of the StarBev transaction, the kinds of debt levels we have, the kinds of -- I think we've put some real energy around a disciplined, balanced approach to returning cash to shareholders, while still growing the business and ensuring that our balance sheet is strong. If you look at some of the steps in the last few years coming out of the StarBev transaction, I think you'll at least see how we think about these things.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.","Brett Cooper","A couple of quick ones. I think in the past you've given this to us. Can you give us the break-out generally of pension expansion, COGS, and MG&A?","Dave Dunnewald","Yes. It varies by the business unit because pension follows the people, and so we don't give specific numbers. But yes, if you think about where the labor sits, so for example, in the U.S. business, you're going to have greater exposure to -- sorry, a higher percent of the total pension expense flowing through COGS, and in some places in Europe, for example, you would have a higher percentage going through MG&A, because you have a bunch of entreed [ph] sales people that are in the legacy pension plan there, for example.","But we can't give you specific percentages. There have been some indications in the 10-K in previous years, when there were pension curtailments and so forth. You could look for those. It will vary quite a bit by segment.","Brett Cooper","Okay. One thing I just want to check on Canada, when you gave the STR numbers, that's on a comparable basis for selling days, right?","Dave Dunnewald","Right. We did not mention any selling day differences when we provided the Canada STR number. All we did was give you a view that excluded the Miller brands because obviously that's a change in business.","Brett Cooper","But in theory, there's one less day in January, right? I'm wondering, the U.S. number you always give is selling day adjustments. I just wanted to know what you did in Canada.","Dave Dunnewald","Well, we generally give selling day adjusted numbers in the US, and that's it. Generally speaking, we don't adjust the other businesses. But you're right. Sometimes there's -- there are some differences in when for example our customers can either -- well, when they could buy the beer, or depending on which province you're in, for example, whether it's Ontario or Quebec, or when we can ship the beer to retailers, if you're talking about -- that would be Quebec and then Ontario would actually be consumer impact.","So there can be some variations there. I guess what I would say is, whenever you're looking at a short time period, like January, only for a couple of the business units we tried to give you a little bit more, five weeks, that those short time periods can have a great deal of volatility, and not only because of things like how the days line up in the calendar, which they do matter, actually, to weather, for example. Or the timing of the Super Bowl. That was actually a large impact in the U.S. business, not in the numbers we gave you, because we gave you the numbers through the Super Bowl, both years. If we only look at January, that would have been a significant factor.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Vivien Azer of Cowen. Your line is open.","Vivien Azer","A little bit of a nitpickier question, but in Mark's prepared remarks in the press release, he said positive net pricing globally, as well as in most of our major markets. Is there a callout where you didn't get positive pricing?","Dave Dunnewald","Well, we did get positive net pricing, as you're aware, in MillerCoors. You also know that we got some positive pricing in Europe. We talked about that, and in Canada. Those would all be in local currency. But within some of those markets and within some of our other -- like the MCI business, there are some markets where we've got some mix impacts, and so forth. So there are some countries within those units that, well, specifically in places like Europe and MCI, where we did not have positive pricing.","Vivien Azer","Okay. That's fair.","Dave Dunnewald","We don't identify specific countries by price, for example.","Vivien Azer","But wherever you didn't get the positive price, you feel like that's transitory in nature? Or is there one market that's structurally challenged from either a pricing or a mix perspective?","Dave Dunnewald","I would say that we're not concerned with the pricing in those markets that were negative. As you know, we've had a lot of challenges in Serbia, for example, related to things like floods and the economy and a few competitive brands sorts of challenges and so forth. That's a market where I think we're in a much better place than we were a couple of years ago, and we're working, we feel good about where we are in all the countries, even the ones where we've got some pricing challenges. That's just life in the global beer business.","Vivien Azer","Sure, sure. And then just last one, on MCI, how do we think about the cadence on the, not necessarily startup costs, but you called out higher investments in newer markets. I assume that's in part Colombia. How do we think about the phasing that over the course of 2016?","Dave Dunnewald","In Colombia, we're not going to be able to give you specifics on how we phase intros into markets, but Colombia is an important South American beer market. The weather there has less seasonality to it than places like Canada, so that's a good thing. But we'll manage the investment in, for example, Colombia, within the context of the overall MCI plan, which includes getting to profitability, less FX since 2013, but getting the profitability in 2016.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have no further audio questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Dunnewald.","Dave Dunnewald","Great. Thanks, Lori. In closing, I would like to thank all of you for your interest in Molson Coors, and for joining us today.

Our speakers today are Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer.","With that I will hand it over to Mark Swartzberg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Mark Swartzberg","Thank you, Steven. Hello, everyone. Following prepared remarks from Gavin and Tracey, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one question, please ask your most pressing question first, and then reenter the queue to follow-up. We expect you will have various questions on the revitalization plan we announced this morning to the extent that you have technical questions on the quarter, we ask that you pick them up with me in the days and weeks that follow.","Today's discussion includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

I\u2019d like to first frame the revitalization plan we included in the slides we filed with the SEC and announced to our employees earlier this morning, and which I will review in more depth after Tracey\u2019s remarks. We are one of the world\u2019s leading brewers and own a tremendous portfolio of brands, but we\u2019re over-indexed in declining segments. Our core brands have seen years of volume losses and our marketing spend and innovation capabilities haven\u2019t kept up with the competition.","Our business is at an inflection point. We can continue down the path we\u2019ve been on for several years, or we can make the significant and difficult changes necessary to get back on track. Our revitalization plan is designed to streamline the company, to move faster, and to free up resources to invest in our brands and our capabilities. And through it, we will create a brighter future for Molson Coors. The plan aims to revitalize Molson Coors, achieving consistent topline growth by enabling us to invest in iconic brands as well as opportunities to grow in the above premium space, expand beyond beer without having to sacrifice support for larger brands in the company\u2019s portfolio, and to create new digital competencies for commercial functions, system capabilities for supply chain and new capabilities for employees.","To make this possible, we plan to unlock resources by eliminating duplication, shedding what\u2019s not working and restructuring the organization to better succeed in today\u2019s competitive, fast-paced environment. And I will review this plan with you shortly. But first, over to you Tracey for Q3 results.","Tracey Joubert","Thank you, Gavin, and hello everyone. I will speak first to the quarter on a consolidated and regional basis then to our 2019 outlook. So, to recap the quarter, our net sales revenue decreased 2% in constant currency. We delivered strong pricing in each business unit and positive global mix, but this was more than offset by volume declines. Net sales per hectoliter, on a brand-volume basis, increased 3% in constant currency and worldwide brand volume decreased 2.4% and financial volume decreased 5.5%. Global priority brand volume decreased 2.2%.","Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 5.9% on a constant currency basis driven by inflation and volume de-leverage, partially offset by cost savings. Underlying MG&A decreased 2.2% on a constant currency basis, driven by slightly lower marketing spend and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by cycling a net benefit from the amicable resolution of a vendor dispute. However, marketing spend per hectoliter was up in the quarter and year-to-date. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 5.6% on a constant currency basis. Our year-to-date underlying free cash flow was $884.8 million, 13.7% below the prior year, driven by lower underlying EBITDA and higher cash tax payments, partially offset by lower capital expenditures and lower cash interest payments.","Moving to our business units. In the U.S., net sales revenue decreased 2.3%, driven by a 6.2% decline in shipments to wholesalers, excluding contract brewing, this was partially offset by positive net pricing and mix. The shipment decrease was driven by two factors. First, we cycled last year\u2019s network-wide inventory builds to support our Trenton and Fort Worth brewery go-lives, which resulted in very strong STWs in the third quarter of prior year. Second, brand volumes declined 3.9% on a trading-day adjusted basis in the quarter. COGS per hectoliter increased 6.6%, driven by inflation, volume deleverage, and other factors, including a substantial unanticipated increase in property tax at our Golden brewery, partially offset by cost savings.","MG&A increased 3.3%, driven by cycling a net benefit from the amicable resolution of a vendor dispute in the prior year, partially offset by the incremental cost reductions related to the restructuring program initiated in the third quarter of 2018. Marketing investment per hectoliter remains higher year-to-date compared to prior year. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 8.6%. In Europe, net sales revenue increased 1.7% on a constant currency basis, driven by positive pricing and mix offsetting a slight decline in brand volumes. COGS per hectoliter increased 3.5% in constant currency, due to inflation. MG&A decreased 1.7% in constant currency, driven by lower incentive compensation expense, offsetting higher marketing investment focused on our national champion brands and premiumization initiatives. Marketing spend per hectoliter was up in the quarter and year-to-date. As a result, underlying EBITDA increased 0.6% in constant currency.","In Canada, net sales revenue decreased 4.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by a 5.1% decline in brand volume partly due to industry softness, partially offset by positive pricing. COGS per hectoliter increased 9.7% in constant currency, primarily driven by volume deleverage, cycling prior year distribution gains, brewery start-up costs and inflation, with a partial offset from cost savings. MG&A decreased 7.7% in constant currency, driven by timing shifts of higher marketing investment in Q2 as well as lower incentive compensation, partially offset by Truss joint venture start-up costs. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 12.3% in constant currency.","In addition, during the quarter, we identified a goodwill impairment triggering event due to prolonged weakness in industry performance impacting our long-range expected cash flows. Consequently, a charge of $668.3 million was recorded to specials in the Canada U.S. GAAP results. Also note we estimate Truss related startup costs of 10 to 15 million Canadian dollars in 2019. In our International business, net sales revenue decreased 15.5% on a constant currency basis driven by an 8.6% decline in brand volume and negative geographic mix, partially offset by price increases. COGS per hectoliter increased 6.1% in constant currency, driven by geographic mix and inflation. MG&A decreased 29% in constant currency, driven by lower marketing spend and incentive compensation expense. As a result, we delivered $7.7 million of underlying EBITDA, resulting in a 190% increase on a constant currency basis.","Moving to our 2019 outlook, our earnings release details our guidance. In terms of cost savings, we continue to expect a total of $700 million of savings for the three years ending 2019, and Gavin will speak to upsizing of our previously communicated $450 million to $600 million for the period 2020 through 2022, to be spread evenly over that period. The additional $150 million of savings is before one-time costs to achieve and will help fund additional investment. We continue to expect 2019 consolidated underlying COGS per hectoliter to increase at a mid-single digit rate on a constant currency basis.","We now expect 2019 consolidated interest expense of $275 million plus or minus 5%. We expect 2019 capital spending of $700 million plus or minus 10%. We expect 2019 underlying D&A of approximately $850 million. We continue to estimate underlying free cash flow of $1.4 billion plus or minus 10% this year. And finally, before I hand the call back to Gavin, a comment regarding the remainder of the year. We continue to expect to ship to consumption in the U.S. on a full-year basis and therefore expect fourth quarter year-on-year change in shipments to exceed fourth quarter year-on-year change in brand volume.","With that, back to you, Gavin.","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks, Tracey. I look forward to speaking with you quarterly to discuss our financial results, but today I want to focus on our revitalization plan to deliver better results than we have in recent years. Our company makes some of the world\u2019s greatest beers and our iconic brands have withstood the test of time. But as the world around us rapidly changes and the nature of competition intensifies, our business performance is lagging. I\u2019m sure all of you are well aware of that. And that is why we are implementing a revitalization plan that includes meaningful change for Molson Coors to unlock significant resources that we can invest back into the company, putting more resources behind our brands, premiumizing and modernizing our portfolio and building new capabilities.","The good news is that as a major brewer with a rich portfolio of iconic brands across key categories, we have the scale and cash flow to improve topline growth. We have the capabilities to succeed. And while the market joins us in our attention to the topline, our financial performance demonstrates our commitment to strong financial discipline through robust cash flow, balance sheet strength and returning cash to shareholders.","So why do we need a revitalization plan? All of you know the dynamics we face, and we recognize where we have the opportunity to improve, increase our exposure to growth segments, bigger and faster innovations, and a more simplified and streamlined organization. And what\u2019s more, in the past few years our competitors have significantly stepped up their marketing spend and innovation capabilities relative to ours, to keep pace with the changing marketplace, and as such, we must invest more if we expect to drive long-term sustainable success.","There are five components in our plan to revitalize Molson Coors. We are going to invest in our iconic brands. We are going to aggressively grow our above premium business. We are going to expand in adjacencies and beyond beer. We will increase our investment in marketing and commercial capabilities. And all of that will be enabled by streamlining our company, resulting in a more effective organization, with additional fuel to fund our investments. As I walk through the plan, I will also highlight how things will be different than before.","We have shown we can improve the performance of our iconic brands and can stabilize brand performance and position for sustainable growth by accelerating investment behind our largest brands, by focusing on recruitment especially of new legal age drinking consumers, by driving relevance with breakthrough marketing, and by innovating on core brands to attract new legal age drinkers. We\u2019re seeing what\u2019s possible right now with Coors Light in the United States. Now, I understand it\u2019s still very early, but the highly acclaimed Coors Light \u201cMade to Chill\u201d campaign that launched in the U.S. is already showing positive results.","The brand is suddenly part of pop culture again with new partnerships, as a topic on late night TV shows and even as a favorite of the Jonas brothers. So much so that in the past few months the brand has generated more than 2 billion PR impressions. Today, after struggling for years in the U.S., Coors Light is finally gaining segment share and seeing volume improvement under the new campaign. Our plan is to put more resources behind breakthrough marketing like this. It\u2019s a model for breaking through the noise of your usual big beer ads that we hope to replicate with the new Miller Lite campaign in the U.S. that just launched during the World Series last week. The brand is redefining the iconic Miller Time slogan for a new generation of legal age drinkers, connecting them to Miller Lite in a fresh way that we haven\u2019t done before.","These are very different new campaigns for two of our biggest brands. And under our revitalization plan, we can execute big campaigns for our iconic brands without having to sacrifice our efforts to premiumize and modernize our portfolio. Now you know we are not happy with our above premium performance, but we are not without our successes. In Europe, we have successfully transformed our portfolio over the last few years and are now sourcing more than 30% of our volume from above premium brands, including increasing strength for Staropramen. In the U.S., this quarter represented Blue Moon\u2019s best quarter since 2017, and Peroni is growing strongly on the strength of the brand and its first national media campaign of the year. And in Canada Belgian Moon is continuing its great run, up forty percent year to date.","Our revitalization plan is intended to give us the resources we need to aggressively build on those above premium success stories with our existing brands, with new innovations and potentially through new bolt-on acquisitions and investments for our portfolio. This means more money to market big ideas like Saint Archer Gold, Blue Moon Light Sky and Coors Peak in the U.S. and Coors Slice and Molson Ultra in Canada. It also means enhancing our ability to bring new beverages to the market more quickly and with more precision. We will expand the model that has reduced the time it takes to bring our innovations to market to as little as four months in the U.S. We will also expand a test and learn approach that lets us determine market potential for products and then quickly scale up like we are with Movo and Saint Archer Gold in the United States. Going forward, we plan to innovate, test, and scale products faster than we ever have before.","We also expect to be able to invest more in whitespace and beyond beer opportunities. This will give us the ability to invest in the continued growth of recent successes like Carling Black Fruits draught in Europe or taking Movo wine spritzers, our first ever canned wine national in the U.S. We also expect it will allow us to fuel an even stronger second year of Cape Line and a stronger third year of Arnold Palmer Spiked in the U.S., which we plan to rapidly scale.","And we need to do more. Our pipeline includes the recent introductions of La Colombe hard coffee in the U.S., Pip & Wild premium ciders in the U.K., Vizzy hard seltzer in the U.S. which we plan to launch early next year, and Truss\u2019s new line of Cannabis-infused non-alcoholic beverages in Canada, including the recently announced Flow Glow CBD-infused spring water. You will see us push into these whitespaces faster than we ever have in the past.","Our revitalization plan depends upon our competing and winning on the foundation of our great beers. It also means we must extend beyond the beer aisle, and so beginning January 1, 2020 our corporate name will be Molson Coors Beverage Company. While this is a simple change, the name speaks volumes about who we are and what is possible for our business.","We will also invest in expanding in key capabilities. That will mean improving our digital competencies, expanding our data resources and building out our innovation systems. It will also mean investing in tangible plans to build a more diverse and inclusive organization and to support growth opportunities for our people. We also plan to invest several hundred million dollars to modernize our brewery in Golden, Colorado. This previously planned investment will modernize the brewery to allow for more flexibility, enable us to move with pace and deliver new products to meet changing consumer preferences. The company is not using the cost savings generated from this revitalization plan to make this brewery investment possible.","Those of you keeping models will see we are upping our three-year cost savings plan to $600 million from $450 million. But the reorganization driving that is much more than a new cost-savings program: It comes with the difficult decision to consolidate and reorganize office locations and eliminate a number of positions. It means a streamlined organization, as we are moving from a corporate center and four business units to two business units: North America and Europe. Our North America business unit will combine the United States, Canada and our corporate center, giving us consolidated leadership teams and enabling us to move much more quickly with an integrated portfolio strategy. The Europe business unit will be structured to allow for standalone operations, developed and supported by a European-based team, including a regional leadership team and commercial and support functions.","Our International business provides important growth opportunities, but the existing Molson Coors International team will be reconstituted to more effectively grow our global brands. The international business in the Americas will become part of the North America business unit, while the international business in Africa and Asia will become part of the Europe business unit. It also means a revised leadership team, including Tracey as CFO; Simon Cox as President and CEO of Molson Coors Europe; and Michelle St Jacques as Chief Marketing Officer. We won\u2019t have a President of the U.S. business; rather a significant portion of my job will be dedicated to ensuring our success in our North America business unit. We currently estimate the costs of all these changes will result in total one-time costs in the range of approximately $120 million to $180 million over the balance of this year 2020 and 2021. Once the transition is complete our organization will look and act dramatically different than it has in the past and we fully expect to be better positioned to compete in today\u2019s fast-paced, competitive market.","Which takes me to our financial outlook. We expect 2020 to be a transition year and anticipate net sales revenue to be flat-to-down low single-digits on a constant currency basis. We expect EBITDA to be down mid-single digits off the base of the last 12 months trailing underlying EBITDA of $2.289 billion on a constant currency basis. We estimate underlying free cash flow of $1.1 billion plus or minus 10%, including higher cash taxes than in 2019 and additional capital spending to support growth. And we are upsizing our expected cost savings from $450 million to $600 million for the period 2020 through 2022, to be spread more or less evenly over that period.","We expect 2021 and thereafter to deliver net sales revenue and EBITDA growth versus 2020, while delivering the remainder of the $150 million in added cost savings. We intend to maintain our investment grade credit rating, and there is no change to our dividend payout objective. The change in structure to two business units will not be effective until January 2020, and therefore the resulting financial reporting changes will not be reflected until our first quarter 2020 results.","This is a lot of change, but we will execute it efficiently because we cannot wait and risk allowing the competition to continue passing us by, to outspend us, to out innovate us, and to outmaneuver us. We will move faster and free up resources. We will invest in our brands and in our capabilities. We will regain the success of our past, and we will create a brighter future for the Molson Coors Beverage Company.","Thank you for your time and attention, and with that, I'll turn it back to Steven for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Drew Levine","Hi, good morning. This is Drew Levine on for Amit. Thanks for taking the question. Just to start on the revitalization plan, I'm calling for a mid-single-digit decrease in EBITDA next year in addition to cost savings. So can you just maybe walk us through what, gives you confidence that the level of investment that you're planning for next year is the right amount and sort of what work was done to arrive at that number? Thank you.","Gavin Hattersley","Well, thanks and good morning, Drew. Look, I mean we've made a lot of progress in the last several years deleveraging and generating cash and delivering on our financial commitments. But I think it\u2019s safe to start investments in innovation capabilities haven't kept pace with our competitors, as I said, what is required in this rapidly changing industry. So under the plan that I've outlined: we're going take more calculated risks, we're going to move faster, we're going to diversify our portfolio. And the revitalization plan that I've laid out just now generates $150 million in cost savings.","But obviously we're not going to get that whole $150 million on day one and we want to start investing behind the ideas that we've got behind the innovations and behind some of the very successful breakthrough marketing that we've generated as well. And so taking the EBITDA guidance down for next year will allow us to invest behind our core brands, behind our new innovations in our above premium portfolio earlier than we would otherwise if we had to wait for the $450 million.","Next question, Steven.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning everybody. And first I just wanted to thank you for giving some EBITDA guidance. I think it just makes it a lot easier for us to have a little bit of clarity on that as we're trying to evaluate the plan. So thanks for making that change. I guess my question, Gavin, is if we look at the current incentive comp I think on an annual basis, 25% is volume, 25% is revenue per hectoliter, and if I remember correctly that was sort of designed to make sure that the industry \u2013 the company was focused on both growing volume and doing it without \u2013 doing it irresponsibly. So I guess as you're looking forward now, and especially with a bigger focused on above premium, which implies maybe some brands that are higher value, less volume. Is volume less of a sort of important driver going forward versus just growing revenue? And will that be reflected maybe in the way you change contemplate changing incentive comp?","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks, Bryan for that question and good morning to you. Look, I mean from an incentive comp point of view, we actually going into those conversations now with our compensation committee. This is the cycle of time period when we said that, and I can assure you that the comp committee will want to make sure that our incentive plan is aligned absolutely with what we're trying to do. So next year will be a transition year as I said, as we reshape our portfolio and put the emphasis and focus on where we believe it needs to be and where we have a right to win. And then beyond that as I said, we would expect a growth in both the top-line and the bottom-line. So more to come on that front as we \u2013 as we design the incentive with our comp committee, but I can assure you it will be aligned.","Bryan Spillane","But would it be fair to say that volume maybe less important going forward given the focus on some of the smaller, maybe just revenue per unit brands?","Gavin Hattersley","But as we make decisions on our portfolio and make decisions around what we are going to focus on and what we're not going to focus on, obviously that will be reflected in our volume plan for the year ahead. So if there are skews that we believe are unproductive for us to be focusing on and we eliminated them and that would be reflected in the goals for volume. Obviously the emphasis for us is on our core brands and our innovation and our above premium portfolio. And Bryan, we really excited about the innovation portfolio, which we've got coming. The feedback we've got from our distributor network and from our retail partners around brands like Blue Moon Light Sky and Saint Archer Gold and Arnold Palmer Spiked, Cape Line and Peroni I can go on and on and on and is palpable. So obviously the focus will be there for us.","Bryan Spillane","All right. Thanks, Gavin. I'll leave it there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Steve Powers","Hey, thanks. So Gavin, that the plans you laid it out calls for you to invest in brands and invest in above premium, invest more in beyond beer, do it all with increased marketing and funded with accelerated productivity, which I think makes sense. But to what extent is that really a change or just an acceleration of what I think you were really already doing?","And to the earlier question between the incremental savings benefits and the lowered EBITDA outlook, it looks like we're talking about is maybe a couple of hundred million dollars maybe a couple hundred basis points of incremental investment in revitalize marketing and innovation over the life of the plan. Is that right? And if so, why are we sure that that's, that's enough to overcome the headwinds your portfolio has been facing, and as you say, it continues to face? Thanks.","Gavin Hattersley","Yes, we look under the plan that I've outlined, Steve, thanks. What's going to be different? Well, I think you're going to see us take more calculated risks. Hopefully you've already started to see that with some of the breakthrough marketing campaigns that we've gotten. And you'll see that in some of the innovation which we're going to come forward with. I would like to hope that you've already seen a change in how quickly we are coming to market. We've been too slow in the past and we're going to move even quicker than we have in the last sort of six months or so.","And we are going to diversify our portfolio. Changing the name of the company to Molson Coors Brewing Company, it might seem like a small change but it's a very deliberate reflection of where we see potential future growth for us, which is in beyond beer. So we're going to be able to fund the good ideas without making the tradeoffs that we've had to make potentially in the past behind our bigger brands.","So if you're looking for what's different, moderate more calculated risks, moving much quicker and being able to invest behind our core brands, behind breakthrough marketing, behind those core brands, but more particularly behind our both premium and in innovations and beyond beer that's coming. I think that's quite a meaningful difference to what's happened in the past.","Steve Powers","Okay. So just to clarify, so let's say, the changes you can do, it's an endgame, as opposed to having to make a choice between iconic core brands and new and improved initiatives. And then I think you can do \u2013 we can do both with the increased level of investment?","Gavin Hattersley","Yes. That's part of it, Steve. That's correct.","Steve Powers","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Robert Ottenstein","Great. Thank you very much. So Gavin, as you look forward, could you kind of give us a sense of, to what extent if any \u2013 the firm's capital allocation priorities may change? Where do you see leverage going and it's specifically where I'm coming from is as you talk about going beyond beer so to speak. Does this mean that M&A is going to be a larger focus going forward? And can you give us a sense of order of magnitude and how big and what kind of targets you're giving to the firm for non-beer to be longer term, three, four, five years out? Thank you.","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks, Robert. So a lot of questions there let me try and capture all of them.","So first and foremost, let me reiterate that our investment grade ratings important to us and anything we do in the world of M&A is going to take that into account. I see this as more of a bolt-on strategy, much like we've done in the UK with brands like Sharp\u2019s and breweries like Franciscan Wells and in the United States with the cross companies like Hop Valley and Terrapin. And we're going to build when we can, we'll borrow when we don't have the capabilities like Arnold Palmer Spiked as an example. All the credentials and we'll buy when it's necessary are compelling, but it remains very much a bolt-on strategy.","As far as beyond beer is concerned I'm obviously not going to tip my hand to our competitors just yet, but we've already started moving in that direction and we plan to accelerate that movement. You know, just a few examples of that would be movo wine spritzers, La Colombe hard coffees, Cannabis joint venture in Canada. As I said to Steve on the previous question, changing our name to Molson Coors Beverages actually recognizes what's possible for our business, not only in beer but in beverage, it points to the way forward. And our M&A strategy in this regard would be the same as what I've just said from a bolt-on strategy point of view.","Robert Ottenstein","And the beyond beer would report into Marino?","Gavin Hattersley","It would report into our present and emerging brands that Pete Marino, yes.","Robert Ottenstein","All right. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks, good morning everyone. A brief sort of maintenance one on the prior question. Can you touch on buyback? You did not \u2013 stocks obviously underperformed. I am sure you're just pleased about that. Where does share buyback fit in, if at all with respect to capital allocation?","The other question though, the more strategic question, not a big hit on this call so far, but certainly has been in others and that would be Spike Seltzers which obviously continued to do really, really well, didn't really see anything in the release with respect to that. Your key competitors are leaning in here pretty hard both with existing and new brands. ABI obviously coming in with Bud Light, Constellation with Corona, but haven't really heard anything on that front. Update on the Spike Seltzer category whether this is just more investment behind Henry\u2019s which has a couple of points of share, but it's been bleeding a bit as of late. Any plans to extend the Coors Light brand? Any update there would be helpful? Thank you very much.","Gavin Hattersley","Cool, okay. I\u2019ll take your second question and then Tracey, if you wouldn't mind taking the capital allocation share buyback question. So Kevin, yes, for sure we believe the seltzer category is here to stay. We don't believe it's going to continue to grow at the meteoric rate, which has done forever, but it's a category that we need to do a much better job competing in and we need to do that in a meaningful way and we plan to do that.","Although it's off a small base at the moment, we're excited to see Henry's Spark is growing triple digits and we've got plans to revamp that brand in 2020. In the early next year we're coming out with Vizzy, which is a hard seltzer that we think can effectively compete in the segment in the long-term? It's a brand that's got 5% ABV, 100 calories, but it's got distinguishing characteristics to make it standout from the competition in which we believe can leapfrog them. So stay tuned on that because we'll announce more about Vizzy along with a few other interesting ideas that we've got soon. Tracey?","Tracey Joubert","Okay. So let me pick-up the buyback, Kevin. So we look at our capital allocation model in three buckets. We look at returning cash to shareholders. We just have increased our dividend this last quarter. We announced that earlier this year, so increased it to the 20% to 25% trailing EBITDA. And we look at back \u2013 of strengthening our balance sheet, and as Gavin said, maintaining our investment grade rating is really important, but continuing to pay down our debt. And then the third bucket is investing behind growth and the revitalization plan that Gavin has laid-off has got the incremental investment behind our brands and our business. When we look at our capital allocation, we obviously run all of the investments through our PET model. We have discussions with our finance committee around capital allocation and but at this point in time we are focusing on those three buckets as I've mentioned.","Gavin Hattersley","I hope that helps, Kevin. Next question, Steven.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean King with UBS. Please go ahead.","Sean King","Hi. Thank you. Can you talk about how inputs play into your initial 2020 EBITDA outlook? Are you modeling any benefit from using aluminum or logistics headwinds?","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks, Sean. Look I think the commodity environment is pretty well understood from a public point of view we're expecting freight to come down and then that's demonstrated in the fact that we've reduced our freight surcharge to our distributors over the prior year. ","Tracey, do you want to give any additional comments on that?","Tracey Joubert","Yes certainly and soon we will give more guidance in Q4 around our COGS for next year. But certainly we've had a look at number of inputs commodities. We've continued to see inflation this year. So we'll build that into our plans for next year and we have full setting to our plans for next year, but \u2013 and if I can ask if you can wait until our Q4 call, we'll give you more details on our COGS guidance for next year.","Sean King","Okay, thank you\u2026","Gavin Hattersley","That'd be on edge that Sean, is obviously that which we know about and we do hedge and we do have freight programs that which we know about is built into our EBITDA guidance that which we don't control like tariffs and it\u2019s not built into guidance.","Sean King","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi, good morning. I was just trying to understand what kind of category of growth you\u2019re implying in this guide for 2020, and also your commentary about coming back to growth in 2021 for both top-line and EBITDA? So basically, I mean, number one is that a soft guidance or aspiration?","And number two, if you can give us again the category performance that is embedded in your algorithm. Is that the premium lights in economy, can get to flat and that the growth will be driven by above premium or you're still embedding some decline into premium lights and economy and then getting all the growth with innovation? Thank you.","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks, Andrea and good morning. So let me go maybe category-by-category. From an economy portfolio segment point of view, we're not expecting the economy segment to grow. We're expecting it to decline. As we expect the Premium Light category to decline as well. Our goal within Premium Light with our iconic Miller Lite and Coors Light brands through the breakthrough marketing, which we've developed and we continue to build on along with the additional firepower that we've got, is that we believe we can continue to grow a meaningful share in what is a declining segment. But let's not forget that it's around 100 million hectoliters of volume declining at a sort of 1% to 2% rate. So lot of volume out of there and there's a lot of shade that we can go after. Certainly our forecast saw that the above premium segment will continue to grow, it will grow strongly and we intend to accelerate our share there as we go forward.","Andrea Teixeira","Gavin, I think you \u2013 I think another, I think Steve have had asked the question, how much you are aspiring within this and still have your volumes in the U.S. \u2013 think your volumes in the U.S. and the above premium is only about 10%, do you think you can \u2013 you can get that 10% of how much in the next two years?","Gavin Hattersley","Andrea, so I'm not going to put a specific number to that but I would say to you that we expect to have a meaningfully greater percentage in our both premium portfolio in the years ahead, that's where our investment is going to be, that's where our focus is going to be. Our innovation pipeline is focused there. So just to cover them again, brands like Blue Moon Light Sky and our investment behind Peroni has proven that when we've got marketing that works and we've got the marketing spend to put behind it that we can drive significant growth in our above premium brands. Peroni is up strong-double digits in the first three quarters of 2019 and is more than tripled its growth rate for the first nine months. That's what's different in this plan. When we've got the money and we've got the ideas we can make the brands work.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you, Gavin.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Everybody, good afternoon. When we think about the \u2013 hey Gavin, when I think about the revitalization plan, it sounds, it sounds familiar. You've got a good history of cost savings, achieving the savings, reinvesting it in the business. I think you had outlook some years ago of getting to flat by 2018. It sounds like more money is just \u2013 more cost saving is more money getting invested; again I\u2019m expecting a bit of a different outcome. So can you maybe discuss a bit in a bit more detail, what's different this time or how you're approaching it differently and how do you know that the issue is not, it's not just money and investment, but maybe something more broader?","Gavin Hattersley","Yes, that's a great question, Kaumil. So let me try and take that. We've got fine examples of when we have great ideas and we spend more money that we can drive a better performance and we've got green shoots popping up all over the place. From a \u2013 what's different point of view, I'll go back to the comments I made earlier on. We are going to take more risks than we have in the past. We're going to move much more quickly and we're not going to have to make the trade-off decisions that we may have had to make in the past between where we would put our investment dollars because we were being choiceful and that doesn't mean that we're \u2013 that we're going to become irresponsible or reckless and how we spend our money. But we're going to be, we're going to be careful but not as to make the tradeoffs we've had to make up in the past.","What's going to be different is we extend much more beyond beer without having to sacrifice for the larger brands, which I just talked about. We're going to invest a meaningfully bigger amount behind new capabilities, particularly in the world of digital and data management and systems capabilities for our supply chain and resources behind capabilities for our employees. We're going to invest in above premium. Again, we just gave the Peroni example; Blue Moon Belgian White also had its best trends since Q4 2017. Cape Line is a Top 10 growth brand, but allowed 20 consecutive quarters of segment share growth and Coors Light had segment share acceleration of volume improvement following the new creative. So we've got the green shoots, we've got the proof that when we have the firepower we put it behind our brands that we can make a difference.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Okay. If I could just ask you about beyond beer or a little bit more on beyond beer as part of the portfolio, the bulk of the business is still Miller Lite or Coors Light that there is still the two most important by far as you mentioned they're showing some improving trends and you're in at the beginning of a new revitalization plan. How do you prevent beyond beer from being a distraction because if you can get those other two working, the overall business will look much better and you'll be able to invest more in beyond beer at a faster pace. But ideally you'd need to get the core in better condition first. So how do you \u2013 changing the company name, all of this happening at the same time, how do you prevent it from being a distraction?","Gavin Hattersley","It\u2019s a great question, Kaumil. So, I mean, that is one of the reasons why we've setup a new role in my organization, which is the president of the emerging brands and Pete Marino is going to hit that up and that's going to be focusing on beyond beer. It's going to be focusing on our craft businesses, on our cannabis area, on wine and spirits. It will also look after our license in export brands. So that will be very specifically focused in Pete's area. Michelle is Head of Marketing for North America, but actually for our global brands as well globally. We'll be primarily focused on our core heritage iconic brand.","So we will have two big leaders focusing on these two areas. The part of the plan is ensuring that that we built and funded to do both, Kaumil. I mean that's what's the different about this plan. And the other thing is different is over the last few years, we've made a lot of progress in deleveraging, generating cash and delivering on our financial commitments. But in some respects we've done that and with this plan we're now able to do both.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Vivien Azer","Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the underlying algorithm for the U.S. from a segment perspective. So I understand what you guys are saying about, you know, really needing to stabilize the core and then over indexing in growth in above and then extending to beyond beer. But it's \u2013 you guys aren't the only ones that are doing that. And so, what I'm struggling with a little bit is understanding how the beer category broadly in your portfolio specifically improves because I would think that beer is going to be giving up shelf space from a category perspective to accommodate all this innovation in the hard seltzer. So how are you guys thinking about managing your own shelf space to ensure that this innovation is incremental? And how do you defend against what seemingly should be a shrinking shelf space environment for beer? Thank you.","Gavin Hattersley","Vivien, great points, right. But I think that ideas and breakthrough marketing and breakthrough innovation will lead the charge and we intend to be at the forefront of that. We've seen what can happen when you bring breakthrough innovation. The seltzer category is a fine example of that. And under our revitalization plan, it's our intent that we are the leader in many of these new capabilities and new brands. We've got a great distribution network and we've got a tremendous chain team, which does \u2013 that does a very good job of making sure that we get our fair share of space on the shelf. And I think in combination, we will have the result that we're looking for, which has substantially improved above premium percentage of our portfolio.","Part of what I also said was we\u2019ll be making choices and choices sometimes means that we will \u2013 we won't focus on brands, which are in meaningful decline or SKUs that are in meaningful decline. And we'll put our resources and focus on the growth areas of our business, which is above premium. We think that algorithm works for us. We think 2020 will be a transition year as we move towards that with growth coming in 2021.","Vivien Azer","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from a Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Lauren Lieberman","Great, thanks. Good morning. One question that I keep getting is whether or not there's actually enough flexibility like in the plan. So coupled with the fact that you've mentioned a couple times remaining investment grade is important and have highlighted the better financial position that you're in. The question is just if EBITDA's forecast to be down mid singles next year in this transition year, if revenues are down, let's say take the low end of your range and say low single digits, it doesn't feel like there is a lot of flexibility to keep the level \u2013 number one to hit 3.5, but number two for it not to kind of creep back up a little bit if revenue doesn't come through as hoped because there's greater volume de-leveraging and the category continues to be under so much pressure. So can you just talk a little bit about that element of all of us? How it fits together in terms of financial flexibility and making sure you really do have the room to do everything that you want to do and to feed those areas where you see these green shoots? Thanks.","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks Lauren. Look we've made a lot of progress, as I said, in the last few years, deleveraging and generating cash and delivering on the financial commitments that we made at the time of the acquisition of the 58% of MillerCoors that we didn't own. 2020 is a transition year for us. And we've \u2013 there's a lot of hard work to do to implement this revitalization plan. And you said that not all of our spend is going to come in on day one and not all of the cost savings are going to come in on day one. But yes, I do believe that given the work that we've done over the last few years and given the work that we've put into this plan and executing against this plan that we will have the money to put behind the breakthrough ideas and the beyond beer expansion that we want to do. You're seeing the results of that in 2021. Obviously, we'll have green shoots and we'll show them to you as we progressed over the next 12 to 15 months.","Lauren Lieberman","And I guess, Tracey, from your standpoint and the view on unlevered and the importance of the investment grade rating that feels comfortable under the confines of this plan.","Tracey Joubert","Yes. So as Gavin said and we've reiterated a number of times, investment grade rating is very important to us. And so the plan that we've laid out does take that into account.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, thanks for taking the follow-up. So just a couple of other cleanups just as we've got some questions in. First, Tracey, the $1.1 billion plus or minus free cash flow guidance for next year. I think your underlying free cash flow typically excludes like the cash costs for restructuring. So I just want to verify that that's the case. It's going to exclude the cash costs related to the restructuring program.","Tracey Joubert","Yes, Bryan, that\u2019s correct. That does exclude that.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then I think \u2013 in the prepared remarks, I think, there's some discussion about additional CapEx to support growth. So I just wanted to flesh out does that imply that that CapEx rate, which I think that kind of the normalized rate we were thinking over time was about $650 million. Does it imply that it might be a little bit elevated over the course of this three year plan?","Tracey Joubert","Yes. So, again, we\u2019re going to give more detailed CapEx guidance in Q4, when we give our guidance for the 2020 year. So if you don't mind waiting until then, Bryan, we can get into a bit more detail.","Bryan Spillane","Sure.","Gavin Hattersley","And it will be included in the $1.1 billion guidance that we've given, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","Within the confines of that guidance, okay. That's helpful. And then just the last one, Gavin, the investments in the Golden brewery, is that in part to make the company like more productive or more efficient at producing a wide range of maybe smaller batch production run. So if the ambition is to sort of expand into all these different adjacencies, this sort of retooling at Golden allows you to do that in a more efficient fashion?","Gavin Hattersley","If you go back to \u2013 I mean it's part of our overall plan, Bryan, to modernize our brewery network and make us more flexible and more efficient and more able to be nimble in dealing with the changing consumer tastes and profiles that we've got. So, we just commissioned the Chilliwack brewery up in the Vancouver area where we've broken ground on the Montreal brewery and the Golden brewery \u2013 and some parts of the Golden brewery are pretty old. And so, this plan will modernize that and make it much more efficient. And again, that's also built into the guidance and its part of our capital plan that we've had for quite some time now, so nothing unusual yet.","Bryan Spillane","All right. Thanks Gavin. Thanks Tracey.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Robert Ottenstein","Great, thank you also for the follow up and I want to just dig a little bit deeper into the last question. So, on the free cash flow, that's substantially a lower amount or a bigger hit than what's going on the EBITDA line. Obviously, you've got increased CapEx in there. You mentioned during the call that your cash tax rate was going up. Can you give us a sense of kind of the order of magnitude on the cash tax rate? And is that something that is more than a one year item? And are there any other items between the EBITDA line and the free cash flow line please?","Tracey Joubert","Hi, Robert. Yes. So, going into that $1.1 billion as you see lower EBITDA, there is slightly higher CapEx. And again, we'll give more detailed guidance on that in Q4. It\u2019s slightly higher than the current year that we\u2019re planning for the higher cash taxes next year. Again, I don't want to give you an absolute number. We'll talk about tax rates and that again. But we took a lot of opportunities with the tax reform last year and this year. So cash taxes, we're not going to get that benefit \u2013 going forward as bigger benefit as we got. And then the other item that I just want to mention as well is the working capital. And over the last couple of years, we've got tremendous opportunities that we've delivered around our working capital. And that's just getting more and more difficult to be able to deliver the same kind of quantum on there. So I would say that's the other missing piece for consideration on the free cash flow.","Robert Ottenstein","Great. And then Gavin, just kind of big picture looking at the whole plan, which is I think something that a lot of people have been talking about for a while. The one piece that that seems to be missing or potentially missing is any kind of rationalization of the brewery footprint. Now that you're looking at North America as a whole and you're building out some of the large breweries in Canada and you're building, you're updating Golden. Can you give us your current thoughts on the brewery footprint over the next few years and if there are opportunities there to optimize the system? Thank you.","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks, Robert. Look, I mean, as I've said before, we routinely evaluate our optimal footprint by capacity and efficiency and we're going to continue to do that as the business required. But you\u2019re right. I mean the fact that reforming one North American supply chain team under Brian's leadership is going to allow us to make decisions that are more streamlined, that are more coordinated and more effective and they\u2019re more quick.","Robert Ottenstein","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Steve Powers","Thank you also for the follow-up. Just qualitatively on the restructuring and the reorganization efforts, clearly that's a funding source for you and a capability enabler longer-term. But near-term, does it actually complicate some of the revitalization efforts just by adding one more big initiative to the organization's plates? And I guess, if so, how do you manage that? You spoke to the complexity of managing sort of beyond beer initiative, but just more tactically, how do you manage the potential distraction of the restructuring and the reorganization itself? Thanks.","Tracey Joubert","Right. I mean, there's no doubt, Steve, that in the short-term it will be a little distracting. I would say that our restructuring is less focused on the front end of the business and larger on the back end of the business, which is a positive. So our objective is to make sure that our retail customers and our distributor network are as little impacted as possible. But we're going to move with great speed and hope to get this done in quite quick order. Obviously, there are some things which will take longer to do than others. Sure, it's hard, but not changing, not really an option for us because we want to make sure that we have the funding resources for the future and we believe that this plan does exactly that.","Steve Powers","Okay. Thank you very much.","Gavin Hattersley","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Gavin Hattersley for any closing remarks.","Gavin Hattersley","Well, thanks very much Steven. And if there are any additional questions that we weren't able to answer today, Tracey and I are planning to meet with many of you over the next few weeks to answer any clarifying questions that you may have. And in the meantime, you can always contact Mark Swartzberg if there are any more technical questions that you want to ask. So just in closing, I'm very excited about the plan that we've outlined. We're going to take more calculated risks. We're going to move fast. We're going to diversify our portfolio beyond beer. We are going to put the investment behind our iconic brands and our people and our capabilities in a way that we just simply haven't done before. We think we've got the ideas. We think you're seeing the breakthrough marketing that we can come with. And we believe that this plan can get us back to consistent topline growth over the medium-term. So thanks very much for your attention today.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

With me this morning are Tracey Joubert; the CEOs of each of our business units; Lee Reichert, our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; and Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller. Today, Tracey and I will take you through our plans to drive long-term total shareholder returns, highlighting our fourth quarter and full year results and discussing our outlook for the business. And you can also find related slides on the Investor Relations page of our website.","We accomplished much in 2018. We delivered strong free cash flow and we met our deleverage commitments. We restored underlying EBITDA growth in the quarter and the second half, and we continue to premiumize our portfolio across our regions, including launching Truss, our Canadian cannabis beverages JV, scaling volume and profitability in our fast growing international business and continuing to strengthen our European business. Through the year we further scaled our cost saving program, which insulated us in part from the effects of weaker industry demand in North America, higher-than-anticipated inflationary pressures and challenges associated with the implementation of our U.S. brewery supply chain system.","We entered 2019 with a U.S. commercial plan focused on mix and share improvement, that\u2019s fully resourced and showing early signs of impact against Coors Light, a commercial strategy that is working in Europe and International and continually improving commercial trends in Canada. We are focused on further strong free cash flow delivery and deleverage supported by more than $200 million of cost savings in 2019 and further $450 million across savings across 2020 to 2022. We remain committed to our plan to reinstitute a dividend payout ratio in the range of 20% to 25% of annual trailing underlying EBITDA, upon achieving around 3.75x leverage, which we expect to occur in the middle of 2019.","Against this backdrop of progress and commitments, let me share more about what you can expect from our strategy of earning more, using less and investing wisely, before handling the call to Tracey to elaborate on the quarter, the year and our outlook. In terms of earning more, we will continue to build even stronger commercial excellence capability with a focus on portfolio premiumization and disruptive growth that drive mix improvements. Almost 20% of our volume is comprised of above premium brands and this figure continues to grow, and we see considerable headroom for added growth in all of our markets.","In international, we entered 2019 with an optimum cost structure, improved brand profitability and a portfolio of above premium brands gaining strength in our focused markets. In Europe, our strategy of strengthening our core national champion brands while premiumizing the portfolio has well developed and working. In Canada, industry trends have been challenging, where our total share trend has improved three quarters in a row and pricing continued to show positive improvement. We will continue to improve Coors Light share trends while premiumizing the portfolio and preparing for the launch of our Truss portfolio.","In U.S., while we were dissatisfied with the 2018 top line and share performance, we also believe we have the strategy people in commercial execution to drive improving performance in 2019 and the longer-term. We anticipate further contraction of the U.S. beer industry volumes, which we plan to offset by adding resources to accelerate our portfolio premiumization and improve our industry volume share trends.","Using less is our second platform and is designed to fuel growth and protect our bottom line performance. We are overdelivering on our regional cost savings plans for 2017 through 2019, allowing us to offset inflation and protect marketing investment. And as Tracey will cover, we expect to unlock another $450 million of savings over the period 2020 through 2022. These savings are driven by our sustainable productivity driving initiatives such as world-class supply chain 2.0, our greenfield breweries in Canada, global business services, new IT programs and their ongoing procurement efforts and more rigorous ZBB across the entirety of our business.","Investing wisely is our third platform, and you knew our commitment to deleverage and increase cash returns. Similarly, we\u2019re committed to spending our marketing dollars more effectively than ever by scaling investment behind accelerated portfolio premiumization and through this full adoption of ROMI approach and increasing sophistication of our investment planning. I also want to highlight that our spending is often understated by third-party aggregators, reflecting our shift of increasing amounts of digital and experiential platforms.","So with that backdrop over to you, Tracey.","Tracey Joubert","Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. Before I share consolidated and regional financial highlights, I\u2019d like to remind you of the new revenue recognition accounting standards effective from the beginning of 2018, which we\u2019ll refer to you as revenue recognition for the remainder of the prepared remarks today.","As outlined in our earnings release, revenue recognition had no significant impact to net income for the full year, but this caused some timing differences between quarters, positively impacting EPS by $0.04 this quarter and impacting some year-over-year comparability for net sales and MG&A primarily in the U.S. and Canada this quarter. Please refer to our SEC filings for more detail.","Separately, you may have noticed that we filed an 8-K this morning, indicating that we restated our 2016 and 2017 financial statements for a technical income tax accounting measure related to the acquisition of the remaining 58% of MillerCoors in 2016 and subsequent remeasurements of deferred tax in 2017 resulting from the recent U.S. tax reform. These restatements did not have an impact on our reported underlying pretax income, underlying earnings this year or underlying free cash flow for 2016 and 2017 as these issues related to assets that we previously excluded.","Further, such corrections do not impact our anticipated future cash tax benefits resulting from acquisitions, future effective tax rates or otherwise indicative of the underlying performance of the business. Please refer to our SEC filings for more detail.","I will speak to the quarter and year on a consolidated and regional basis and also our outlook. We continue to see some of the same pressures in the fourth quarter as we did during the first three quarters of the year, mainly industry decline in North America as well as inflation in the U.S. Our fourth quarter results were also impacted by the timing of inventory levels in the U.S., which drove a further reduction in our financial volume over brand volume. However, these metrics largely converged for the full year.","While these negative factors had an unfavorable impacts on our top line results for the quarter, we exercise flexibility and discipline in the P&L, and as a result, delivered underlying EBITDA growth of 3.9% on a constant currency basis. This was driven by positive global net pricing, brand volume growth and underlying business performance in Europe and international, cost savings and cost mitigations as well as reductions in our MG&A expenses.","The full year results were impacted by the same factors and were further adversely impacted by cycling the indirect tax reserve provision in Europe, which drove the decrease in underlying EBITDA of 1.5% on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., we grew underlying EBITDA of 6.4% in the quarter, driven by lower MG&A expenses, higher net pricing and favorable impacts of the revenue recognition standard, partially offset by lower volumes, cost inflation and negative sales mix.","Lower MG&A expenses were due to spending optimization and efficiencies as well as lower employee-related expenses, including incremental cost reductions related to the restructuring initiated in the third quarter and lower employee incentive expenses. Overall, U.S. brand volumes declined 5.1% on a trading day adjusted basis for the quarter and domestic sales-to-wholesalers declined 8.9%, in part due to quarterly timing of wholesale inventories, which ended 2018 at normal levels of inventory.","In the quarter, our brand volumes remained below industry trends. However, we made progress with our top priority Coors Light, as a brand reversed its negative segment share trend and launched its new marketing campaign at the end of the quarter, reintroducing our cold-activated packaging to a whole new generation of legal age drinkers. Miller Lite increased share of Premium Light for 17th consecutive quarter, while holding total beer industry share according to Nielsen. As that premium performed below our expectations, we\u2019re quite positive about our 2019 plans to accelerate premiumization of the portfolio.","Our full year U.S. underlying EBITDA decreased 1.5% driven by lower volume, higher cost as a result of higher transportation cost, aluminum inflation and volume deleverage as well as negative sales mix partially offset by lower MG&A expenses and higher net pricing. However, we delivered high single-digit underlying EBITDA growth in the second half due to improved sales-to-wholesaler trends, accelerated NSR per hectoliter growth in the fourth quarter and the incremental cost-reduction initiatives executed.","On a full year basis, brand volume and STW is largely converged, and brand volume declined 3.9% and STW declined 4.4%. For the year, we gained market share within the Premium Light segment while our economy brands gained segment share and held share of total beer industry according to Nielsen. In above premium, we established the foundation for growth by successfully introducing Arnold Palmer Spiked, established Peroni as the fastest-growing European import and relaunched the Sol brand, while our regional craft brand growth continue to far outpace that of the craft segment.","In Europe, underlying EBITDA decreased 7.8% in local currency in the quarter, and this was due to lapping last year\u2019s partial release of a bad debt provision and the adoption of our revised industry guidelines for calculating excise tax in one of our major European markets. We also continue to invest in our First Choice Agenda during the quarter, adding to the growth in our volume and brands mix.","Brand volume increased 3.3%, reflecting improved performance of our global, above premium and national champion brand portfolios. We have also continued to expand the reach of our business geographically through our European export and license team, improving tax and increasing our absolute volume, royalty income and profit, although this does dilute our NSR per hectoliter.","Our European export and license business now represents approximately 8% of our Europe brand volume, and we expect its strong growth to continue. Full year underlying EBITDA in Europe decreased 8.2% in local currency, primarily due to the reversal of the indirect tax provision in 2017 that was up 4.3% excluding the effects of this reversal.","Our European business grew brand volume 2.2% as well as improved its brands mix. Global brands, above premium and national champion brand portfolios all grew and more than offset losses in the value category as we executed our strategy to premiumize our portfolio. We also expanded our portfolio through the acquisition of the Aspall Cider brand portfolio and are currently performing ahead of our acquisition business case. We also continued our disciplined approach towards optimizing marketing investments at cost control.","In Q4, our Canada underlying EBITDA decreased 12% in local currency driven by lower volumes, negative sales mix, one-time supply chain inventory write-offs and inflation, partially offset by cost savings and a 2.7% increase in net sales per hectoliter in local currency before revenue recognition. MG&A, excluding the impact of revenue recognition was effect in local currency.","Brand volume decreased 2% as the result of lower volumes in the West and Ontario, partially offset by growth in Quebec. The introduction of Miller High Life early in the year and growth from Coors Banquet and Belgium Moon was more than offset by declines from other brands, including Coors Light and Molson Canadian.","Full year underlying EBITDA in Canada decreased 4.1% in local currency, driven by lower volumes, negative sales mix, onetime supply chain inventory write-offs and inflation, partially offset by cost savings and a 0.9% increase in net sales per hectoliter in local currency before revenue recognition. MG&A excluding the impact of revenue recognition was up 2.3% in local currency.","Brand volume decreased 2.2%, driven by industry declines in the West. The introduction of Miller High Life and growth from Belgian Moon were more than offset by declines from other brands, including Coors Light and Molson Canadian. Our total share trend has improved three quarters in a row, and Coors Light share of segment also improved three quarters in a row, improving to flat in the fourth quarter.","In International, underlying EBITDA on a constant currency basis improved by $3.1 million in the quarter, driven by increased profitability to a shift to local production in Mexico, higher brand volume in our focus markets and lower MG&A. This was partially offset by unfavorable sales mix. Brand volume increased 1.1%, driven by organic growth in our focus markets, led by Miller Lite, Blue Moon and Miller High Life. Net sales per hectoliter decreased 18% in constant currency, driven by the shift to local production in Mexico in favor of a license model, resulting in higher margin.","Our International business has increased its profitability substantially over the past year as we improved underlying EBITDA by approximately $19 million on a constant currency basis to $22.5 million, driven by the same factors as in the fourth quarter as well as improved profitability of our International focus brands: Coors Light, MGD and Miller Lite.","Brand volume increased 2.2%, driven by organic growth in our focus markets, led by Miller High Life, Miller Lite and Blue Moon. Net sales per hectoliter decreased 6% in constant currency as the shift to local production in Mexico occurred as planned during the second half of the year.","Now moving to outlook. Our earnings release provides full details of our guidance. As Mark stated, we remain committed to our plan for rating agency leverage of approximately 3.75 times EBITDA around the middle of 2019, and the dividend intentions and EBITDA margin expansion guidance we communicated in June are unchanged.","In terms of cost savings, we remain confident in the $700 million of savings for the three years ending 2019 and now also plan an added $450 million for the period 2020 through 2022. Procurement and supply chain, including brewery optimization, constitute the majority of these new savings, with IT and global business services also contributing to the $450 million. We expect these savings to help fund our internal investment plans and the cost of achieving the savings as well as offset input inflation spread evenly over the period 2020 through 2022.","We expect our International business to deliver a strong double-digit percentage increase to underlying EBITDA in constant currency for the full year 2019. We estimate an underlying free cash flow of $1.4 billion, plus or minus 10%, this year. We believe the main components of the difference between the midpoints of our estimates and consensus are lower estimates of capital spending, remember, we are still optimizing our brewery footprint in Canada; and high estimates of cash taxes paid as a result of onetime opportunities realized with tax reform in 2018.","We are no longer communicating guidance on cost of goods sold per hectoliter by business unit in favor of estimated cost of goods sold trends on a total company basis. And of course, the U.S. remains the biggest driver of our cost of goods sold. And in 2019, we expect U.S. cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a similar rate to our estimated consolidated percentage increase of up mid-single digits.","This amount reflects changes on aluminum and other key inputs and is per hectoliter and is on a constant currency basis versus 2018. As shared earlier, our U.S. distributors ended 2018 with typical levels of inventory. This was below what we expected on our last earnings call due to lower-than-anticipated inventories outside of the Milwaukee brewery orbit. Milwaukee did see the expected build in preparation for the February go-live. We expect to complete implementation of our new ordering system across our U.S. brewery network over the course of this year and foresee shipments converging with STRs for the year. Keep this in mind as you consider quarterly phasing in 2019.","In November, we announced that we reached a settlement, amicably resolving all outstanding issues in the Pabst case. And as you know, these terms are confidential. The original contract still has a number of years to run and, for the near term, has not changed.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mark.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Tracey. Earning more is one of the three platforms by which we drive PACC, and this pillar is built on our First Choice Commercial Excellence approach. I\u2019d like to give you some evidence of that by region, followed by a few comments on the increasing potential of our enterprise growth actions.","In the U.S., Miller Lite continues its strong segment trend, while Coors Light\u2019s relative performance improved, with the brand holding share of segment in Q4. In 2019, we have plans to accelerate our above premium portfolio through higher investment. We plan to double our media spend on Blue Moon, the number one national craft brand; air national advertising for Peroni for the first time; and build on a very successful year one for both Arnold Palmer Spiked and Sol.","We\u2019ll also increase Henry\u2019s Sparkling presence in the fast-growing hard seltzer category, focusing on the brand\u2019s clear product differentiators of zero sugar and only 88 calories, and introduce a number of innovations, including Cape Line, Saint Archer Gold, Crispin extensions and Sol Chelada, all before the summer. Our U.S. business enters 2019 having further strengthened its position as the trusted category captain across chain accounts in both the off and on-premise.","And more broadly, our customer excellence performance is market-leading and improving further, as evidenced by the Advantage Survey results. And allied to this, we\u2019ve ramped up our e-commerce approach within joint business plans and continue to build competitive advantage through our technology-enabled field sales teams with tools such as BeerMate, which we are now rolling out globally.","We\u2019re also thrilled to welcome Michelle St. Jacques as the new Chief Marketing Officer and Brian Erhardt as our new Chief Integrated Supply Chain Officer for the U.S. business. Our new Coors Light advertising is now on air, and we know we are moving in the right direction with the brand, allowing us to take even more share in premium lights. Coors Light will continue to emphasize its cold Rocky Mountain positioning as the world\u2019s most refreshing beer.","We\u2019ll also invest more than ever on digital and social channels to engage and recruit 21 to 34-year-old drinkers. Miller Lite, the original light beer with less carbs and calories, will further enhance its competitive messaging to drive greater consumer affinity and brand switching from its major competitor.","In Europe, we continue to move in the right direction. Our brand volumes are growing and premiumizing. Our national champion portfolio inflected to positive volume growth last year. Our global brands continued to grow well in excess of industry, and our above premium and craft portfolio also contributed to growth and mix. Our First Choice for Customer focus is also strengthening our customer relationships.","For example, according to the Advantage Survey of UK retailers, we rate number one in the multiple on-trade across all beverage suppliers. We\u2019re delighted our national champion brands in Europe had such a solid year, and we still aim for more. Our largest brand, Carling, has just begun a major new 360 degree campaign called Made Local, which started this month and will continue through 2019 and continue to strengthen the brand\u2019s market-leading position.","Finally, in Europe, we\u2019re exporting and licensing our brands to multiple new markets. We\u2019re generating increasing profit from this business and are excited about its future because it\u2019s low capital intensity and offers considerable room for growth. our First Choice Commercial Excellence approach and capability is building in Canada, too.","As I mentioned earlier, in terms of commercial performance, there are multiple highlights. Our total share trend has improved three quarters in a row, and Coors Light\u2019s segment share also improved three quarters in a row, improving to flat in the fourth quarter. Craft volume grew, driven by Belgian Moon and Creemore, and our non-alcoholic portfolio of Coors Edge and Heineken 0.0 is delivering strong volume and segment share growth. In the value segment, we delivered strong share growth, driven by our simplified portfolio strategy and the launch of Miller High Life.","As we look at 2019 and beyond, we\u2019re excited by the potential we see from our innovation pipeline. Coors Slice, for example, is an innovation that strengthens the Coors trademark. And we\u2019re encouraged by the tests behind our pending introduction of Aqua-Relle, our hard sparkling water.","Our commitment to customer excellence includes the adoption of BeerMate to strengthen field sales management and promising joint business plan pilots with key customers. For example, a pilot with Ontario\u2019s LCBO is producing beer category growth well in excess of the total industry performance. Our two largest brands will benefit from new advertising, brand redesign and innovation in 2019.","For Coors Light, we\u2019ll launch our new The Mountains are Calling campaign and introduce new packages, including a new chill pack in time for summer, and the Molson trademark enters 2019 with a new brand redesign and communication platform expected to unlock latent passion for the brand.","The Miller trademark returned to our portfolio in 2016, and we plan to build on a very successful 2018, building awareness and distribution of Miller High Life since its launch early last year and adding to the success of MGD and other non-U.S. markets by expanding the brand\u2019s availability and above premium positioning.","Now as you know, the MillerCoors transaction also gave us the opportunity to get bigger internationally. In 2017, we began executing plans for improving our portfolio, route-to-market and profitability simultaneous with undertaking the structural changes, adding approximately $100 million in revenue to this business.","Last year was year one of our new International strategy, targeting focus markets and implementing the many actions of dramatically improved profitability. These include our shift to local production in Mexico; favorable changes in the pricing of Coors Light, MGD and Miller Lite and accelerated growth of Blue Moon and Miller High Life; and standout performance at retail. International\u2019s recent wins include MGD, capturing leadership of Paraguay\u2019s premium segment; our new Blue Moon Tap House in Panama, the first of many; and strong growth across our portfolio in Latin America and India.","Looking forward, our International business will remain committed to top and bottom line growth, driven by continued focus on portfolio mix improvements, building capabilities to expand within our priority markets and potential strategic entry into new markets.","Now clearly, we\u2019re more than the sum of our regions, and our Enterprise Growth Team is helping our business unlock that value through our global brands, customer excellence and disruptive growth. Our global brands span many markets and still have enormous potential. Coors Light continues to show very strong volume growth in Europe and is contributing to an improvement in region profits in Mexico, where we\u2019ve reduced promotional intensity.","Miller Lite\u2019s responding positively to the change to its original white packaging in over 20 markets. And MGD and Miller High Life are showing significant growth outside of their home markets from LatAm to Europe to India. Staropramen outside of Czech Republic continues to grow strongly across Europe, responding positively to its new visual identity with consistent messaging.","And finally, Blue Moon continues to grow in multiple markets, and we expect it to return to growth in the U.S. this year. There are many examples of our success delivering customer excellence, from the rollout of BeerMate to the introduction of our B2B online platform, to the use of advanced analytics to drive category growth, to embedding our e-commerce approach into joint customer business plans. And this approach has been recognized through multiple customer surveys across North America and Europe.","Innovation and disruptive growth represents approximately 7% of our net sales. We continue to reenergize our core brands, expanding to new occasions, including low and no alcohol. We also continue to expand the footprint of our portfolio into new and emerging segments such as sparkling cocktails and hard sparkling water.","Additionally, we have a range of initiatives such as Truss, which we expect to launch its non-alcoholic, cannabis-infused beverages portfolio in the fall of 2019, following legalization in Canada; the expansion of Blue Moon tap rooms; and our entry into markets such as kombucha.","All of these initiatives are underpinned by continuous investment in our brewing capability and R&D. Finishing on PACC and our efforts to drive shareholder value. We\u2019re pleased to be deleveraging at the pace we committed to, and we look forward to upping our cash returns to shareholders later this year, continuing our balanced approach to capital allocation and unlocking the top line opportunities in front of us through our First Choice for Consumer and Customer agenda.","Thanks for your time and attention so far today. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mark.","Mark Swartzberg","Thank you, Mark, and good morning again, everyone. Just a bit of housekeeping. We look forward to meeting with many of you over the course of the year, and various corporate accents events are scheduled for the year. I also want you to know we plan to host an investor event similar to the one held historically in June every two to three years.","Now between such meetings, we plan to continue our many other forms of corporate access, including headquarter visits, field trips, non-deal roadshows and broker conferences. So I wanted to take care of that housekeeping item. And I think, Gary, if you\u2019re ready, we\u2019ll open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Mark, Tracey, I was hoping if you can bridge your assumptions for the 2019 free cash flow guidance. Why are you assuming for pricing in 2019, particular for the U.S., as I believe one of your competitors is moving their pricing earlier this year to April?","And the second question is on the clarification of gauge on the cost save. Is it being reported like going forward, I think starting in 2020, as part of underlying? So are you moving to a GAAP reporting for EBIT? And can you give us an idea or the cost to achieve those additional $450 million in savings? Like I know you probably had about $230 million, if I\u2019m doing the math right, to achieve the $700 million by the end of next \u2013 the end of this year. So can you give us like the costs, the expected costs to achieve the $450 million? Thank you.","Mark Hunter","Hi, Andrea, it\u2019s Mark here. I think there was probably three question areas in there, free cash flow, pricing and cost savings. So Tracey, do you want to just talk about free cash flow? And then, Gavin, do you want to talk about our pricing position in the U.S.? And then we\u2019ll come back and cover cost savings. So Tracey, just on free cash flow.","Tracey Joubert","Yes, so our free cash flow guidance, Andrea, for 2019 is $1.4 billion, plus or minus 10%. That does include the cost savings that we have communicated for this year getting to $700 million. I think your question on \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that I understand the U.S. GAAP EBIT question, but let me answer the $450 million of cost savings.","And the cost architecture includes both CapEx and OpEx, and those will be including \u2013 included in underlying. So in the past, when we stated cost savings and synergies, there was a portion that was included \u2013 that wasn\u2019t included in underlying. Those were onetime costs. But going forward, the CapEx and OpEx will be included in all the underlying guidance that we give you.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Tracey. The other thing just to mention on our free cash flow, obviously, the free cash flow excludes any asset disposals, and we anticipate disposing of our Montreal brewery after 2019. So that will be additional cash to help support deleverage but not reported within our free cash flow. And we\u2019ll update you on that as we conclude that process a little bit later this year.","Gavin, do you want to pick up on pricing and the pricing environment within the U.S.?","Gavin Hattersley","Sure, Mark, thanks, and good morning, Andrea. Let me just say, first off, that from a pricing point of view, it\u2019s been fairly consistent over many years in the sort of 1% to 2% range. We\u2019re particularly pleased with the progress that we made on pricing in 2018. And Q4 was a good quarter for us from a net revenue perspective. Sales mix remains a big focus area for us. We were down 70 basis points in the fourth quarter. And obviously, our focus and a lot of our efforts is going towards premiumizing our portfolio in 2019 and improving the overall sales mix of our U.S. business unit.","From a pricing point of view, Andrea, I would point to you again that pricing has been fairly consistent over the years. We evaluate our pricing on a market-by-market basis. We price our product in the best interest of the brands to optimize revenue in each and every market. So we evaluate competitive pricing, but we don\u2019t share our strategies overall publicly.","Mark Hunter","Okay. Thanks, Gavin. Thanks, Tracey. Andrea, thanks for your questions. Hopefully, we managed to cover all parts of that. Gary, back to you.","Operator","The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Dara Mohsenian","Hi, guys.","Mark Hunter","Good morning.","Dara Mohsenian","If I look at your MG&A line in the U.S. in the last couple of years, it\u2019s down about 30%, which is a pretty large decrease in that line item. So can you give us some kind of sense for how much of the decline is due to lower advertising spend in the U.S., particularly given Mark\u2019s comment alluding to the available third-party data sometimes missing some of your spending on digital or other areas?","And then second, as we think going forward, you\u2019ve obviously talked about your desire to improve U.S. market share and volume trends. There\u2019s a more aggressive innovation cycle and marketing levels from your key competitors in the U.S. Some of that is even targeted directly at your brand. So going forward, do you think you need to redo spending significantly behind the U.S. business, either in advertising, R&D or any other areas going forward? Thanks.","Mark Hunter","Let me pick that up. And Gavin, I\u2019ll try and hit the high spots, and let me know if I missed anything. I mean, if you look at our MG&A line across our business, not just the U.S., we\u2019ve been working very hard in two fronts. One is to make sure that we\u2019ve got a cost base that\u2019s set for the future. And we\u2019ve taken some significant steps right across our business and, obviously, through the second half of 2018 to actually reduce our overall cost base. And we\u2019ve been working really hard at removing or reallocating what we describe as nonworking marketing dollars and really getting that right at the front end of our business. That\u2019s allowed us to actually take some reductions in some marketing spend. But we don\u2019t break that out by region because it\u2019s competitively sensitive.","And linked to your second part of your question, the focus in our business is making sure that we\u2019ve got marketing or advertising that\u2019s really working for us. And it\u2019s clear, as we came through 2019, that we were suboptimal with two or three of our brands in the U.S. So the focus is less on incremental spending but much more on making sure that we\u2019ve got work that really connects with consumers and changes behavior. And there\u2019s plenty of examples of brands in the marketplace that have increased their spending and that had no impact on their overall brand performance. We\u2019re very focused on specification of our targeting, the productivity of our marketing investment and the strength of our creative work.","And 2018, I think, demonstrated that we still have some improvements to make, and I think that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re excited about Michelle joining our team. And she\u2019s on board and, I believe, will have a big impact on the quality of our marketing work in the U.S. But Gavin, anything else you would add to that? Or have I covered all the bases?","Gavin Hattersley","Well, I think you covered all the bases there, Mark. Maybe I can just add in Q4 specifically. Obviously, we had the restructuring, which we talked about in the last earnings call, and obviously, we had \u2013 we\u2019ve had employee-related cost reductions as a result of that. And then, of course, we didn\u2019t have a particularly good year last year. We had smaller \u2013 or much smaller annual incentive payments to employees, which also would have reduced MG&A in the fourth quarter.","Mark Hunter","Okay. Thanks, Gavin.","Dara Mohsenian","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Judy Hong","Thank you. Good morning. So, I guess, my question is just in terms of the U.S. beer industry volume trends. Clearly, second year in a row that I think volume had gotten worse. And it sounds like maybe 2019, you don\u2019t really expect things to get better. So I just want to understand how you\u2019re thinking about the industry volume trends playing out in 2019.","And then, for kind of in this reality of persist volume declines for the industry, how does that shape your strategy going forward because a lot of the things that I think you\u2019re talking about, I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s meaningfully different than what we\u2019ve kind of heard in the past. So I guess, I\u2019m just wondering strategically over the next few years how should that strategy evolve if we\u2019re going to see the industry continuing to see volume decline 1% to 2%.","Mark Hunter","Let me start with the second part of your question. And Gavin, do you want to just offer a perspective around kind of the industry drivers?","The second part of your question, Judy, I would come back to, really, the continued expansion of the margin pull or the revenue pull in the U.S. So yes, there\u2019s pressure on volume, but consumers are drinking slightly less, but better for one of a headline, and that means that our strategy in terms of our portfolio has got to be accelerated premiumization of that portfolio. That\u2019s what we indicated that we were leaning into very hard as we go in \u2013 came into 2018, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve made additions to our above-premium portfolio and that\u2019s why I indicated on my script earlier that we\u2019re doubling down on in particular, Peroni, Blue Moon and Sol, as well as our innovation agenda.","So it\u2019s no different to what we\u2019ve done in our European business over a number of years, where we\u2019ve consistently reshaped the portfolio. I mean, in our European business, we are close to 30% of our volume is in above premium. We are underrepresented in above premium. And while we continue to protect, defend and stabilize our large brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite, we must accelerate the pace of premiumization in our portfolio. So that\u2019s second part of your question in terms of our response.","Gavin, do you want to talk about just the drivers on the beer industry more generally?","Gavin Hattersley","Sure, Mark. Good morning, Judy. Look, I mean, our estimates are aligned with yours, right, which is at the full year 2018, industry trend was pretty similar to that 2017. Some of the bigger drivers, the overall health of the industry is the weakness of the biggest brand, Bud Light, Miller Lite, Coors Light and obviously, Mark has talked a little bit about what we\u2019re doing there. Growth in wine and spirits has continued.","And as an industry, we need to be pro-beer first and a lot of our innovation is focused in that particular area. Consumer demographics continue to evolve whether it\u2019s styles, whether it\u2019s flavors, and we, obviously, you need to resonate with those consumers. And again, our innovation is focused there. I think the beer industry has become increasingly fragmented with a significant number of new SKUs that have been added in recent years and that\u2019s creating confusion in retail, and our big chain customers are recognizing that and are dialing back on the proliferation of SKUs. And then there\u2019s a whole host of other micro cuts. As to what we\u2019re doing about it, but I think Mark covered that of in enough detail. But our focus is, obviously, Miller Lite and Coors Light and driving strong growth in above premium.","Judy Hong","Okay. And Gavin, just o ne clarification, the STW versus STR. So the fact that outside of Milwaukee, the inventory came down, does that reverse in 2019? Or is it just a reality of maybe a lower STR trend? And then the higher inventory levels in the Milwaukee brewery, does that also reverse? So net-net, we\u2019re looking at a wash just in terms of inventory levels in 2019?","Gavin Hattersley","Yes. Look, Judy, I think what \u2013 I think the message you should take away from an inventory point of view is we always and drive convergence between sales-to-wholesalers and sales-to-retailers, and this year won\u2019t be any different. There will be moves, obviously, Milwaukee will come down. But Albany will go up as we get ready for the Albany rollout. So there\u2019ll be an increase in net overturn as we then rollout to Irwindale that\u2019ll elevate during that particular period of time. But from a full-year perspective, I think the message is we try and drive convergence between those two.","Judy Hong","Got it. Thanks.","Mark Hunter","And Gavin, just building on that, Judy, I think we were pretty as we come through 2018, and that\u2019s what we expected to occur on a full year basis in 2018 with STWs and STRs converging by the year-end, and they did do that. The encouraging thing is as we\u2019ve started 2019, certainly, based on all of the news and data, the trends from an STR perspective for the MillerCoors portfolio are \u2013 have improved materially versus what we saw in the fourth quarter.","Judy Hong","Understood. Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Robert Ottenstein","Great, I think you\u2019ve kind of got to what I was going to ask. So just really talking about the Q4 in the U.S. surprisingly \u2013 a little bit surprisingly weak, was that more a function of your business or the industry? And again, you just sort of touched on it. The \u2013 some of the standard data is better in January, the beer producers NBWA index was positive kind of the best reading in sometime in January.","Can you give us any sense of how we should kind of be looking at these various data points in terms of what\u2019s going on? Were there calendar issues? Issues of holidays? Issues with the weather? Just trying to get a better feel of what\u2019s actually going on with the U.S. market over the last four months. Thank you.","Mark Hunter","Gavin, do you want to dive into some of the detail around that?","Gavin Hattersley","Sure, yes. Hi, Robert. Look, I think there\u2019s obviously a number of factors that drove our third quarter performance and industry overall. Some of them were duplicative. So the industry did have a fairly meaningful price increase in the fall of 2018, which drove some loading into Q3 and the industry felt a fall out of that in Q4. The overall beer industry, Robert, in the fourth quarter was pretty weak. We actually improved our overall share trends in Q4 versus where we were in Q3. And then, of course, we probably, which is related to us, had a large restructuring, which was surely disruptive to our own internal system.","As Mark said, the fourth \u2013 the first sort of six weeks are interesting. I mean, obviously, we\u2019ll have to see how it transpires over the course of the full quarter. But we\u2019re very encouraged by the results for both the industry and for MillerCoors. And if you take the last four months from October through January, industry is performing pretty similarly to that, which it did in the whole of 2018 and the whole of 2017.","Now according to Nielsen, our year-to-date trend has improved to down low-single digits compared to the mid-single digits we saw in Q4. Coors Light and Miller Lite are driving stronger performance with Coors Light also improving to down low-single digits, while Miller Lite, according to Nielsen, is now firmly in positive territory year-to-date, keeping pace with the industry.","So only six weeks, Robert, but we\u2019re confident in our new Coors Light marketing campaign. We think we got the right message with Miller Lite, and we\u2019ve got a really exciting lineup on premium initiatives, which we\u2019re going to execute in the first part of this year.","Robert Ottenstein","Can you give us maybe just a little bit better sense of what\u2019s going on in terms of key channels, on-trade, off-trade, for instance? Is there any particular weaknesses or strengths there?","Gavin Hattersley","I think traditionally, the on-premise has been a little weaker. Foot traffic is down a little bit. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a trend that changed in the fourth quarter in any meaningful way, Robert. Pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve been saying in the past.","Robert Ottenstein","Okay. And in terms of the encouraging results for the first six weeks of the year, do you think that\u2019s weather-related or anything that you can hang your head on?","Gavin Hattersley","Well, I\u2019m not going to get into the weather-related side of it because we have good weather and we have bad weather all over the country. I think six weeks is just about half the quarter, and we\u2019ll have to see how the quarter transpires. There were some \u2013 a few timing differences between the end of last year and the beginning of this year from an overall industry perspective, Robert. But we had some good weather weeks and we had some bad weather weeks. They will kind of wash out in the fullness of time.","Robert Ottenstein","Great.","Mark Swartzberg","Robert, this is Mark Swartzberg. To be clear, what Mark and Gavin were talking about was the Nielsen data that you have.","Robert Ottenstein","Yes.","Mark Swartzberg","So they\u2019re commenting on the data that you can draw conclusions from it as well.","Robert Ottenstein","Okay. Thank you, Mark.","Mark Swartzberg","Thanks, Robert.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Mark Hunter","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","So I just wanted to get \u2013 come back to the questions around the net leverage target for the middle of the year. And one, I guess, in the presentation, it just says leverage. So is it gross or net that you\u2019re targeting to get the 3.75?","Tracey Joubert","So this 3.75 is underrating agency calculation. So I mean, really, it\u2019s \u2013 you want to take out cash into account. But it does take a number of items, such as pension, et cetera. So yes, it\u2019s EBITDA over net debt basically.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, alright great, thank you.","Mark Hunter","Bryan, that\u2019s been consistent with how we have described it for the last three years and consistent with the commitment we gave in the middle of last year as well. So there\u2019s certainly no change there. And we are pleased with where we ended up at the year-end and very much on track to strengthen the balance sheet and continue to delever and raise our dividend as we\u2019ve indicated.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, great thank you. And then I guess, the second question I had is just relative to Brexit. Is there anything that is, I guess, contemplated in your outlook or your plans for this year that have any kind of provisions that you might have to take to the extent that you get a hard Brexit?","Mark Hunter","Let me ask Simon to pick that up. He\u2019s intimate with Brexit. He is certainly intimate with it. So, Simon?","Simon Cox","Yes. Thank you Bryan, I think it\u2019s probably important to just understand the shape of our UK business. We are very much a U.K producer for the UK market within the UK. So whilst we do import small amounts of volume on things like the Rekorderlig Cider and we do export small amounts of volume of things like Carling to tourist markets in Spain. We are, generally speaking, not really exposed to that sort of import\/export side of it. But most of the impacts would be in some of the macroeconomic things you might think about. But honestly speaking, we\u2019re not unduly concerned by Brexit.","The UK business continues to perform really strongly. We\u2019ve made sensible provisions, as you would expect still on things like managing supply chain imported goods to make sure that we don\u2019t run out of critical supply that do come from the continent. And overall, I wouldn\u2019t take it significantly into account in terms of modeling our European business.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, great. Thank you.","Mark Hunter","Thanks Bryan.","Operator","The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about the COGS per hectoliter guidance. So I think, Tracey, you said in the U.S., it sounds like you\u2019re expecting it to be in line with the overall company guidance for mid-single-digit inflation. Could you maybe help us aggregate a little bit logistics, just conceptually, because I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t give numbers, but logistics versus raw materials and also the degree which volume deleverage is playing into that? Because I just would have thought that the inflation would not have been as significant given lapping the Midwest premium dynamics and freight cost. Thanks.","Mark Hunter","You Tracey do you want to talk that?","Tracey Joubert","Yes, a couple of things to consider, Lauren. So we do have a robust hedging program in place, and we\u2019re very comfortable with our hedge position across all of our commodities. One of the things also just to consider is as we go into 2019 if you remember back in 2018 one of the biggest drivers of our aluminum cost was the Midwest premium. And the Midwest premium only significantly increased towards the back half of the first quarter of last year. So for the first bid of the year, we did have lower Midwest premium. And since then, it hasn\u2019t come down. It\u2019s still sort of in that $0.19 a pound range. So we\u2019ve got that to consider.","And then inflation from a freight point of view is still a bit of an issue. As hedging comes down to the extent the other commodities have, so we\u2019re still dealing with that. But that\u2019s why it is important as we look at our cost savings for this year is to mitigate that inflation that we are continuing to see from some of our commodity headwinds as well as the freight environment.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. And then sort of following on that, the geographic mix for cost savings, I know you talked about the $450 million plan going forward. But in terms of the 100-ish that\u2019s \"left\" for \u20182019, is it reasonable to assume that well more than half of that is flowing to the U.S.?","Mark Hunter","Yes, Lauren its Mark here. We haven\u2019t broken out geographically our cost savings program. We broke out the big drivers across procurement, IT, supply chain, et cetera. So we haven\u2019t given guidance. I mean, if you look at the shape of our business and where our costs actually reside, I think you can draw your own conclusion from where those costs should actually flow through. But we haven\u2019t given specific guidance. But I think you can do a reasonably easy kind of math exercise on that one to work that through.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. All right. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Sharma","Hi, good morning every one.","Mark Hunter","Hi, Amit. Good morning.","Amit Sharma","A couple of follow-ups and then one for Mark. Tracey, the cost saving $450 million is clear. You talked about more of those costs you achieve this will fall to in the operating. Can you give us a sense of how much of total you should have modeled for to achieve this cost? And then for Gavin. Gavin, you gave the pricing commentary. It\u2019s very market by market that\u2019s fully understood. But if you had an opportunity to take another round of pricing to follow up your competitor, are you open to that? Or is that also contingent on how you\u2019re looking at your share performance? And then I have one for Mark after these two.","Mark Hunter","Okay. So Tracey, do you want to kick off on the cost savings?","Tracey Joubert","Yes, so, I mean, we\u2019re not giving cost to achieve number just because it is going to be part of that underlying, so it is included in all of our underlying guidance including the CapEx guidance and the operating margin guidance. So it\u2019s split between OpEx and CapEx, but we are not giving detail around that.","Mark Hunter","Gavin, do want to pick up on pricing?","Gavin. Hattersley","Sure. Amit, I mean, I can\u2019t really give you anything more than I gave you earlier on, right? We don\u2019t provide forward guidance on pricing. What I can say to you is that pricing has been very consistent over the last two years. We\u2019ve been pleased with our revenue management process over the last year and you can see that demonstrated in the fourth quarter. And obviously, one of the inputs into our revenue strategy is competitive pricing. So once we assess what\u2019s going on in the competitive environment, we\u2019ll do what\u2019s best for our brands to optimize revenue.","Amit Sharma","Got it. And then, Mark, just a question for you. I mean, very clear you are focused on free cash generation and then use that to grow dividends starting next year as well. But if you look at the stock price, the market doesn\u2019t seem to be rewarding that capital allocation strategy. So just wondering, is there \u2013 is this up for debate at the Board level? Or are we pretty set on this course, at least in 2019 and 2020?","Mark Hunter","Yes, we\u2019ve had, I think, pretty good debate at the Board level and with the Finance Committee. We feel very good about the plan that we\u2019ve laid out through the first half of 2019. Clearly, if there was anything unexpected happened relative to our estimates of our business performance and our stock, then we\u2019ll obviously reengage with our Board and our Finance Committee. But we laid out a plan and we\u2019re committed to that plan. And I think one of the things that we\u2019ve endeavored to do in our business, as we kind of prepped for and executed the MillerCoors transaction and then drove through integration and deleverages to deliver on the commitments that we\u2019ve made.","And this is a commitment that we\u2019ve made because we feel that we are uncompetitive from a yield perspective, we want to reset that. But the thing to be reminded is the resetting our dividend and our competitive yield still then gives us pretty significant flexibility beyond that move. So if you look at our overall free cash flow and cost of increasing our dividend, then we still have flexibility as we get through the second half of 2019 and then to 2020. So our capital allocation strategy around brand-led growth opportunities, further balance sheet strengthening or further return of cash to shareholders will always be on the table. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s in any way undermined by our commitment to step up our dividend from the middle of 2019. So flexibility still exists beyond that commitment, Amit.","Amit Sharma","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Steve Powers","Great. Thank you very much. So Mark, if we could start with international. I think you called out an expectation for strong double-digit EBITDA growth in the international business 2019. And I was hoping if you could just expand upon the drivers there. Clearly, good progress made in 2018. But I guess, what are the big stepping blocks as you see it in 2019?","Mark Hunter","Yes. Well, obviously we changed the leadership of the international team just over a year ago. I was already stepping in and he\u2019s driven a very, very focused game plan there where we really consolidated the markets that we\u2019ve prioritized and the brands that we\u2019re driving and really worked to stepping up our partner engagement and accountability. So we have a stronger brand portfolio. We\u2019re in markets that we believe that we can go much deeper in terms of our overall brand scale. And we\u2019ve now got our cost base, I think, set for purpose that allows us to scale up the business without any significant additional cost.","So all of the volume or contribution of sites gives us opportunity to flow that through the business going forward. So really good progress. We delivered again on our commitment in 2018 in terms of the step up in our international performance, and we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to continue to generate strong double-digit EBITDA growth in that business. So again it probably took of all your glory there, but\u2026","Steve Powers","Okay. Thank you very much. Sorry, did you want to add?","Mark Hunter","No. I kind of did it earlier.","Steve Powers","Okay, very good. And then, if I could follow-up, Gavin, just netting out the comments you made in response to Judy\u2019s question, I believe, and also Robert\u2019s, can you just drill down and maybe add a little bit of clarity the anticipated cadence of STWs throughout the year relative to STR trends? I think Tracey might have mentioned it in her prepared remarks, but I missed some of it. Just when I look at all the moving parts and kind of interpret what you said earlier, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ll receive some shipment timing benefits in the first quarter and perhaps the first half before it then reverses. But I just wanted to sanity check that assumption.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Steve. Gavin, do you want to pick up?","Gavin Hattersley","Yes, sure, Mark. And Stephen, I mean, again, I\u2019ll go back to from an overall point of view, we plan for convergence between the two. We don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. I don\u2019t think Tracey gave that either. Obviously, we had some shipment challenges out of Golden last year, which are fairly well-known and our brewery rollout subsequent to that have been much more positive. So that will obviously give us some benefit in 2019 when you do a strict compare against 2018. But we are still rolling out the system. Trenton, Fort Worth breweries went live last year and they have been encouraging and much better than Golden, but that\u2019s a big system implementation and we\u2019re going to have challenges and we do.","Milwaukee and Chippewa Falls breweries just went live and they are so far \u2013 certainly, been a week, but they\u2019re so far performing better than Fort Worth, which is the one that went live before that. So we\u2019re getting more and more effective at these rollout as we do them. Lots of things change in a quarterly-by-quarterly basis, Steve, from timing of holidays, timing of shipments and so on. So we\u2019re not going to give specific guidance on that.","Steve Powers","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Mark Hunter","Steve, the only thing I would add is as you look at the first quarter, just remember that we\u2019re cycling two or three big kind of adjustments year-on-year. Last year, we had the indirect tax provision, which had flown through the benefit in 2017 and obviously, was a headwind in 2018 with some shipment challenges around the Golden go live. I think it was well documented. And the good news is how the team have responded from Golden and our go lives subsequent to then certainly have been a lot smoother. And then, obviously, they\u2019re just underlying industry performance. And as we\u2019ve talked to this year, it certainly seems to be off to a more positive start and our trends relative to market are more positive according to Nielsen as well. So just bear those in mind as you contemplate the first quarter.","Steve Powers","Yes. Thanks, Mark. That\u2019s very clear. Appreciate it .","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","The next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Vivien Azer","Hi good morning.","Mark Hunter","Good morning, Vivien.","Vivien Azer","So I really appreciate the commentary around the better trends in the U.S. in the first six weeks of the year that certainly is apparent in Nielsen. But when look at your market share and your market share came up a lot, Mark, within your and Tracey\u2019s prepared remarks. I\u2019m trying to understand like how you balance market share aspirations around Coors Light specifically, which is obviously critical to total portfolio performance relative to potential cannibalization. Because as I look at your volume share, the Coors Light improvement is apparent, but from a total company perspective, it seems like, at least in the last eight to 12 weeks, that\u2019s unfortunately been more than offset by Keystone Light.","So number one, is volume share that you\u2019re thinking of, or is it dollar share? Number two, is it market share targets for the total portfolio in addition to Coors Light? Number three, any specific commentary on the interaction between Coors Light and Keystone Light specifically?","Mark Hunter","All right, Vivian, wow. Let me try and unpack that one. So I think Gavin and I have been very consistent as we\u2019ve come through 2018 that job number one for us in the U.S. business is to start to get our volume performance to match the industry performance. That\u2019s not something we think will take six or 12 months, but it\u2019s certainly the medium-term target that we\u2019ve set for our teams, and we want to be holding our share of the U.S. industry and alongside premiumizing our portfolio. So really margining up the business. So that\u2019s as simple as I can make the objective we\u2019ve set for our U.S. team.","Clearly, part and parcel of that we have to ensure that both Coors Light and Miller Lite are outperforming the segment that they operate, and Miller Lite is there, Coors Light is moving back in that direction. And as I mentioned and below premium, overall, we have actually stabilized that position and actually took a little bit of share. In terms of the cannibalization between Keystone and Coors Light, anything you would add on that particular point, Gavin?","Gavin Hattersley","No, Mark. We\u2019ve done study after study after study on that because the question comes up periodically. And Keystone Light performance is very well in stores, where Coors Light is not even available. As a large national chain sometimes where Keystone is one of our only products there. And so there\u2019s very little interaction with Coors Light. So that\u2019s not of all what\u2019s driving it. I mean, what\u2019s driving it is and Anheuser-Busch has reacted with their economy brands on a 15-pack basis.","And so they\u2019re driving fair amount of price and value to consumers, and Keystone is going up against that strategy. So Anheuser-Busch copied us and that\u2019s impacting our economy share. From a Premium Lights point of view, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance. Miller Lite continues to grow significant share in the Premium Light segment. And Coors Light, for the last four weeks, is actually also been positive. So we\u2019re pleased with that, as I said earlier on.","Mark Hunter","Your question was about a volume share versus value sure. So job number one is getting our overall volume to match the industry trends in the U.S.","Vivien Azer","That\u2019s perfect. So just to summarize just to make sure I\u2019m hearing you guys correctly. So the strategy is to manage your volume share at the segment level. So Above Premium, Premium Light and Below Premium. And to improve your volume share within each of those segments with the ultimate aspiration of that driving total volume share gains, but you have to manage it at the segment level.","Mark Hunter","The only correction there I would make is that job number one is to get the place where our volume is matching the industry trends and holding our share in the medium-term.","Vivien Azer","Understood. Thank you so much.","Mark Hunter","Okay. Thanks, Vivien.","Operator","The next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Laurent Grandet","Yes. Good morning, Mark and Tracey. Two questions. One on Coors Light, one on cannabis. For the second one, actually, could you please update us on your Truss cannabis JV. Would you be ready to launch new and\/or test your product in Q4 and it\u2019s become legal in Canada for beverages? And what about your position regards to CBD products in the U.S.? And on Coors Light, really, I mean, what are the early positive sign you are seeing with Coors Light specifically with consumer? I\u2019m not interested in the Nielsen analysis. I\u2019d like to understand if you are seeing any consumer impact, if any are to the corn syrup and Super Bowl complaint from your competitor? Thanks very much.","Mark Hunter","Okay. Thanks, Laurent. Let\u2019s start with cannabis. Fred is here, and Fred, obviously, has overall accountability for cheering our Truss JV. So Fred, do you want to just talk about our status and expectations as we look through this year?","Fred Landtmeters","Sure. Good morning, Laurent. So we set up the Truss JV back in October last year. And from the beginning, I think we were very clear that our objective was to be ready to capture a meaningful share of the cannabis-infused beverages markets from day one of legalization. So we still expect legalization to happen in the fall of 2019 around the October time. We\u2019re currently following up on all the regulatory aspects that are coming into place. And the team are racing to get ready for day one. So they\u2019re working on the portfolio, the operational side of the business. And I think, in summary, I can say we\u2019re on track to be ready on day one.","Mark Hunter","Yes, I mean, I would add a couple of things. I think we\u2019ve got a great partner. We feel really good about the relationship. We\u2019ve got a great leader in the business in Brett Vye, a very capable team in place and the portfolio is really starting to come together. So as Fred said, we\u2019ll be on the playing field from day one and competing very hard in that marketplace. I think you asked a question about CBDs in the U.S., so the team that we had working internally on our Canada initiative have continued to work on other market opportunities.","I think it\u2019s too early to comment on the U.S. Obviously, we\u2019re watching where there\u2019s federal approval. And clearly, that\u2019s something that\u2019s important to us as we\u2019re federally regulated. So we\u2019re watching the CBD space. We\u2019ve got a team looking at it. And it\u2019s too early to comment beyond that at this point in time. On Coors Light, Gavin, do you want to pick up on Laurent\u2019s question around our competitors \u2013 competitive advertising?","Gavin Hattersley","Sure, Mark. Thanks. Good morning, Laurent. Look I mean, it\u2019s disappointing that ABI has chosen to single-handedly damage the overall health of the beer category health initiative by disparaging American farmers and natural ingredients that most brewers including themselves, I might add, use quite extensively. On the positive side, Anheuser-Busch could not have handled it as a better gift if they tried harder. Our distributors are proud. They are fiercely competitive and they lack nothing more than a good fight. And honestly, Laurent, nothing we could have done, could have fired them up so much. Our employees are just as fired up and the next few months are going to be interesting for sure.","My comments around the first six weeks obviously include pre-Super Bowl and post-Super Bowl, which was when the ad was flattered. So that was close to telling you what\u2019s going on from an individual brand point of view as I\u2019m going to do. But Coors Light is growing its market share over the last four weeks in the Premium Lights segment. We\u2019ve got a new Chief Marketing Officer, who actually joined us the day after the Super Bowl, Michelle. Mark referenced to her a little bit on the call. She\u2019s been a rising star at Kraft Heinz.","She understands what makes brands unique. She\u2019s ready to take our brands to the next level. And what she\u2019s going to bring us \u2013 bring to us is new ideas and speed. And actually, you can see the way we\u2019ve reacted and in fact, once we define that this is the route that we\u2019re going to take, we actually preempted the campaign on the Sunday and then followed it up with speed in a number of different angles over the last sort of 10 days or so and watch the space.","Laurent Grandet","Thank you very much. We appreciate your response.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Gavin.","Operator","The last question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Kevin Grundy","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Mark Hunter","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","Just as a follow-up question for Fred on the cannabis strategy. And Fred, I think the comment was you expect to gain meaningful share. So two questions here. Number one, what\u2019s the level of investment we should anticipate without putting an exact number, but just sort of order of magnitude that\u2019s going to flow through the Canadian segment as you support this effort? And then, two, with respect to strategy because, of course, your key competitors are going to be there and look to capitalize on the significant TAM as well. Can you give us a sense of how many products perhaps you intend to launch? How you handicap competitive positioning, product superiority? And as we sit here today, what gives you confidence that you\u2019ll indeed be able to succeed given what appears to be likely a crowded market? So thanks for that.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Kevin. Fred, I think there\u2019s a bundle of questions there for you.","Fred Landtmeters","Yes, the first one, Kevin, the level of investments, as you know, the cost of the Truss JV are consolidated in our Canadian results, but we\u2019re not commenting on the specific investments we\u2019re making in the JV. I think it\u2019s appropriate to say that the JV is properly funded. We\u2019re confident that we made, together with our partner, HEXO, the right level of investment to deliver a strong portfolio on day one of legalization. And I\u2019ll leave it there in terms of details to disclose.","Now the products to be launched in the marketplace, I mean, we\u2019ve got a very entrepreneurial team in place. They\u2019re working hard to get in the portfolio ready. There\u2019s a lot of emerging ideas. And I think we\u2019re in the stage now of confirming what the brands portfolio is going to look like. But we said from the beginning, you should probably think broadly in terms of beverages that can be infused with cannabis. And at this stage, we don\u2019t have many more details to disclose about specific products to be launched.","Mark Hunter","Yes, I think it\u2019s fair. It\u2019s probably around the middle of this year, we\u2019ll be in a position where we can as we start to talk to route-to-market customers, then we\u2019ll to be in a position to share more broadly the shape of our portfolio. So if you can just bear with us on that, clearly, we don\u2019t want to show our hand too early. I think it is worth just reminding people, Kevin, of the estimates around the size of the cannabis market in Canada. So anything from $7 billion to $10 billion beverages, anything from 20% to 30%. So if you take the low end estimates of that, there\u2019s a potential over time for that market to be worth around $1.5 billion. So I think with our position and knowledge of the Canadian market and the great partner we have, we\u2019re well positioned to be on the playing field from day one and to compete very effectively, and we know how to compete effectively in Canada.","Kevin Grundy","Thank you. And just the quick follow-up, a point of clarification will be it seems like you do not anticipate either further OpEx or elevated OpEx or further investment into the JV in order to support the initial rollout. Is that how we should think about it at least for 2019?","Mark Hunter","Tracey, do you want to...","Tracey Joubert","Yes, I would say that to Fred\u2019s comments not significant. We went into this joint venture really having a look at the cash required and the investment required, and we feel comfortable with the level of investment that we are going to make and the operating expenses that we\u2019re going to include. But they are not significant.","Mark Hunter","Yes, and very good.","Kevin Grundy","Thank you.","Mark Hunter","Mark, it is not available until October probably of this year. So the impact on Q4 would, I think, be relatively small. And 2020, then you\u2019ve got full year of revenue up against the full year of costs as well. So look, I think we can give more detail once we get into the marketplace, and we can see what kind of consumer reaction we get.","Kevin Grundy","Thank you, everyone. Good luck.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Hunter for any closing remarks.","Mark Hunter","Okay. Thanks, Gary. Could I just thank everybody for their interest in the Molson Coors Brewing Company. Hopefully, we\u2019ve laid out very clearly the significant progress we\u2019ve made as a company and also given you a little sense of transparency against the opportunity areas that we continue to work on to further strengthen the performance of our business and our overall shareholder return. So I look forward to catching up with people on a one-to-one basis, as per Mark\u2019s comments, and thanks again for your interest in Molson Coors.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

Please go ahead.","Mark Swartzberg","Thank you, Gary, and hello, everyone. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions, as Gary said. [Operator Instructions].","In terms of safe harbor, today's discussion includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

The company does not undertake to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars. ","So with that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Mark Hunter.","Mark Hunter","Thank you, Mark, and hello and welcome, everybody. With me on the call this morning are Tracey Joubert; the CEOs of our business units; Lee Reichert, our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; and Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller. Now before we begin, I'm sure you all saw the press release now earlier this morning announcing my retirement on September 27. It's been a privilege to serve as the Molson Coors CEO for the past 5 years, and I've thoroughly enjoyed engaging with our investors and analysts throughout our journey. This leadership change has been worked through with our Board as part of our ongoing succession planning at the executive level.","I'm genuinely excited about the future for Molson Coors and proud of what we've accomplished over the past 5 years. Our goal with the acquisition of MillerCoors and the Miller International business was to create a bigger and better company. In 2015 and 2016, we planned for and executed on the step change and transformed our scale. In 2017 through to today, we've delivered on the integration and the initial deleverage and synergy commitments made at the time of the acquisition despite higher inflation and softer industry demand than anticipated.","Along the way, we've also strengthened our culture with the introduction of our First Choice ambition and bolstered the leadership and capabilities of our people through our Commercial Excellence and World Class Supply Chain programs. As we now shift emphasis to greater focus on top line growth while remaining financially disciplined, it's an appropriate time for me to pass the baton on to Gavin to lead the company through our next chapter of continuing to energize, premiumize and modernize our portfolio and to move beyond beer with disruptive thinking. And you are already seeing some of the fruits of this work. Now while I'm happy to be able to move on to my next phase after a 36-year career and spend more time with my family in the U.K., along with the rest of the Board, I'm also very excited to see Gavin take over the reins and help successfully drive the company forward in its next chapter.","Gavin has been on the executive team for the past 7 years and is well-known to many of you as the former Molson Coors global CFO and as the leader of our U.S. business unit for the past 4 years. He knows our business, he knows you and he shares my absolute passion for our people, our brands and our success. Now our time today is focused on earnings. So for the balance of the call today, Tracey and I will take you through highlights of our second quarter 2019 results for our company along with some perspective on the second half of 2019. And related slides can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website.","After a solid start in the first 4 months of the year, May and June were challenging, reflecting unfavorable weather and weak industry demand across our major geographies, resulting in a disappointing volume performance in the quarter. Despite this backdrop, we executed our plans for incremental brand investment to drive accelerated portfolio premiumization and innovation impact across our business. Encouragingly, we delivered strong constant currency net sales per hectoliter growth of 3.7%, and our share trends improved in the U.S. and were stable in Europe. We also saw strong premium light share growth in the U.S. as Miller Lite and Coors Light each gained segment share. And this was ahead of the newly launched Coors Light \"Made to Chill\" advertising, which is focused on new drinker recruitment by dramatizing Coors Light's purpose to refresh the spirit through its mountain-cold refreshment credentials. We believe this creative platform is distinctive, disruptive and breakthrough. We also through the quarter maintained our focus on cash flow through ongoing cost savings, productivity improvements and improving our working capital.","We remain resolute on the ambition to improve our top line through increased investments in our brands, portfolio premiumization and innovation initiatives, including the launch of our Truss cannabis-infused nonalcoholic beverage portfolio in Canada later this year. We are committed to doing this while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and strengthening our quarterly dividend, which increased by 39% to $0.57 per share, in line with our target of 20% to 25% of prior fiscal year underlying EBITDA and is payable for the first time in September. And as you know, our First Choice strategy has 3 major components focused on top line, bottom line and use of cash allowing us to improve shareholder returns. Earning more is focused on improving top line growth, and we know our top line performance can improve. Encouragingly, the quarter showed our disciplined pricing across our brands and regions, positive global mix, improved share trends in the U.S., maintenance of share in the Europe, our focus on reshaping and premiumizing our portfolio and the readiness to spend against this focus.","Our use less discipline is demonstrated by enterprise productivity and cost-savings initiatives, all of which remain on track. This includes our work in Canada, where we have been brewing trials in our new British Columbia brewery and recently completed the sale of our Montr\u00e9al property and are in the early stages of building a state-of-the-art brewery in Longueuil, Quebec. I'm pleased with our progress monetizing and modernizing our brewery footprint in Canada and expect significant benefits from the upgrades we are making to our network, including more flexible capacity to meet demand, lower unit operating costs and increased supply chain efficiency. Please remember that the one-off start-up costs for the new brewery in British Columbia impacted the Q2 results in Canada.","Now more broadly in relation to using less and as former Coors Brewing Chairman, Bill Coors, once said, \"Waste is a resource that's out of place.\" Molson Coors helped pioneer the recyclable aluminum can revolution 60 years ago, and this year we're stepping up our efforts to tackle the global plastic waste crisis. Over the next 2 weeks, we will launch our Beer Print report 2019 outlining the progress made against the 2025 sustainability goals. With the release of the report, we will also launch a set of additional ambitious commitments to minimize the impact of our packaging, alongside the great work that's already underway across our responsibility, sustainability and exclusiveness agenda. And finally, alongside earning more and using less, we continue to invest wisely. As you saw in the quarter, we are investing more behind more on commercial agenda and increasing marketing and sales plan to in the per hectoliter basis and an absolute dollars in the quarter and first half. You should look for us increased spending against attractive consumer segments and brands without sacrificing our deleverage and cash return objectives. In other words, we intend to use multiple tools to deliver improving top line performance, namely higher-return commercial spend, targeted increases in brand investment and innovation and a more effective supply chain and minimizing out of stocks.","In terms of deleverage, we recently completed the sale of our Montr\u00e9al brewery for CAD 126 million, providing us with additional funds for debt paydown. And on July 15, we repaid $500 million of senior notes through a combination of cash and new commercial paper. And we expect to continue to delever, thereby, maintaining and strengthening our investment-grade credit rating.","So with that context, let me pass over to Tracey.","Tracey Joubert","Thank you, Mark, and hello, everyone. I will speak first to the quarter on a consolidated and regional basis, then to our 2019 outlook, and finally, to our capital allocation plan. So to recap the quarter, our net sales revenue decreased 2.9% in constant currency. Although we delivered strong pricing in each business unit as well as improving global mix, this was more than offset by volume declines.","Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 3.7% in constant currency. Our worldwide brand volume decreased 5.6% and financial volume decreased 7%. Our global priority brand volume decreased 4.6%. Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 6% on a constant currency basis driven by inflation, volume deleverage and increased packaging costs associated with our U.S. bottle furnace rebuild, partially offset by cost savings. Underlying MG&A increased 5.7% on a constant currency basis driven by increased brand investment and cycling of G&A benefits from the prior year. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 12.8% on a constant currency basis. Our year-to-date underlying free cash flow was $560.7 million, 15% below the prior year, driven by lower underlying EBITDA and higher cash tax payments, partially offset by lower capital expenditures and lower cash interest payments.","Now moving to our business units. In the U.S., overall industry demand was softer year-on-year, and net sales revenue decreased 2.9% driven by 6.7% decline in sales-to-wholesalers, excluding contract brewing, partially offset by net price increases. COGS per hectoliter increased 4.7% driven by inflation, volume deleverage and increased packaging costs associated with our bottle furnace rebuild, partially offset by cost savings.","MG&A increased 4.5% reflecting higher marketing investments focused on our above premium and innovation brand as well as cycling lower employee incentive expense in the prior year, partially offset by the incremental cost reductions related to the restructuring program initiated in the third quarter of 2018. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 8.2%. In the second quarter, we took share in premium light with Coors Light returning to segment share growth and Miller Lite gaining segment share for the 19th consecutive quarter and also holding industry share. Our above premium portfolio has a number of fast-growing brands, including Peroni, Sol, Arnold Palmer Spiked Half & Half and Henry's Hard Sparkling, which grew strongly and gained share of FMBs according to Nielsen. This growth was more than offset by declines from Leinenkugel Shandy family and Redd's franchise.","Blue Moon Belgian White had its best quarterly volume performance since the fourth quarter of 2017, holding industry share. And Cape Line, our new sparkling cocktail offering, has been a top 10 growth brand per Nielsen since early June. In Europe, net sales revenue decreased 2.4% on a constant currency basis due to a 6.5% decline in brand volume partially offset by strong price increases and favorable mix. COGS per hectoliter increased 7.5% in constant currency primarily driven by inflation and volume deleverage. MG&A increased 8.7% in constant currency, reflecting higher overall marketing investment focused on our national champion brand and premiumization initiatives as well as cycling last year's partial reversal of bad debt provisions. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 18.4% in constant currency. ","We knew we were facing challenging comparisons due to the 2018 World Cup and the exceptional summer weather last year, and yet the quarter was still disappointing driven by unfavorable weather and softer market demand. We remain confident in our ability to drive balanced net sales revenue growth through our strategy of investing behind our national champion brand and accelerating our premium portfolio. Despite soft demand, this strategy is resulting in net sales per hectoliter growth of 4.3% on a constant currency basis in the quarter and protection of our market share. ","In Canada, net sales revenue decreased 2.9% on a constant currency basis driven primarily by 5.1% decline in brand volume primarily due to softness in industry volume, partially offset by positive pricing. COGs per hectoliter increased 7.6% in constant currency driven by inflation and increased distribution costs, unfavorable sales mix, volume deleverage and brewery start-up costs in British Columbia, partially offset by cost savings. MG&A increased 9.5% in constant currency driven by higher overall marketing investment focused on Coors Light and Molson Canadian programming, our premiumization efforts and modernization of our portfolio through innovation as well as Truss start-up costs. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 25.4% in constant currency.","Weak industry demand drove the majority of our volume declines, with premium segment share trends continuing to improve for our Coors trademark and Molson Canadian brand. Coors trademark volume was positively impacted by the successful launch of Coors Light and growth in Coors Edge, and we continue to realize strong double-digit growth from Belgian Moon and Miller Lite. Also note, we continue to estimated Truss-related start-up costs of CAD 10 million to CAD 15 million in 2019.","In our International business, net sales revenue decreased 12.1% on a constant currency basis driven by an 11.9% decline in brand volume along with the shift to local production in Mexico. This was partially offset by price increases and a positive geography shift. COGS per hectoliter increased 7.8% in constant currency driven by inflation and sales mix changes. MG&A decreased 5.3% in constant currency driven by lower overhead costs, partially offset by higher marketing investments behind our focus brands. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 10.8% on a constant currency basis to $5.8 million.","Brand volume declined due to higher net pricing on Coors Light in Mexico and supply chain constraints related to the general election in India, partially offset by double-digit growth in several of our focus markets including Argentina, Panama and Puerto Rico. Coors Light volume were down principally because of Mexico while Miller Lite volume increased mid-single digits across all of our international markets.","Moving to outlook. Our earnings release details our guidance. We continue to expect 2019 consolidated underlying COGS per hectoliter to increase at a mid-single-digit rate on a constant currency basis. In terms of cost savings, we continue to expect a total of $700 million of savings for the 3 years ending 2019 and plan an adding $450 million for the period 2020 through 2022 to be spread evenly over that period. These savings will help fund our investment plans, the cost of achieving the saving and offset input inflation. We continue to expect our International business to deliver underlying EBITDA growth of strong double digits in constant currency for 2019 versus 2018, and we continue to estimate underlying free cash flow of $1.4 billion, plus or minus 10% this year.","Now finally, before I hand the call back to Mark, a few comments regarding our recently announced dividend increase modeling and our approach to brand support. Our next quarterly dividend, declared at $0.57 per share, is payable September 13 and brings our dividend in line with our target of 20% to 25% of prior fiscal year underlying EBITDA. We ended the second quarter with normal levels of inventory and a shift to consumption on a year-to-date basis.","Recall that Trenton and Fort Worth go live last year led to very strong STWs in the third quarter contributing to very soft STWs in the fourth quarter. We have two remaining system go lives in Albany, Georgia and Irwindale, California, and these remain on track to complete them by year-end. The inventory bulk will be limited within these brewery orbits. So for the balance of the year, we expect to shift to consumption and anticipate prior year comparisons will lead to high STW trend in the fourth quarter than the third quarter.","Our third quarter will also reflect the lapping of the favorable resolution of a U.S. vendor dispute, which was more than half of the MG&A capability in the third quarter of last year. And we will also be lapping Canada's distribution within COGS in the third quarter of last year.","Finally, North American industry conditions remain challenging, and we'll continue to spend our dollars efficiently while also increasing spending against attractive consumer segments and brands. And as Mark said, we will do so without sacrificing our deleverage and cash return objective.","At this point, I'll return the call back to Mark.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Tracey. Now as you know, our earn more focus depends upon extraordinary brands, customer excellence and disruptive growth. So looking at our brands. We continue to realize strong pricing across our business units giving us more fuel for brand investment, which is increasing to energize our core brands, premiumize and modernize our portfolio. In terms of our core brands, as I mentioned, within the U.S., we saw strong premium light share growth, and we expect this to accelerate where our new Coors Light advertising has just launched. And more on that in a second.","In terms of premiumization, global mix became positive as a result of our performance in Europe and through package mix. And though package mix in the U.S. trending unfavorably, this is partially offset by brand mix, which was positive for the first time in the U.S. since early 2018. Drivers of our premiumization progress included Staropramen and Pravha in Europe, Belgian Moon in Canada; and Cape Line, Blue Moon, Belgian White, Peroni, Henry's Hard Sparkling, Arnold Palmer Spiked Half & Half and the Sol trademark in the U.S. We also expect bolt-on M&A to continue to aid premiumization. And in Europe, we recently completed the purchases of Pardubick\u00fd Pivovar in the Czech Republic and Hop Stuff Brewery in London.","Our global brands benefited from yet more strong performance from Blue Moon and Belgium Moon in Canada, Europe and International, with Staropramen in Europe and Miller Lite in our International and Canada business growing strongly. In terms of reshaping our portfolio, we are demanding more from innovation. In hard seltzer, we're committed to building on the performance Tracey mentioned adding offerings in this segment, reflecting our confidence in the Henry's brand and the hard seltzer segment. And of course, Coors Light is our largest brand. And though we are pleased to see its premium light segment share improve in our largest market, that's simply not enough. Our new creative started running this week and Gavin, Michelle, our U.S. distributors and I are excited about \"Made to Chill\", which is focused on new drinker recruitment by dramatizing Coors Light's purpose to refresh the spirit through its mountain cold refreshment credentials. We believe the creative platform is distinctive, disruptive and break through, especially for new legal drinking age adults.","Turning to customer excellence. We continue to be a leader in category management in the U.S. as evidenced by our first place result amongst beer suppliers in the most recent annual Advantage survey and another first place on-premise result in the most recent annual CM Profit Group survey. In Central Europe, we are seeing strong growth in both major channels and our Net Promoter Score. And in Canada, we continue to help customers drive category growth as evidenced by our achievement of the Partner of the Year Award with the LCBO in Ontario.","We're also improving our intensity behind disruptive growth, premiumizing and extending our portfolio to meet the expanding area of consumer taste and occasions. In the U.S., that includes strong double-digit growth for Peroni; early success with Cape Line sparkling cocktails; encouraging test market performance from Saint Archer Gold, a premium light craft lager; Movo wine spritzers; and the pending test of La Colombe hard coffees in select markets; and the strong growth of Sol Chelada following its national introduction earlier this year. In Canada, Coors Slice, Aquarelle Hard Seltzer and Bella Amari are performing well. And in International, our portfolio was benefiting from continued expansion of Blue Moon, now available in more than 20 international markets.","Disruption also features in our route to market, presenting new service opportunities and revenue streams as we step change our digital and e-commerce capabilities across our business. We're also excited about the disruptive potential of Truss, which remains on track for a national launch of nonalcoholic cannabis-infused beverages when they're legalized in Canada later this year. For those of you less familiar with our partnership with Canada HEXO, Truss is single-mindedly focused on cannabis-infused nonalcoholic beverages. We know Truss's portfolio of brands will taste great and be scalable because of its infusion technology and flavoring capabilities within its Belleville, Ontario facility. And Truss's portfolio will meet an array of consumer occasions. Truss's CEO, Brett Vye, heads a team that's practiced in the testing, learning and scaling necessary to make Truss a success. And the combination of Molson Coors extensive beverage expertise and HEXO's innovation capabilities in cannabis give us confidence that Truss will deliver safe, consistent and great-tasting nonalcoholic beverages to meet consumer demands. On our next quarterly earnings call, we plan to discuss Truss's portfolio of brands, which well advanced currently in terms of retailer joint business planning.","So concluding on PACC and driving shareholder value. We are intensifying our focus on better top line performance and are pleased to be returning more cash to shareholders and remain committed to further deleverage, all within the context of our capital allocation framework, of strengthening our balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders and investing in brand-led opportunities through acquisitions and internal investment.","So thanks for your time and attention. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mark Swartzberg.","Mark Swartzberg","Yes. Thank you, Mark. Just to remind everyone of upcoming events. We do look forward to seeing many of you at the Barclays Global Consumer Staples Conference, where we will also host a webcast at 10:30 a.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, September 4. So with that, Gary, I think we'd like to go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets.","Amit Sharma","Mark, congratulations on -- Gavin, congratulations on your promotion. And Mark, good luck with the next phase. Can you talk about -- can you just talk about, Mark, what drove the timing of the transition at this time? And then for Gavin, as you look to take over, can you highlight some of the strategic initiatives or actions that you are considering.","Mark Hunter","Okay. Let me pick up both of those. So on the first point, I mean, there's nothing unusual. When I stepped up and took over from Peter Swinburn, we did it at the same time of the year. And it's something that we've been in discussion with our Board because it allows the incoming CEO to really impact the development of our long-range plan, And Gavin will have that opportunity. ","He'll transition with me over the course of the next couple of months through to end September, and then we have our Board of Directors meeting in September and November when we land our long-range plans. So that to give me the chance to do that when I come in for Peter, and it will give Gavin the chance to do that and now coming in to step up into my role.","So it's been an ongoing discussion with our Board, as you can imagine. I formally retired yesterday, but our conversations with the Board have been ongoing, as you would expect for executive succession. So really, that's the timing. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, '17, '18 and '19 were very clear in terms of what we wanted to get done, and it felt appropriate to manage the timing to this level and allow Gavin to drive the next chapter. ","Obviously, he's going to transition and spend time on his thinking in partnership with the executive team and the Board over the next few months. And I know he'll be ready to talk about his thinking later in the year. But Gavin, do you want to offer any kind of quick headlines at this stage?","Gavin Hattersley","Yes. Thanks for that, Mark. Thanks, Amit. Look, I mean as Mark says, I'm going to spend the next few months leading the planning for 2020 and beyond. And as, of course, as would any CEO, there will be change. We need to consider all options that we can take to maximize the future potential of our business and to create additional firepower to put behind our brands and in order for us to innovate. And that's what I plan to do. Beyond that, I'm not going to get into any more detail.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","And Mark, congratulations on the retirement. And Gavin, congratulations to you on the new role. It's been a pleasure working with you, Mark.","Mark Hunter","Thanks a lot, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","Gavin, maybe just to follow up on Amit's question. We've seen across our coverage universe. A lot of companies have successfully sort been able to step back profit growth for the short term in order to reinvest and reaccelerate growth, right? You've seen it at Pepsi, at Mondelez, Proctor or Colgate. So I guess as you thinking about a 3-year plan, is there anything -- other than deleveraging and generating cash flow, is there anything that would constrain you as you're thinking about sort of actions that you would take to accelerate top line in terms of doing a reset in that fashion?","Gavin Hattersley","Bryan, let me kind of reiterate what I said earlier on, right, and which Mark said as well, is I'm going to take the next few months to flesh out my plan for 2020 and beyond, and I'll take the Board through that at the appropriate time. And in that, we need to consider the options that we've got that we can put enough firepower behind our brands and enable us to innovate. And of course, that will require some change and that's what I plan to do. Beyond that, Bryan, I'm not going to speculate on what that is specifically on this call.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore.","Robert Ottenstein","Great. Just a housekeeping item. Gavin, do you have a replacement lined up yet? And then second, my more substantive question -- and again, also obviously congratulations and good luck to both of you. As you kind of look forward to the Truss joint venture and the opportunity in cannabis and CBD, can you give us a sense of how big this could be for you? How excited you are about the potential? And tied to that, how much capital intensity could be involved in this if it's successful?","Gavin Hattersley","Well, perhaps you can take the second part of that question, Mark, and I'll just answer the first. Just reminding you, Robert -- and thanks again, that Mark did say when he was announced to succeed Peter as Chief Executive, we didn't initially name Mark's backfill. So it's consistent with our historical precedent and practice. As I said, I'm going to spend the next few months focusing on planning for the future. And as part of that process, I'll review the company structure and its operating model, which includes the MillerCoor's CEO role. Beyond that, I'm not going to speculate any further. Mark, do you want to take the Truss question?","Mark Hunter","Yes. Thanks, Robert. So Robert, I mean, I think we've laid out very clearly our intentions to be on the playing field here. We announced that over a year ago, and Canada gives us a great opportunity to really test consumers' appreciation for an appetite for the range of nonalcoholic cannabis-infused beverages that we'll launch. The team that set that -- set up that initiative have continued to monitor opportunities for cannabis in other geographies. We are watching very closely the opportunity in the U.S. particularly around CBDs. Now clearly there's still some legislative complications, but we anticipate being on that playing field and ideally, with our partnership, the -- with a partner that we have in Canada. And we have a team of people who are working on that. So I don't want to get into the details, but I'm giving you the same kind of, I think, indication that we gave ahead of us moving into the Canada market. So more to come on that in due course.","Operator","The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Congratulations to both of you. The first one, a quick one. I apologize if I missed it. I believe you gave an EBITDA growth guidance figure for International. Did you also provide that for other regions? And I see that you've shared some of the share figures for Coors Light and Miller Lite. Can you provide some details on what volumes did for the two of those combined?","Mark Hunter","We don't give EBITDA growth guidance beyond the MCI. We did that because we went through some very significant restructuring as we acquired the Miller International business, and we wanted to remove some of the complexity around that. That's why we gave the guidance last year and into this year, and we reiterated that guidance for strong double-digit EBITDA growth on a full year basis for our International business. ","But with regard to our major brands, again, we don't give specific volume detail. You can pick that up from the Nielsen data in the marketplace. But we're very encouraged in particular, by the Miller Lite performance. I mean just to give you an indication, in the last 4 weeks in particular, and recognizing that July 4 timing is a little bit complex, but Miller Lite in absolute terms is up single digits in absolute volume growth in the U.S. So Miller Lite has got very good momentum behind it. And we're very excited about the opportunity for Coors Light to shift its trend. And again, through July, we're seeing the Coors Light trend improve to kind of low single-digit volumes. So May and June were clearly challenging from an overall industry perspective, but it looks like normal business has been resumed as we've come through July, which is encouraging.","Operator","The next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","So I would also echo my congratulations to both of you. And Gavin, I don't want to focus too much on this topic, but I did want to clarify just one comment that you made about looking at all options and potentially increasing additional firepower, which to me sounds like maybe even some brand or asset sales on the table. So first, I just want to clarify that. And then secondly, to Tracey, just free cash flow guidance for the full year really implies a big step up in the back half of the year. I think by my math, around $300 million improvement in the back half. So can you walk us through the drivers of that improvement in the back half?","Gavin Hattersley","Judy, look, I don't want to say anything more beyond what I've already said, right? I'm not going to get into speculation now. But as I said, I'm going to spend the next few months working the plan and I would look at the company's structure and operating model, and we'll take it from there in the months ahead.","Mark Hunter","Tracey, do you want to pick up free cash flow?","Tracey Joubert","Yes. So look, the first half of this year was very soft, as we said in our earnings release and in our remarks. We certainly expect the second half performance to be better than the first half, so that's one of the drivers of the free cash flow. And in addition, we expect to see continuing working capital improvement and benefits coming out of some of the actions we are taking around working capital. And then finally, as we are paying down our debt, we have lower cash interest payment. And so those are the big drivers towards our continuing commitment to our guidance of $1.4 billion plus or minus 10% for the full year.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Stephen Powers","I guess first and foremost, thank you for your contributions, Mark, and congrats to Gavin. I'm not sure who of you will want to take this one, but I'd just love it if you could expand a bit more on something you've talked about in the past just in terms of what's changing with the hiring of Michelle on the marketing side, both in terms of how creative is being reshaped and reprioritized but also any changes in terms of how you may be sizing and reprioritizing marketing investments across different initiatives in dollar terms. I guess if you have anything to share on this front as well. I'd just love any -- if you've noticed any increased engagement with distributors as you travel around and discuss some of the new go-forward plans with them.","Mark Hunter","Okay. So Steve, let me split that into two. And I mean Gavin can talk specifically about Michelle's leadership impact in the business. And the reaction we're seeing from our distributors is the second part. On the first part, to be fair, over the course of the last, I would say, 24 to 36 months, we've been driving our Commercial Excellence approach very rigorously across our business. And that has set a very clear expectation about improved capability, more pace, more breakthrough ideas right across our organization. And I'm very encouraged by what I'm seeing across our broader marketing leadership group in Europe, International and our Canada business. Both Gavin and I were not happy with our performance with our marketing in the U.S., and that's why we made the decision in the middle of 2019 to make a change. Clearly, it took us a little bit longer than anticipated, but I would say that the wait was well worth it with Michelle's addition to the team. And Gavin, do you just want to just talk about what you've seen really since February and how you're looking at the focus on our marketing in the U.S. business unit?","Gavin Hattersley","Yes, Mark, thanks. And thanks, Steve. Look, I mean there's a number of things I can say. Firstly, I think you can see an increased pace with how we are doing our marketing. You're going to see us target investment behind brands and ideas where we see the greatest returns, particularly in a world where consumer retention is in all-time high, and we need to have the right ideas. And when we have them, we'll put money behind them. ","And a fine example of that is the work that we've done on one of our newer brand launches, which is Cape Line, and we've grown our innovation pipeline quite heavily to attract these new consumers. We are shifting a greater percentage of our investment to the above premium segment with big increases on brands, such as Blue Moon and Peroni. And we're going to continue to invest strongly in Coors Light and Miller Lite. And I'm very excited about our new Coors Light creative, and we have very strong messaging behind Miller Lite. Michelle has also continued to shift spend to digital and nontraditional media to reach those groups of consumers who now spend their time away from more traditional channels. ","As far as Coors Light is concerned specifically, gained a little bit of share of segment in Q2 of 2019, which is the first time we've done that for quite some time. And obviously, we're not where we want to be at this point in time. We know that focusing back on cold refreshment was the right thing to do, and shifting that message to cold refreshment has improved trends, but it's obviously not enough. And Michelle has worked and moved very quickly to launch this big, new campaign. It feels very distinctive. It feels fresh, and it's unlike anything else you've seen in beer. I hope you've all had a chance to see it. ","The \"Made to Chill\" platform focus on the language which resonates with young people, and it builds on occasions that we believe is only going to grow into the future. It launched yesterday and, quite frankly, I don't know that I've experienced this much excitement from the distributor network since 2005 around this. But you note, it's day 3, and we're -- whilst we're excited about it, now we need to execute against it. But the level of excitement I've felt was -- is very strong.","So to summarize, we're changing where we're marketing. We're changing who we're marketing to, and we're changing the pace at which we're getting things done. And I think if you talk to our distributor network, they will concur with that as far as marketing is concerned.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Gavin. Steve, just to kind of put a full stop on this. I mean if you look across our business and look at the range and pace of initiatives that we now have in marketplace, it stepped up dramatically in the last 24 months, and I've covered many of them in the script. But if you just look within the U.S. and take Cape Line, Arnold Palmer Spiked, Henry's Hard Sparkling and the Sol family of brands, just over 24 months ago, none of those existed in our portfolio. By the end of this year, they will be millions and millions of cases of volume. So take that as, I think, indicative of what has been emerging and what will continue to emerge in our business as we further ramp up with innovation and the pace of premiumization right across all of our business units.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","And congrats and best of luck to both of you, Mark and Gavin, in this new chapter. So my main question is on the U.S. volume trends. So I was hoping to get more details on Tracey's comments about the timing of STRs and STWs. So if you're effectively calling for about mid-single-digit decline in the third quarter, because obviously, you had a bigger shipment decline in the second? And can you also let us know if the go live in the two other plants that you're planning in the third quarter and the back hand of the year could impact the shipment in the quarters?","Mark Hunter","Okay. So Tracey, do you want to just kind of reiterate the comments you made through the script? Then Gavin, if there's any additional detail on the back of that?","Tracey Joubert","Yes. So at a high level, we are expecting our STRs and STWs to really converge on a full year basis. And then the comments around Q3 and Q4, so if you remember we had a very strong STW quarter in Q3 of last year. And as we ramped up the inventory for our go live at our Trenton Brewery and our Fort Worth brewery, and that resulted in very hard days of inventory at the end of September, which then lead to a very soft shipment quarter in Q4 of last year as the inventory level came down. ","And then this year, we do have two remaining go lives in Albany and Irwindale. But the bulk will be limited to distributors only within those brewery orbits. So it's not really as widespread across our distributor network as the Trenton and Fort Worth breweries were. So Gavin, I don't know if you want to add to that?","Gavin Hattersley","No, Tracey. That was perfect.","Operator","The next question comes from Sean King with UBS.","Sean King","I guess with respect to the MG&A increase, how much of that was brand building spend? And should we expect the 2Q pace of MD&A growth to continue in the back half? And I guess any -- was any of that brand building spend weighted to Q2 for campaigns that go live into Q3?","Mark Hunter","Yes. So we don't break out our specific marketing spend, Sean, but I think I indicated in our Q1 call that we expected to step up particularly in Q2 and Q3 the weight of our spend because they are the critical 2 quarters in the year. So we've delivered on that promise in the second quarter. And we anticipate that continuing to step up our spend in the third quarter of this year. And confidence is growing in terms of the quality of the work that we have and the premiumization of the portfolio. So expect those to continue to really deliver on the commitments we've made, and you should see that as you've seen in the second quarter and the third quarter as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.","Laurent Grandet","And Mark, I wish you all the best for your next chapter. And Gavin, congrats on the new role. My question is about Europe. So first, it was the U.S. then the U.S. and Canada and now Europe is even down. So I appreciate the World Cup did impact negatively this year numbers but assuming, let's say, I mean 200 to 300 basis points of impact. And correct me if I'm wrong, this still leave us with about 3% volume drop in Europe. So could you please give us more color here? And how we should think about Europe going forward? And also, I mean, how do you see the recent change of Premier League sponsorship away from Carling to Budweiser impacting your commercialization in the U.K.?","Mark Hunter","So let me ask Simon to pick up. Simon's traveling internationally at the moment, but I think he's on the line. So if this works then, Simon, do you want to pick up that question?","Simon Cox","Yes, Mark. Thank you very much. Although we've been on a consistent run for a while now in Europe in terms of our growth. And we've tried to do that through a balance of gender, of volume, pricing and mix. That hasn't worked this quarter because ultimately, the volume line has been disappointing. I think we'd be the first to admit that. But the volume line is really fully impacted by wet and cold weather in May and June versus actually very dry and warm weather this time last year. And as you said, we also had the World Cup to lap. If you look at our pricing and our mix component, it remains consistently good as we've had for many quarters now. So all of the top line miss is very much driven by volume, and the volume is very, very heavily impacted by the weather, which is actually a much bigger driver in our estimation than the World Cup lapping. So I actually remain very, very confident that our underlying momentum is very much in line with our previous quarters. And that this quarter was an aberration due to what was effectively market demand. ","And I would also point to the fact that we haven't changed our share trajectory. So if you look at our last few courses of growth, they've been consistent. They've been driven by a mix of volume and price and mix whereas in this quarter, we have just seen some very, very soft volumes. So I remain confident that the underlying strategy is working, the investment behind our brand is working. Our premiumization agenda is working very nicely, as evidenced by the mix. ","And to turn to your question about the future. If volume demand comes back into more normal and throughout our group of markets, that is a sort of flattish market outlook, then I will be very confident that we will continue to post those net sales revenue growth trends. And in July, it looks like the market will be back to its normal sort of overall performance. And in July, we will continue to grow our revenues. ","So in summary, I would regard it as an aberration, and I think we'll get back on track for the balance of the year, providing that the market volume stabilize, and there's every reason to believe they will.","Mark Hunter","And Simon, any comments around the Premier League reshuffle, second part of his question?","Simon Cox","Yes, sorry. Realized that was a two-part question. Yes, look, the Premier League sponsorship worked very well for us. We are very highly associated with football with Carling, but we made the decision to come out of that and reinvest behind a broader-based Carling marketing campaign, which we think actually will have even more appeal. So of course, we have to transition plan and plan that carefully. And Carling's been taking share in the mainstream lager segment for a long time now over a sustained period. We are very keen and determined that we continue to do so. And we've launched a new marketing campaign this year, which is early days, but I can be confident that we can transition to the more broad appeal rather than just a football-based appeal.","Operator","The next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.","Vivien Azer","And my congratulations to you both. So Gavin, this is something we've discussed off and on over the years, but as I look at longer-term U.S. beer industry volume trends, I fully appreciate the commentary about bad weather in May and June. And I heard you guys that July is more normalized. But if I look at the data that your largest competitor offers for the U.S. industry, it looks like 2015, down 30 basis points, than down 100 basis points, than 130 basis points, then 180 basis points. And it seems to me that there is some vigorous structural challenge in the industry. And so what I want to hear from you is that as you think about kind of establishing this next 3-year plan, are you assuming that this industry is steady state. Or is it better to assume that there's going to continue to be more structural degradation for the beer category? And any other thoughts just around the health of the category and how you can operate against that backdrop would be helpful.","Gavin Hattersley","Well, thanks, Vivien. Look, I mean I think it's safe to say that competition for consumers' attention is really at a high level in the United States. And obviously, the beer category, the beer industry needs to evolve quickly. And it needs to keep pace with consumer preferences, which are rapidly changing. I would point to the seltzers, alcoholic seltzers is a more recent example of that. A large part of seltzer's growth is coming from outside of the beer category, specifically wine and spirits. And so for us, that means that we need to keep focused on that evolving space. And as was said, it means two things for us: It means a much faster-paced innovation pipeline. And it means recruiting and focusing on drinkers, new drinkers with our core brands.","And so you'll see our plan, both here in the United States and globally, embracing these new categories and focusing in on the above premium. And as Mark said, we've been very successful with Arnold Palmer Spiked and Henry's and Cape Line, all of which will be delivering millions of cases to the beer category by the end of the year from outside of the beer industry. ","So I think innovation is essential. Above premium is essential. And catering to consumers' different needs is essential. And we're going to focus on all of those as we go forward.","Mark Hunter","Vivien, it's Mark here. I mean the only thing I would add to that is just making sure that we continue to keep the balance and focus between both volume and the -- really the value growth of the U.S. beer industry. Consumers are clearly changing taste, and most of the demand in the marketplace is emerging in higher-priced above premium space. So actually, the total revenue for beer in the U.S. has continued to grow despite some of the volume challenges, and that's why it's important for the Molson Coors business, across all of our business units, but particularly in the U.S. to accelerate the pace of premiumization and why you've seen -- and what you have seen emerge and why you'll see more of that going forward as we look to reshape our portfolio. So stabilizing and energizing our core brands by accelerating the pace of premiumization. And that is our agenda. That's an agenda which is on the tracks, and I know that Gavin will look to accelerate that over the coming months and years ahead.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","I was going to stick with the topic of spiked seltzer, but also more broadly on innovation and disruptive thinking. Some of these topics have been touched on earlier. But specifically with spiked seltzer, how do you plan to complete in the category? It's obviously growing rapidly, albeit with little product differentiation. What's sort of the strategy there? And how are we defining success at this point? Or how is the company defining success? ","And then more broadly -- and Gavin, maybe you can pick up on this as you sort of assume leadership here of the company. What do you think the company needs to do better as an organization to become faster and more in tune with changing consumer taste when you look at the companies and the brands that are leading in seltzer right now, as an example, much smaller than Molson Coors? So what do you think needs to be done here so that the company can become quicker and more responsive to changing consumer taste?","Mark Hunter","Okay. Thanks, Kevin. Do you want to pick those up, Gavin? They're kind of opposite sides of the same coin.","Gavin Hattersley","Yes. Sure, Mark. Thanks. Look, I mean there's no doubt, Kevin, that seltzers are big, and they're here to stay. And we think that the reason for that though is they're tapped into two big consumer trends which have evolved. One is better for you trends, and the other is consumers looking for an alternative taste for beer. And whilst Henry's is performing well, I mean, it's growing at triple digits, it's off a small base. And therefore, we bought a deep innovation funnel that we're looking at. Some of this focus is on consumer white spaces against those consumer trends, and Cape Line would be a fine example of that. It's the first better-for-you option with a stronger flavor base. And from Cape Line point of view, I'd like to point out that same stage as the evolution of White Claw. And truly, several years ago, Cape Line is actually performing meaningfully better than those two brands who were at the same stage. Again, it's only -- we've only had it in for a few months, but the early signs are very good. ","And on top of that, we need to more squarely go after the seltzer space with new and unique points of differences in the marketplace. And obviously, for competitive reasons, I'm not going to get into exactly what we plan to do from that aspect, but watch this space. ","As far as the innovation pipeline is concerned, I think you used the right word, right, which is pace and speed, and I think everything that we've done over the last 4 or 5 months since our marketing leadership change has demonstrated that we can do that. We're capable of doing it, and we are doing it. And there's multiple examples, which we talked about in the past. We also have with 2 of -- I mean, we've had the #1 new FMB in both 2018 and 2019 with Arnold Palmer Spiked and this year in Cape Line. We're moving quicker. We're taking smarter risks, and you're quite right. In this fast-changing environment, we can't afford to let others pass us by. So I think you will see us move with pace going forward. And from competitive point of view, I'm not going to get into specifics of that other than what we've public, which is Movo, which is line of wine spritzers, hard coffee beverages and our test market on Saint Archer Gold, which has shown great potential in its 4 test markets.","Mark Hunter","And I mean just to add to that, Gavin and Kevin, if you look more broadly, I mean Coors Slice is the #1 new item across major retailers in Canada this year. Pravha has been a remarkable success in the U.K. marketplace. So I think there's demonstration in terms of what we've already taken to market and what's in our pipeline. The organization is already, let's call it, through integration and well on track for picking up the pace and driving a significant step change in the number of initiatives that we have from an innovation and premiumization perspective across all of our business units. And you'll see more of that to come.","Operator","Your next question is from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","First off, Mark and Gavin, congrats to you both. Tracey, just as we think about your leverage trajectory, should we still be thinking about 3.75x on a net basis by year-end? And where should that ultimately settle out sort of in 2020 and '21? And then specific to getting to the year-end target, given the cadence of your debt maturities, should we just expect your cash to build on the balance sheet? Or would you look for incremental debt paydown opportunities given that you don't have anything maturing over the rest of the year?","Tracey Joubert","Yes. So just in terms of the optimal leverage ratio, we haven't given that. I mean the -- our focus is maintaining our investment-grade rating. And then in terms of what we're expecting for the end of this year, so we expect to be below 4x by year-end. And we will continue to focus on deleverage into the future within our capital allocation strategy. At this point, we are not looking to pay down any additional debt beyond what our debt program is. So there's no sort of pre-payable that we will be making. But that would mean that towards the end of the year, we probably will have a higher level of cash on our balance sheet getting ready for the next debt that we need to pay down.","Operator","The next question is a follow-up from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets.","Amit Sharma","Gavin, just a quick question on pricing in the U.S. We already talked about or confirmed pricing in April. Can you talk about how you view that? Is there any plan to maybe take advantage of that to push through another off-cycle pricing for you guys?","Gavin Hattersley","Nice try, Amit. I'm not going to give forward pricing guidance. I can talk about what happened in the second quarter, which is that we grew net sales per hectoliter 3.6%, with frontline of 3.9% and brand mix -- not brand mix, total mix was negative by about 30 basis points. But our brand mix was actually positive for the quarter. And that is reflective of our premium efforts. Beyond that, Amit, I'm not going to get into future pricing strategy. I can't do that.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Hunter for any closing remarks.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everybody, for joining us. Today, obviously, we had some unexpected news for you, which we've chatted though, and Gavin and I will forward to catching up with you over the course of the next couple of months. ","Just as a sign off from me, as I mentioned earlier, it's been absolute privilege to serve as the Molson Coors CEO, and I've thoroughly enjoyed engaging with our investors and our analysts over the course of the last 5 years. I will see many of you up in Boston, and you're likely to ask me questions as well as Gavin questions when we get together in a month or so time.

Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thank you, Alison, and hello and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call and thanks for joining us today. With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have Tracey Joubert, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, the CEO of our U.S. business; Fred Landtmeters, our Canada CEO; Simon Cox, the CEO of our Europe business; Sergey Yeskov, our International CEO; Lee Reichert, our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Global VP of Investor Relations.","Today, Tracey and I will take you through our plans to drive long-term total shareholder returns, highlighting our first quarter results and also discuss our outlook for the business. Along with this, we are offering related slides on the Investor Relations page of our website.","As context to our 2018 first quarter results, we finished 2017 as the first full year of a new, larger Molson Coors, with solid financial and commercial performance and excellent progress on integration and synergy-driven cost savings.","Our First Choice approach to strengthen and premiumize our portfolio, build strong customer relationships and deliver meaningful profit contribution from our international business, while driving capability, productivity and sustainable cost savings, remains our strategy. And this is underpinned by our absolute and primary focus on cash generation, deleverage, margin expansion and delivering total shareholder returns.","In Q1, which is seasonally the smallest profit quarter of the year for us, our Canadian, European and","International businesses maintained their underlying progress from 2017.","The U.S. beer industry had, as you are aware, a softer-than-anticipated start to the year, which has impacted both top and bottom line performance and which, when coupled with the U.S. distributor inventory destocking and the anticipated cycling of the indirect tax provision benefit in Europe from last year, led to an underlying EBITDA reduction of 18.5% for our company in the first quarter. We do not see these results as indicative of our full-year performance versus our plan and we remain committed to delivering our 2018 guidance.","Now, looking more closely at Q1, there are three specific negative performance drivers, one of which is already behind us and another which we expect to fully reverse by the year-end. The first relates to cycling the reversal of the indirect tax provision benefit in Europe, which negatively impacted net sales and pre-tax income by approximately $50 million and is now behind us.","The second relates to reduction in U.S. STWs, which declined by 6.7%, as we under-shipped versus last year. U.S. distributor inventory levels were lower than planned, compounded by the rollout of our new ordering system at the Golden brewery, which has taken longer to ramp up than expected.","Compared to last year, we under-shipped by approximately 450,000 hectoliters, which represent approximately $30 million of gross profit and we expect this to reverse on a full-year basis, with the negative first quarter profit impact reversing primarily in the second half of this year.","The third performance driver relates to overall industry softness with our U.S. brand volume or STRs down by 3.8%, as poor weather dampened overall industry demand. Our market share trends, however, remained consistent with 2017.","Against this backdrop of year-over-year headwinds, we continued to drive positive global pricing and improved first quarter EBITDA in Canada, International and Europe, excluding the impact of the indirect tax provision benefit from last year. We expect the International business to contribute meaningfully to the bottom line in 2018 as we anticipate full-year EBITDA delivery of $20 million to $25 million.","In the U.S., the suite of consumer and customer activity that is just reaching the market has been very positively received by our distributor network and we're very encouraged by the early reaction to the portfolio additions, such as Sol and Arnold Palmer.","Now, we will continue to drive premiumization of our portfolio and our above-premium brands accounted for 19% of our portfolio, consistent with 2017. Despite strong growth from many of our above-premium brands, volume declined by 4% as we reduced promotional intensity in Mexico on Coors Light and saw softer volumes in the U.S. in our flavored malt beverages. Continued premiumization of the portfolio and strengthening our mainstream brands remains central to our approach, as evidenced by the performance within Europe and Canada.","Now, let me turn the call to Tracey to give more detail on the first quarter.","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. Our 2018 bottom line focus includes delivering strong free cash flow, generating cost savings and strengthening our balance sheet via debt paydown. While our earnings release provides more details, I want to spend a moment to share the following specifics for 2018.","We are reiterating our underlying free cash flow guidance of $1.5 billion, plus or minus 10%. Cost savings guidance remains $210 million in 2018 and is part of our three-year target of $600 million. Recent input cost increases make these savings initiatives particularly important this year.","Also, while our COGS per hectoliter guidance remains unchanged for the year in the U.S., Canada and","Europe, we are seeing added pressure from significant spikes in the cost of a few key inputs. These include aluminum and the particularly volatile Midwest premium storage cost, along with higher freight and fuel.","We have hedging programs in place, which provide partial protection from these increases. Last quarter, we quantified 2018 inflation headwinds of more than $110 million. In the current volatile cost environment, our teams are working to mitigate the impact of these increases.","Now, let's review our consolidated financial headlines for the first quarter versus a year ago.","As highlighted in our earnings release, U.S. GAAP net income increased 33.4% as a result of a $328 million cash payment received in January 2018 related to a purchase-price adjustment to our acquisition of the Miller International business, along with positive global net pricing, cost savings and lower interest expenses.","These factors were partially offset by unrealized mark-to-market losses on our commodity positions versus gains a year ago, lower financial volume, the impact of cycling the indirect tax provision benefit and higher input cost inflation.","Underlying EBITDA decreased 18.5% on a reported basis and 19.7% on a constant currency basis, driven by lower financial volume, the impact of cycling the indirect tax provision benefit, global mix and higher input cost inflation, partially offset by positive global net pricing and cost savings.","Net sales decreased 4.8% due to lower financial and royalty volumes, negative global mix, adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard and the approximate $50 million impact of cycling the indirect tax provision benefit in Europe. This was partially offset by positive global pricing and foreign currency movements. Net sales in constant currency declined 7.2%.","Net sales per hectoliter, which is now presented on a brand-volume basis, decreased 2.6% in constant currency, driven by cycling the indirect tax provision reversal, adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard and geographic sales mix, partially offset by positive global pricing. On a reported financial-volume basis, NSR per hectoliter increased 0.1%.","Worldwide brand volume decreased 3.1%, driven by the U.S., Canada and International declines. Global priority brand volume decreased 5.6% and financial volume decreased 4.9% and was adversely impacted by reductions in brand volumes, wholesale inventories and contract brewing. Coors Light brand volume declined in the U.S., Canada and International, but continued to grow in Europe.","And now, I'd like to share some regional highlights. In the U.S., underlying EBITDA decreased 12.2% versus last year, driven by lower STW volumes, negative sales mix, volume deleverage and COGS inflation, partially offset by higher net pricing, cost savings and lower MG&A expenses.","Net sales per hectoliter increased 1.1% in the quarter. Excluding the effect of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, NSR per hectoliter would have increased 1.4%.","As Mark highlighted earlier, two factors negatively impacted our U.S. business this quarter. First, our domestic sales to wholesalers declined 6.7% and reflected lower-than-planned distributor inventory levels, which negatively impacted gross profit by approximately $30 million and was compounded by the launch of our new ordering system at the Golden brewery that took longer to ramp up than anticipated. We expect this inventory impact to reverse on a full-year basis, with the negative first quarter profit impact reversing in the second half of this year.","Secondly, the overall industry softness was reflected in our U.S. brand volume decline of 3.8%.","Despite the inventory and industry backdrop, our market share trend was consistent with last year. We continued to gain share in Premium Light, as Miller Lite gained segment share for the 14th consecutive quarter, while Coors Light slightly underperformed the segment.","We gained share of segment and industry with our below-premium portfolio, while our above-premium share loss was driven by declines in the increasingly competitive flavored malt beverages category. Premiumization of the portfolio did benefit from continued growth from our regional craft brands during the quarter and we are excited about activation for Blue Moon, Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy and our portfolio innovations as we approach peak selling season.","Our Canada underlying EBITDA increased 2.5% in the first quarter on a reported basis, driven by positive sales mix and foreign currency movements, partially offset by lower brand volume and net pricing. Canada underlying EBITDA on a constant currency basis declined 0.5%, showing continued improvement compared to previous quarters.","Net sales per hectoliter declined 2.9% in constant currency during the quarter as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. Excluding the effect of the new accounting standard, NSR per hectoliter would have increased 1.1% due to positive brand mix and this reflects our continued strategy to premiumize our portfolio.","Brand volumes decreased 3.3% in the backdrop of a weak industry in western Canada during the quarter, and high inventory levels in Qu\u00e9bec at the start of the year as we concluded union contract negotiations. While Coors Light and Molson Canadian volumes are still the majority of the decline, we continue to stay focused on improving our share trends in the premium segment.","In Europe, our underlying EBITDA declined by 65.2% in the first quarter on a reported basis and 68.5% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to cycling the indirect tax benefit in 2017. NSR per hectoliter declined 18.3% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to cycling the indirect tax provision benefit and adopting recently revised excise-tax guidelines.","During the quarter, we gained market share in Europe, driven by strong performance from Coors Light, craft and many of our national champion brands. While Staropramen was down due to weak Czech Republic on-premise channel, we continued to premiumize the portfolio with growth from Staropramen outside its home market.","Top and bottom line results were also impacted by the increased investment we made in our First Choice Agenda during 2018. In addition, we have chosen to adopt recently revised industry guidelines for calculating excise tax payments in one of our markets, which reduced our Europe NSR per hectoliter by low-single digits. This was partially offset on the bottom line by the benefit of cycling an $11 million bad debt provision in Croatia last year.","Brand volume growth was achieved despite unfavorable March weather in many of our Central European markets this year. During the quarter, our U.K. team also successfully integrated the Aspall Cider business that we acquired in January.","For our International business, underlying EBITDA improved by $2.1 million from last year, driven by lower MG&A costs, including a settlement related to our Colombia business, along with higher net pricing. These factors were partially offset by the loss of the Modelo brands in Japan.","Net sales per hectoliter declined 0.5% in constant currency, driven by unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by positive pricing. We achieved organic volume growth in many of our focus markets. However, total brand volume decreased 7.1% in the quarter, driven by the loss of the Modelo contract in Japan.","Volumes were also negatively impacted by Mexico as we reduced promotional intensity to better balance volume and price and drive for higher bottom line performance in this large beer market.","As Mark mentioned earlier, strong Q1 performance and our full-year plans give us confidence in generating $20 million to $25 million of underlying EBITDA in our International business this year.","As a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and pension accounting guidance, we have provided incremental details in our earnings release and 10-Q, which our investor community may find helpful when modeling out our business.","Looking forward, we will ensure that our business generates strong cash flow, as we strengthen our balance sheet and deliver cost savings, while increasing our EBITDA margins over the next three to four years. And, finally, as many of you have anticipated, we plan to discuss our capital allocation priorities in more detail during our Annual Investor Day in New York in June.","At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Tracey. I began this call by outlining our plans to drive total shareholder returns. And going forward, we believe our ambition to be First Choice for our consumers and customers will be central to both our bottom and top line success.","Our regional business priorities are clear and consistent. In the U.S., we plan to rebuild distributor inventories in the second half, as we are continuing to drive our portfolio strategy of building distinctive brands across all segments to meet the needs of all American beer drinkers. We'll continue to gain segment share in premium, grow volume in above-premium and continue to stabilize our below-premium brand volume and share.","We gained share in Premium Lights, led by Miller Lite. And this brand will have even bolder messaging to further assert its positioning as the original light beer that doesn't compromise on taste. We believe the new Coors Light creative and refreshed packaging will improve the recent trend declines, as the brand will reinforce its role as the World's Most Refreshing Beer, including the summer collaboration with YETI, a premium outdoor brand.","We have more work to do in the above-premium segment, but we are seeing strong demand for Blue Moon Mango Wheat and Blue Moon variety packs as well as the recently released 15 packs and 24-ounce cans of Blue Moon Belgian White. We'll also look to build on last year's record-setting performance from Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy and compete more assertively within the strongly growing hard seltzers segment with Henry's Hard Sparkling, which is now available in the slim can package.","The geographic footprint of our regional craft brands will continue to expand and we expect Terrapin, Hop Valley, Revolver and Saint Archer, collectively, to continue to far outpace the craft segment.","In below-premium, we continue to grow share of both segment and industry with our brands, led by the Keystone family.","Our 2018 U.S. innovation line-up is off to a strong start. The Sol brand was re-launched in April with redesigned packaging, supported by an integrated marketing campaign that will be prominently featured throughout the summer, especially during the FIFA World Cup. Early results are very promising.","Arnold Palmer Spiked Half & Half distribution is ramping up and will be supported through an expansive media campaign and suite of retail tools. And lastly, retro favorite and 2017 success, Zima will be available for a limited time starting on Memorial Day.","Despite the recent headwinds we have been facing, we believe we have the brands, plans and people to drive increases in profit and free cash flow and ultimately to reach our goal of volume growth.","In Canada, the team continues to focus on executing our strategy to strengthen our business. Our consumer excellence teams will continue to focus on evolving the shape of our brand portfolio, with the objective to stabilize our premium brand performance, accelerate the growth of our above-premium portfolio and simplify our offering in the economy segment.","In below-premium, we've seen the recently launched Miller High Life brand delivering strong early results and perfectly complementing our Pilsner and Black Label brands, as all three brands enjoyed growth in the first quarter.","In the premium segment, we'll see increased brand activity starting in the second quarter. While we approach the end of the hockey and basketball season, we have already shifted gears to baseball, which sees Coors Light starting its first season as the beer sponsor of the Major League Baseball in Canada.","As consumer preference for above-premium brands continues to increase, we'll keep driving an acceleration of the growth of our key import brand, Heineken, as well as our owned MGD and Coors Banquet brands. Trou du Diable, our most recent addition to our craft beer portfolio, is broadening our footprint in the world of craft in Qu\u00e9bec and delivering strong early results.","In terms of above-premium innovations, we have lifted and shifted two MillerCoors brands, Leinenkugel's Shandy and Henry's Hard Soda, in March into the Canadian market. Also, we will soon add Coors Edge, a new non-alcoholic product introduction complementing our current 0.0 offering in this rapidly growing segment, that's from Heineken 0.0.","Finally, as we look to ongoing productivity improvements, the build-out of our new highly efficient brewery in B.C. is on track for brewing in the next year and planning for our new brewery in Qu\u00e9bec is advancing quickly.","In Europe, we'll continue to use a balanced portfolio approach, disciplined retail execution and optimization of our brewery network and infrastructure. The impact of the recently revised excise-tax guidelines and the increased investment in strengthening our First Choice Agenda will continue through the balance of 2018, as we seek to grow top and bottom line sustainably.","When modeling the results of Europe, we currently anticipate a low-single-digit impact per quarter to NSR per hectoliter for the remainder of the year and it's also important to note the changes in pension accounting this year that are outlined in our earnings release.","Our commercial teams will build on our positive momentum by further strengthening our national champion brands, including Carling, our largest brand in Europe. As we approach peak beer and cider selling season, we are also excited about the potential we see for the Aspall business, which provides another above-premium cider brand as we further premiumize our U.K. portfolio.","Our balanced portfolio approach also relies on continuing commitment to maintain and improve our customer relationships as we continue to drive our First Choice Agenda.","In 2017, our International business broke through to EBITDA profitability as we expanded our geographic footprint and added significant brand scale and we expect significant additional bottom line progress in","2018 as mentioned earlier. This business will continue to utilize an asset-light model in select markets, and our efforts will focus on Coors Light, MGD and Miller Lite.","Our growth strategy includes several high-potential markets and success in these markets will play a pivotal role in reaching our long-term top and bottom line international growth targets.","Across Molson Coors, our teams are focused on our first priority, which is to drive margin expansion, bottom line growth and strong free cash flow to enable deleverage. Our second priority remains to deliver an improved top line through our First Choice commercial excellence approach, which provides the most sustainable source of profit growth over the medium to long term.","Capital allocation within our business continues to be guided by our Profit after Capital Charge or PACC approach, as we seek to deliver total shareholder returns. Our regional business plans are clear and consistent with these priorities and we remain committed to delivering our full-year 2018 plans.","Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment, as usual, our prepared remarks and slides will be on our website for your reference later this afternoon. Dave Dunnewald and Kevin Kim will be available via telephone or email to assist with any additional questions you may have regarding our quarterly results.","And additionally, in the next two months, we hope to see many of you at two events. Firstly, we'll hold our Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Wednesday, May 23, 2018, in Denver, and secondly, we'll host our Annual New York Investor\/Analyst Day at the New York Stock Exchange on the afternoon of Wednesday, June 6 of this year.","So, at this point, Alison, we'd like to open up for questions, please. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Good morning, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. I've got a question, I guess, related to, in the U.S., the gap between sales to wholesalers and sales to retailers and I guess there's kind of two parts to it. One is, I guess, as you had shipment issues out of the Golden brewery, has that at all affected service levels and affected sort of consumption at all, so there've been added stocks or any effect sort of in the commercial aspect of it?","And then, the second, again, related to this gap is, has there been any retail inventory destocking? And I asked in the context of some large retailers have begun to kind of clean up inventory in the back room. And so, just curious to the extent that that's affected your businesses and, if it has, will that sort to be a permanent reduction in retail export? Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hey. Thanks, Bryan. Let me just give you a headline and then, Gavin, if you want to pick up the specific. I mean, I think the important thing is if you take a half step back here and just look at our market share performance, so really look at the demand in the marketplace at consumer level, our market share performance has remained very consistent from a trend perspective. So, I think, at a higher level, you can see that it hasn't really had an impact on our underlying market competitiveness. But, clearly, behind that, there are always puts and takes.","So, Gavin, do you want to talk just a little bit about some of the puts and takes on STWs versus STRs?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Mark. Good morning, Bryan. Look, I mean, it's clear that we have had some out of stocks because of the Golden brewery rollout of our new system. It's been relatively more significant in our Central and Pacific Northwest regions and, to a limited degree, in the Great Lakes, while the rest of the country wasn't impacted.","From a retail point of view, Bryan, I would say no. I mean, the retailers have, for some time, been taking SKUs levels down. That has actually resulted in increased velocity for some of our faster-moving SKUs. So, I would say no to the second part of your question.","And if you look more broadly at STRs and STWs with STWs being down about 6.7%, if you took into account the change in the inventory levels and the impact on shipments, our trend would be much closer to the STR level of down 3.8%.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Gavin.","Operator","Our next question will come from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you very much. Could you give us a little bit more color on your 1.4% increase in revenue per hectoliter in the U.S., which was pretty strong? But you noted that mix was negative. So, how much was price up and what were the drivers on the negative mix? Just a little bit more understanding of that number, please.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hi, Robert. Sure. So, again, I'll ask Gavin to talk to that. I mean, I think, just to add to your question, one of the important things to recognize is if you look right across our business, we've seen strong focus and strong development of our NSR per hectoliter performance. And I think that's testament just to the way that we're really driving our pricing and revenue management capability in our business.","But if you want to dive a bit deeper into the U.S., Gav, do you want to just talk about the relative price mix combination?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Sure, Mark. On a comparable basis, Robert, and that excludes the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting guidance, our domestic net sales per hectoliter grew 1.4%. Sales mix was negative by about 90 basis points. That implies growth of 2.3% against net price components. That net price portion does include a benefit from our portion of the federal excise tax law change that reduced it to $16 a barrel for the first 6 million barrels. So, that's in these numbers. And remember, we did pass along 30% of our saving across to our distributors in terms of our economic model. And that would probably about 50 basis points.","Our negative sales mix was primarily driven by package mix and it was led by the success of the Keystone 15 packs. Our economy strategies are working really well as you can see by the growth in Keystone, Hamm's and Steel Reserve Alloy Series and, of course, we like the success of our economy strategy, but unfortunately it has a negative impact on mix, which did offset the strong growth of Peroni and Crispin and other regional crafts.","Going forward, we're going to stay highly focused on increasing our share of above-premium. We got lots of opportunity to do that, Robert. In Q2, we will ramp up our efforts on Sol and Arnold Palmer Spiked as Mark said in his opening remarks. And we're going to build on Leinie's Summer Shandy volume.","Our regional craft companies are going to drive positive mix and so will Blue Moon as we come out of our supply challenges that we've experienced together with the introduction of that new 15 pack and the 24-ounce singles. And we are going to increase our media pressure behind the brand.","From a mix point of view, Redd's remains a challenge and we're going to continue to optimize our flavor profiles and with Redd's Wicked, we're going to increase our spend behind that brand. So, given all these efforts, we would expect our mix to improve over the balance of the year.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Thanks, Gavin.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just I wanted to, Mark and Gavin, just to clarify, I mean the 3.8% that you've alluded to on the release was the STRs, I understand. So, in the balance of the year, what do you think those STRs will likely migrate to in the context of your guidance, what you can control in terms of how you're seeing the balance of the quarter? And if you can give us any sort of quarter to-date approximate number, that will be helpful. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hey, Andrea. It's Mark here. We don't give that level of guidance either within quarter or on a full-year basis in relation to our volumes. And I think, again, if you take a step back, our market share performance remained consistent in the first quarter with what we've seen over the course of the last number of quarters.","I think Gavin and I's view would be that we expect the U.S. industry to be more in line with, I would say, the historical medium-term trends. So, that's how we are planning our business as we look through the balance of this year. So, we don't give specific STR guidance.","Operator","Our next question will come from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks. Good morning.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hey, Stephen.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, you guys in the category are obviously off to a tough start, but you've maintained the full-year outlook despite what I'm hearing as incremental headwinds in aluminum and international COGS and freight and fuel. So, I guess what I'm trying to get underneath is what gets better as the year progresses, as you sequence away from Q1. It doesn't look like you're pulling forward any savings from the future or funding new savings. So, again, I'm struggling for where the offset is in your outlook.","And perhaps as you're answering that, you could talk about what you're expecting shipment trends to look like for the remainder of the year and just how clear your visibility is really in the context of Golden that the U.S. sales, the wholesalers will fully correct as the year progresses. Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Stephen, let me try and kind of break that down for you. So, to take your last point first, I think we've been consistent. We always try and ship to consumption. So, we expect the relationship between our STWs and our STRs to be in balance by the year-end. So, the imbalance you've seen in the first quarter, we expect to reverse both from a volume and a gross margin perspective through the second half of this year.","I think if you then come and look at our total performance, the one thing to bear in mind is that if you look through 2015, 2016 and 2017 on a full-year basis, we've always delivered on our full-year commitments and even when we've had some volatile quarters. So, Q1 of this year is a little bit unusual. There's a couple of big events in there which are unusual and that's why we believe we are still committed to our guidance for this year. If you look historically, the first quarter is only about 14% or 15% of our total profit. So, we've still got the majority of the year ahead of us from a profit delivery perspective.","And we've talked again very consistently about the fact that we've retained flexibility in our P&L to deal with either opportunities or headwinds emerge. And we've done that, I think, very successfully over the course of the last two or three years. So, big picture, we've consistently delivered on our full-year performance. We remain committed to our guidance and our full-year plans for this year and we've got the majority of our profits still to deliver through Q2 to Q4. So, that's probably the best context I can give you.","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","And, Mark, if I could just add there as well and, Stephen, just to talk a little bit about the COGS side, so we do have a very robust hedging program. We're not fully hedged, but that does provide partial protection to our COGS line. And then, as Mark has mentioned around flexibility in our P&L, there are levers that we can pull and we've shown that in the past that we can do that in order to protect our bottom line and deliver on our medium-term guidance as well as our guidance for 2018.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Thanks, Tracey. Thanks, Stephen, for the question.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. So, just to follow up on Steve's question, I'm just wondering \u2013 I know you won't give us a specific number, but have your expectations changed on the U.S. volume front in terms of your delivery of that full-year guidance?","And then, the real question is you basically highlighted that weather drove a lot of the U.S. industry softness in the quarter. Presumably, there are other factors also. So, just wanted to get your view around the industry softness? How much of that is temporary? Are you expecting a recovery in the balance of the year? How are you guys thinking about that?","And then, I guess last, given the volume softness, any changes in plans for the way you manage the business in the remainder of the year, either on the pricing front or in terms of marketing investment behind the business? Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Dara, it's Mark here. So, let me again try and break that down for you. From our U.S. industry guidance perspective, it's really as per my previous comments, which we expect the balance of the year to be more in line with what we would see as kind of the medium-term historic trends. Clearly, as we have come into this year with the first quarter being softer, as you'd expect in real time, we continue to manage our investment allocation by brands. We tend to plan very much on a spend per hectoliter basis. So, if volumes are higher or lower, then we can flex or spend accordingly.","The good news is that because of the disciplines we have in our business around pricing and revenue management and the utilization of our ROMI model, that gives us flexibility as we go through the year. So, the last thing our business needs is any change in the strategy, but clearly, our tactics will continue to evolve as we go through this year and take kind of competitive pressures, industry headwinds, et cetera, but that's pretty normal. And I really would come back to the fact that the first quarter is relatively small. There's a couple of unusual events there. And as an executive team, we are still very committed to a full-year plan and our full-year guidance and we believe we have the flexibility in our P&L to deliver against that accountability.","Operator","Our next question will come from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, Amit.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","A couple of modeling question I'll maybe go on (38:14). One is the ordering problems in the Golden brewery, are they fully behind us or you expect them to continue to have some impact in the second quarter?","And then, Mark, you talked about having more flexibility and more levers there. And I appreciate your answer about having your spending tied to per hectoliter, but how much of that is contingent on competitive environment in the Premium Light segment? If you see more promotions and stronger competition, does it change your view on the spending level here?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Thanks, Amit. Gavin, do you want to just talk a little bit about our progress in relation to the Golden brewery? And then, I'll pick up P&L flexibility unless you've got specific perspective on the Premium Light segment, but start with Golden brewery.","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Good. Thanks, Mark. Good morning, Amit. Look, I mean, in February, as you know we went live with the new draft system in Golden and we had a slow ramp-up than we experienced \u2013 than we were expecting. We encountered a few challenges primarily with the brewery warehouse system that slowed our loading and shipping capability. And because of that, we did deal with low inventory and some out of stocks on some brands and PACCs. We've made progress in hitting our production and shipping targets. And though we're not quite fully caught up, we continue to drive progress to ensure that we're positioned well for summer.","And as it relates to going forward, obviously, we'll make the necessary adjustments to ensure a successful implementation at our upcoming rollout, specifically building more inventory at a distributor level than we did with Golden. I'd just also point out that Golden is one of the largest and most complex breweries in the world and we do expect our next rollouts to be smoother than that.","From an industry point of view, Mark, I would only add one thing to what you've said and that is that most of our plans and activities that we've got for this year started in the second quarter and weren't there in the first. And rollout of Sol, for example, which Mark mentioned in his opening remarks, are a new and enhanced marketing campaign behind Coors Light. All of these things are starting in the second quarter.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Thanks, Gavin. And, Amit, just to add, in terms of P&L flexibility in the Premium Light segment, we don't see anything unusual happening in the Premium Light segment from a competitive perspective. We are very clear about what our brands stand for, the consistency of positioning, the way that we're dramatizing that. Clearly, the dramatization of the Coors Light positioning in 2017 didn't meet our expectations and that's why we've sharpened that quite dramatically as we've come into 2018.","And the take-up and buy-in to the promotional activity we've got across our distributor network and Coors Light in particular and our partnership with YETI across the summer to really underpin the World's Most Refreshing Beer is the strongest we've seen for many, many years. So, we've got the flexibility, but we've got the plans there and we're going to drive those plans very consistently.","Operator","Our next question will come from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. So, I guess I had a couple of follow-ups. First, just in terms of the industry volume in the first quarter to down 3.8%, it does seem like that's a lot worse than what you or what we saw in the scanned data and clearly a big step-down in terms of the industry volume being down 0.5% to 1%. So, is this the other channel \u2013 sort of the non-measured channel that's doing worse? And I'm just really trying to reconcile the Nielsen volume versus the 3.8% number.","And it also implies in some of the other players at the high-end that's been gaining market share, if your market share was consistent, was actually not as strong. So, can you just talk about what's happened to the industry, broadly some of the channel dynamics and some of the high-end dynamics for your other players?","And then, I guess the broader question is just as we think about your performance also in the high-end, I mean I know that you've got a lot of plans in place to accelerate the growth, but you're seeing brands like Twisted Tea and Mike's Hard really doing very well from a volume growth performance standpoint. And I'm just wondering why you're not doing better, particularly in the high-end segment? Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hey. Thanks, Judy. So, Gavin, do you want to pick up on the high-end performance in the U.S. in a second? Judy, on the industry piece, obviously, we've talked to the fact that our STRs are down 3.8%. Consolidated U.S. industry in the first quarter was down about 2.3%. So, clearly, when you're looking at the scanner data, that's only given you a sub-segment of overall industry performance. So, total industry was down about 2.3% is our best and kind of the \u2013 I think consolidated U.S. industry estimate.","And as I mentioned, our share trends really didn't move as we came through the first quarter. Clearly, our ambition is to improve those share trends over time as to all of the portfolio work that we're doing. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit color on broader U.S. industry trends.","Gavin, I don't know whether you'd want to add anything to that. And then, do you want to talk specifically just about the focus we've got on getting our above-premium moving more positively?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. Sure, Mark. Look, Judy, we've made progress on above-premium, but we've got lots of opportunity there and we're excited about the activity, which largely, as I said, kicked off in the second quarter. We've got our new partnership with Heineken for the import rights to Sol and we've not been able to play in the Mexican import category. And as Mark said in his opening remarks, the initial reaction to Sol has been very positive from both our distributors and from our retailers and more recently, obviously because it hasn't been in the market long, from our consumers.","We've got the partnership with AriZona to sell Arnold Palmer Spiked and really we launched that with the 24-ounce cans with one retail chain customer and that did particularly well during the launch. And the 6-packs have only been out in the market for the last 30 days or so and we're seeing a strong uptake on that, which frankly is in direct competition with Twisted Tea, but it is really very early efforts.","And we have expansion efforts around our craft acquisitions. We've also got new packaging as I referred to, we've got brand innovations in Blue Moon, we've got it in Leinie's with the Summer Shandy 24-ounce, Crispin Ros\u00e9 is doing particularly nicely tapping into the ros\u00e9 segment and we just launched our Henry's Hard Seltzer in slim cans, which is the consumer-preferred pack and our variety pack is doing particularly well. So, I think we've got a lot of activity going on in above-premium, which will further drive growth in that segment for us.","Obviously, Redd's remains a challenge for us and we've sharpened the packaging and we're sharpening our flavor profile with both Redd's and Redd's Wicked and we expect that to have positive benefit going forward.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. So, I mean, Gavin, just to kind of try and tie all of that together for you, Judy. I mean, we are still underrepresented in terms of proportion of our above-premium portfolio. It's an enormous opportunity for us as a business. We've made, I think, very positive strides over the last few years and my belief is that there's still a lot of runway for us to go out. Our craft portfolio is in great shape and I believe that there's significant growth still to come from craft.","And we're now in hard tea, which we've never been in before. We've got a 1-2 punch on the import segment with Peroni, which is growing strongly, and Sol combined with that and with our FMBs as Gavin mentioned, Redd's is unsatisfactory from a performance perspective and that needs to remain essential to our focus.","And in the hard seltzers segment, we know of the pack that we didn't have last year, which is the slim cans and allows us to compete more assertively. And our innovation team continued to work on a range of further additions to that portfolio over time. So, I would say we're in pretty good shape and there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us and the team really are focused on exploiting this opportunity.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vivien Azer with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hi, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So, I wanted to ask a bigger picture question and it's one that I get from investors a lot and it's thinking about kind of the ultimate trough (47:13) share that we could see for the beer category within total beverage alcohol. One of the ways that I've tried to think about it is with age cohort segmentation, seemingly younger consumers drink across a multitude of categories which is perhaps different from a legacy beer drinker who would have been more of a category loyalist. So, can you offer any color on your own consumer insights work around beer preference by age cohort and how that informs how you're thinking about beer category share in a broader context over time? Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","And, Vivien, I'm assuming you're just referring to the U.S. as opposed to globally or any other specific market?","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Just the U.S., please. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. I mean, to be fair, that's a relatively long conversation. I think it's something we'd probably like to do on a pedestal and share with you when we get together in June. I don't know, Gavin, whether you'd want to offer any kind of just key headlines at this stage, but I think it's a critical question and it's certainly something we want to talk about as part of the context setting when we've got a little bit more time in our New York meeting. But, Gavin, any headlines you'd want to offer from a U.S. perspective at this point in time?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. Sure, Mark. And good morning, Vivien. Look, I mean, growth in wines and spirits has continued. There's no doubt about that. And consumer demographics, particularly with the younger millennial, the 21 to 27-year old has shifted with their preference shifting from beer to wine and spirits. The beer industry, overall, has become increasingly fragmented with a vast array of SKUs which has hurt us from a category point of view.","And there are a number of additional factors. You could call them macro cuts (49:00), right, such as cannabis and that is affecting the industry. So, question is what are we doing about it? And I think from an innovation point of view, we're doing a lot about it. Without wishing to be repetitive, we launched Arnold Palmer Spiked, we've launched Crispin Ros\u00e9 to tap into the wine drinkers, Zima draws a lot of its drinkers from outside of the beer category, as does Henry's Hard Soda and Henry's Hard Sparkling. Redd's Wicked, (49:27) comes from spirits primarily, as does Steel Reserve Alloy Series.","And more recently, we've introduced Two Hats into the economy space, which is a light-bodied lager with a little bit of flavor, which is specifically crafted to attract the 21 to 27-year old and get them to reconsider beers. So, as Mark says, we can get into more detail in June, but that would be a high-level commentary.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. And I think the only thing I would add to that, Vivien, is again, if you take a step back, the U.S. beer industry from a margin-filled perspective continues to expand and still accounts for 25% of the global beer profit build (50:09). So, we got to be a little bit careful that we don't get overly anxious about the U.S. beer industry when it's, A, so large, and, B, continuing to expand from a margin perspective.","Beer clearly needs to respond and our portfolio need to respond and we're absolutely in the middle of doing that, but it's something that takes time and we've seen that in other markets, other developed markets around the world as well. So, I really look forward to that, can have a longer conversation on that topic when we get together in New York.","Operator","And our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hi, Lauren.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, just looking at the profit performance in Canada, just as a starting point to this question \u2013 with the revenue shortfall, it looks like you managed to protect profitability really well there. So, with that as the backdrop, I was curious if you could talk a little about whether or not in Europe, outside of the year-over-year $50 million comparison and also in corporate expense, it looks like those two, there were some, I don't know, big swings versus how people were thinking about things and those had a huge impact on where EBITDA came in versus expectations bigger frankly than the shortfall in the U.S.","So, if you could just talk about if those things were sort of in line with your budgeting given that you don't give quarterly guidance and also the degree to which you did manage operating expenses relative to volume performance in the U.S., because also again you cited $30 million gross profit impact from supply chain issues and that's roughly what EBITDA missed by in the U.S. versus my numbers. So, to throw my arms around (51:56) kind of that protecting profitability and how much we saw that actually during the quarter underlying the reported aggregate results. Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Lauren. I think I managed to capture all of the components. So, let me try and unpack that for you. Back to Canada, I think you've recognized the continuing improvement there from an EBITDA perspective. Clearly, our revenue was impacted by the new revenue recognition methodology, but I feel good about the progress we're making in Canada and particularly the ongoing premiumization of our portfolio and the simplification of our below-premium portfolio.","Europe, I think, has been a very consistent success story over the course of the last two or three years under Simon's leadership. And from the top to the bottom of the P&L and from a cash flow perspective, we've seen very strong performance. It's muddier or more opaque in the first quarter because of the indirect tax provision lapping year-on-year and some of the changes to revenue recognition and the excise tax policy as well.","So, that makes things a little bit tricky to follow, but volumes up, shares up, underlying EBITDA continues to progress very positively.","Corporate expense, Tracey, do you want to just talk to corporate expense?","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. Sure. So, Lauren, if you're looking at our Q1 corporate expense versus last year, just a reminder, we were still ramping up the investments in our Centers of Excellence last quarter. So, that will be the big driver to this year, but our guidance for the full year is in line with our 2017 numbers. And as a reminder, the guidance is $180 million, plus or minus 10%. So, there's no significant increase in our corporate expense from prior year.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Financial. Please go ahead.","Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Tracey...","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Mark.","Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, Mark. Tracey, I guess this question is directed to you and it's really around the sensitivity on the $1.5 billion in free cash flow. If we assume your U.S. share and mix objectives are met, but say the industry is 2 points weaker than you're building into that $1.5 billion, can you give us a sense of how sensitive that is? I mean I have my own view just by running the numbers, but does that put you at the 90% level of the $1.5 billion? Does that put you below that number? Just trying to get a sense of that.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Tracey and you go (54:37).","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. So \u2013 and Mark, yeah, we committed to our guidance of $1.5 billion, plus or minus 10%, for this year. And just a couple of drivers of that in terms of levers, so obviously our income is a driver and that's why it's so important for us to deliver against our cost savings target, so that we can protect that bottom line and the EBITDA margin guidance that we have given. But some of the other levers in our balance sheet and our free cash flow is obviously working capital, so there's timing of working capital at year-end as well that impacts that as well as a lever to pull would be around our discretionary CapEx. So, whether we invest discretionary CapEx or not would be something that we could potentially look at, but we're committed to our guidance of $1.5 billion for this year.","Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thank you, Tracey.","Operator","And our next question will come from Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Please go ahead.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Look, it's a very simplistic question. So, the industry in the first quarter in total channels, you said was down 2.3%. And if I recall, last year, it was down 1.3% in total channels. I think the number comes from Anheuser-Busch. So, significant worsening in the first quarter. Can you try to say whether there's a lot of weather effect there or whether that's more secular-related in terms of the worsening? I'm just trying to get a picture of where we are in terms of industry volume trends. The first quarter much worse than last year, but how much of that was one-off?","And related to that, we're hearing a lot of noise about pricing, but, obviously, you have given us some very constructive pricing commentary in terms of your company. So, just give us some color in terms of how we should be thinking about the pricing outlook.","I have a follow-up, but if you can answer that, please, because at the end of the day, your share price is down to the levels of October 2015 before the SABMiller deal. So, I'm just trying to think in terms of what can get better here. You can answer that, but if you can touch on those two numbers, please. Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Thanks, Pablo, and I'll ask Gavin to talk to kind of what's happening from a pricing perspective. I mean I think your last comment was quite an important comment as well, because if you, again, take a step back and just look at our company, so the Molson Coors Brewing Company, at the end of 2015 versus where we finished up at the end of 2017, our volume is up 62%, our EBITDA is up 81% and our free cash flow is up over 100%.","And if you look at our free cash flow yield, which is running at double digits compared to the CPG segment, it's very, very competitive. So, I feel that as an organization from a scale perspective and a platform perspective, we put ourself in great position while also recapturing our, kind of, independence, which gives us much more flexibility going forward.","So, I think it's an important context point we can't lose sight although as we look at some nuances on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So, that would be, kind of, a headline reaction to your comment on stock price. If you come back to the industry in U.S., again I would reiterate the fact that the U.S. beer market is a great place to compete from a margin and profit pool perspective.","Clearly, U.S. industry on a full-year basis in 2017 was down about 1%, first quarter is down 2.3%. Our belief is that a big part of that has to do with very poor weather year-on-year. I think Gavin was mentioning that February in 2017 was probably the hottest or second hottest February on records. It was awful this year and beer is affected by that.","So, I'm not unduly concerned by some of the short-term trends we've seen from an industry demand perspective. And we have a 25% share. We don't have 75% in the market. That's a big opportunity for us alongside the premiumization of our portfolio. So, those are a couple of context points relating to, I think, two of your questions.","Gavin, do you want to talk a little bit about, I think, Pablo mentioned pricing noise in the marketplace?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Sure, Mark. And the only other thing I would add to your weather comment is in the very few states where the weather has been fairly comparable to last year 2017 in the first quarter, our trends have actually been much better than the overall MillerCoors trends. I'd start Florida (59:08) as an example. From a pricing point of view, our domestic net sales revenue per hectoliter has been pretty consistent for the last four quarters, Pablo. I've given you some direction and insight into how we think mix will look for the balance of the year.","And I would just add to that, that most of \u2013 in fact all our mix negativity in the first quarter is driven by package mix. In fact, our brand mix was slightly positive. As far as current activity, you always get activity going into the summer selling season and the first big holiday of Memorial Day and nothing terribly different to what we've experienced in prior years.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thanks, Gavin.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Alison?","Operator","And our next question will come from Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hi. Big question on \u2013 again, you guys a while back obviously were targeting flat volumes in 2018, growth in 2019 and clearly you stepped back from that. But I was wondering if you can reflect back and see where the shortfalls all are relative to you getting back, so I think what that would imply is a relatively stable market share. And then, as you go forward, there's obviously an emphasis on FMBs and flavors and things like that. If you could just offer thoughts on the ability for you guys to bank that as sustainable volume as opposed to, I think, what we've seen in FMBs and things like Redd's where you get a lot of trial, but repeat doesn't hold, if it's year two or year three beyond. Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. So, Gavin, why don't you pick up thoughts around FMBs? And, Fred, if you've got any perspectives on that as well in relation to Canada on the basis that we're now moving Henry's up into Canada, that would be helpful.","On your first question around flat in 2018 and growth in 2019, if you remember that, firstly, it's a strategic imperative for us to get our business stabilize from a volume perspective in the U.S. and then back into growth. And I'm not prepared and our executive team is not prepared for us to continue to watch volume disappear in the U.S. in such an important beer market.","The assumption around the aspiration really related to the fact that we assume that the beer industry will be relatively flat over the course of 2017 and 2018. Clearly, the beer industry has been softer than that. It doesn't change the strategic intent or aspiration that we have, but as I've said consistently, we will not do that at any cost and we'll do that in a methodical sustainable way. And if it takes us longer to get there, then so be it. It's tough work, it's important work and it's work that we are committed to.","So, we still have the same aspiration to get our business stabilized from a volume perspective in the U.S. You've seen some of the additions to the portfolio this year. And we continue to work on other opportunities as we look out into the future as well.","Gavin, do you want to talk a little bit about the FMBs and the importance to above-premium portfolio?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. Sure, Mark. Look, I mean, just to reiterate what I said, right. I mean, FMB statement is a very competitive segment. And Redd's is a very large brand within that segment and we had remarkable success with Redd's when we launched them in 2015 and part of 2016. It got our annual volume to around 1 billion barrels. This is a big brand for us. It generates profitability for us. And despite its challenges recently, it remains a big and profitable brand for us.","Redd's Wicked is \u2013 we're pleased with the performance of Redd's Wicked and we're leaning in hard there with new flavors. For example, Redd's Wicked Lemonade, which will be coming out shortly and we believe will challenge our competitors. And then, I spoke to Arnold Palmer Spiked, I spoke to sparkling water category, which we believe is sticky. We believe that's a category that will stay and grow and we intend to be strong participants in that with our new slim can and the variety pack, which we've just launched.","And then, of course, we've got Zima, which had a remarkable comeback last year and we're increasing our production and volume for that brand and we're actually lengthening its period, which it will be in the market from a Memorial Day point of view. So, that's how I would summarize our view on the Flavored Malt Beverage category.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. So, just a full stop on that, Brett, it's big, it's important and it will remain an important part of our portfolio and a lot of our existing brand efforts and our innovation thinking is designed to ensure that we participate fully in terms of the broader flavor opportunities I described from an adjacency perspective to be or so, you'll see more from it as we leave 2018 and go into 2019. So, more of that in due course.","Operator","And our next question will come from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Oh, thank you for taking a follow-up. Tracey, I had just a quick question on your COGS. So, I think for commodity inflation, you talked about $110 million headwind this year. Can you tell us how much that was incurred in Q1?","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","No. Judy, we don't split it up in a detail quarter-by-quarter. So, it's really what we're looking at for the full year 2018 versus our full year of 2017. So, we don't have the detail by quarter.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Thanks, Tracey.","Operator","Okay. And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Hunter for any closing remarks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Thanks, Alison. Thanks, everybody, for the time and attention this morning. We obviously look forward to seeing you in June in New York. Just as a reminder, as a leadership team, we continue to be fully committed to our 2018 plans. There's been no change to our guidance that would come to a small volatile quarter with a couple of big and moving parts in it, but we remain consistent behind our strategy around our portfolio, premiumization of our portfolio, our customer relationships and principally this primary focus on our cash generation deleveraging margin expansion. For 2018, we remain committed to that plan and we remain committed to our guidance. And we look forward to talking to you in more detail and sharing some of our emerging plans and talking about our capital allocation policy as well when we get together with you in New York in June.","So, thanks for your time and attention.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Before, we begin I will paraphrase the company's Safe Harbor language. ","Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today. So please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections.","The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.","Regarding any U.S. -- non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time to time by the company's executives in discussing the company's performance, please visit the website -- the company's website www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results.","Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year and in U.S. dollars, and the consolidated and U.S. segment results are presented versus pro-forma results a year ago, which reflects the acquisition of MillerCoors as is, and the related financing had occurred January 1 of 2016.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors. Please go ahead sir.","Mark Hunter","Thank you, Denise. Hello and welcome everybody to the Molson Coors earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. ","With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have Tracey Joubert, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, the CEO of our U.S. business; Fred Landtmeters, our Canada CEO; Simon Cox, the CEO of our Europe business; Stewart Glendinning, our international CEO; Sam Walker, our Global Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, the VP of Investor Relations.","On the call today, Tracey and I, will take you through highlights of our first quarter 2017 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective from the remainder of 2017. First quarter underlying earnings were lower than last year, primarily due to higher brand amortization expense and weaker January and February volumes in the U.S. this year, and because we're cycling strong earnings comparators from last year.","First quarter underlying after-tax income in 2016 increased more than 35% from the year before on a pro forma basis, partly due to the benefit of inventory dynamics and the timing of the Easter holiday. We've also made incremental investments this year to strengthen our global business and capabilities.","Despite a softer start this year, volume trends have improved since January and February. We're making great progress with our First Choice agenda in each of our businesses, and we're confident of delivering our full year business plans.","With the completion of the MillerCoors transaction late last year and the changes we're making to align and enhance our organization, 2017 will be a transition year as we build a larger, stronger company. Consistent with this, our results today reflect increased investments in the building blocks that will drive top-line growth, cost savings, profit growth, cash generation, debt pay-down and total shareholder returns in the years ahead. ","These building blocks are led by our First Choice for consumer and customer agenda, and are grouped into four areas. First, our organization and brands are now all under one roof. We are lifting and shifting best practices and world-class supply chain capabilities, and we're establishing global centers of excellence.","Second, our consumer excellence approach. As part of our First Choice agenda, we'll be building four-brand trademarks across multiple international markets. These four trademarks are Coors, Miller, Staropramen and Blue Moon. Within these trademarks, the global priority brands in 2017 are Coors Light, Coors Banquet, Miller Lite, MGD, Staropramen portfolio and Blue Moon Belgian White, which also includes Belgian Moon in Canada. We will reaffirm or update the global priority brands on an annual basis. These global brands supported by our national champion, craft and specialty brands now give the platform for accelerating performance outside of our core developed markets over time.","Third, our customer excellence approach. We're investing heavily in sales capability and execution improvement, including our new global commercial team First Choice learning center and a suite of leading edge sales technology and tools.","And lastly, our focus on talent development. Diversity and inclusion will help to drive our First Choice agenda and leadership capability across the enterprise.","In business highlights for the first quarter, we grew worldwide total brand volume 2.1% and our global priority brands by 6.6% in the quarter. We increased global net sales per hectoliter by 3.9% in constant currency versus the pro forma results last year driven by all of our businesses. ","We delivered transaction related cash tax benefits of $97 million in the quarter, more than 40% higher than our original planning expectation for the transaction. We now expect these cash tax benefits for full-year 2017 to be nearly $390 million, up from $275 million previously. And this represents an acceleration of these benefits, which were originally expected to be delivered more evenly over the next 15 years.","In the first quarter, we reported nearly $515 million of underlying EBITDA, a 3% decrease from the pro forma result, a year ago. However, in constant currency, our underlying EBITDA was unchanged year-on-year.","Underlying after-tax income was $165.6 million or $0.76 per diluted share. This result was down 12.1% on a pro forma basis, but more than 45% on a reported basis, which demonstrates a substantial earnings accretion from the transaction, even in a softer quarter.","Now, I'd like to share some regional highlights from the first quarter. In the U.S., on a pro forma basis, MillerCoors' domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, grew 0.2% for the quarter, as a result of favorable net pricing, partially offset by negative sales mix. We grew our share of the Premium Light segment with Coors Light completing its eighth consecutive quarter of increased segment share, while Miller Lite reached 10 consecutive quarters of increased segment share.","Coors Banquet has grown STRs for 10 consecutive years and accelerated its volume growth trends in the past two quarters. In above-premium, Blue Moon Belgian White returned to volume growth of low single-digits in the quarter. While the Leinenkugel's Shandy portfolio grew mid-single digits, Peroni volume was up high single digits having its best quarterly performance since the first quarter of 2012. Henry's Hard Soda, which was cycling successful launch last year along with REDD's posted lower volume in the quarter. ","Our below-premium brands declined low single digits, a significant trend improvement from the past several years, led by low single digit growth in Miller High Life, which had its best STR performance since the third quarter of 2009.","Keystone also grew achieving its best STR performance since the second quarter of 2010. Steel Reserve Alloy Series grew low double digits, while Hamm's STRs increased in the high teens, Milwaukee's Best declined low double digits in the quarter. Overall, U.S. STRs declined 2% for the quarter. ","Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 1.7% driven by higher input costs and volume de-leverage, partially offset by supply chain cost savings.","First quarter underlying EBITDA was $441.9 million, a 3.7% decrease versus prior year driven by lower volume and higher COGS per hectoliter, partially offset by lower brand investments and employee related expenses as well as net pricing growth. For perspective, our U.S. business was cycling a 17.7% increase in underlying EBITDA in the first quarter of 2016.","In Canada, net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 3.9% driven by positive pricing and brand mix. Coors Light and Molson Canadian volumes declined in the quarter, but their share trends improved versus the fourth quarter of last year, especially in Quebec and the West. Overall, Canada brand volume grew at 0.7% and we increased market share in the first quarter. ","We also continue to premiumize our portfolio through volume and market share growth in our import brands led by Coors Banquet, Above-Premium craft brands, through Mad Jack, Belgian Moon and Granville Island and Creemore, along with the return of the Miller brands to our Canada portfolio.","Canada COGS per hectoliter increased 10.7% in local currency, driven by mix shift to higher cost import brands, input cost inflation, including unfavorable transactional foreign currency impacts, and cycling a temporary reduction in distribution costs last year, with a partial offset overall from cost savings.","Canada underlying EBITDA decreased 25% to $42.9 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher cost of goods sold as we cycled a number of supply chain one-off benefits in 2016, along with increased commercial investments this year.","Europe net sales increased 19.1% in local currency for the quarter, driven by the release of indirect tax provision of approximately $50 million that we established last quarter, as well as the transfer of royalty and export brands from MCI, the addition of the Miller global brands and strong volume growth by Coors Light and Staropramen.","Our portfolio premiumization and mix management continued to drive positive mix in Europe. The strength of our Above-Premium brands including Coors Light, Staropramen inside of the Czech Republic, Sharp's portfolio, Franciscan Well and Rekorderlig Cider led to a 9.6% increase in brand volume in the region. The addition of the Miller brands and the royalty and export brands from MCI also contributed to volume growth and more than offset the negative impact of the late Easter holiday this year. ","COGS per hectoliter in local currency increased 1.7% primarily due to mix shift to higher cost products and geographies.","First quarter underlying EBITDA increased more than 7% to 8% in Europe due to release of the indirect tax provision, higher volumes, and increased net pension benefit. These positive factors were partially offset by an approximate $11 million bad debt provision established related to our customer in Croatia, along with higher brand investments, the timing of Easter holiday and unfavorable foreign currency movements.","Our international business increased brand volume more than 65% to 1 million hectoliters and almost doubled its net sales in the first quarter. This increase was driven by the transfer of our Puerto Rico business from MillerCoors and the addition of the Miller global brands as well as Coors Light growth in Latin America, partially offset by the transfer of Europe royalty and export business to the Europe segment.","In Latin America, excluding the addition of Puerto Rico, we grew Coors Light volume at high single-digit rate, which was driven by countries such as Mexico, Colombia and the Dominican Republic. Underlying EBITDA was $5 million, up from a loss of $1.4 million a year ago due to higher volume, positive pricing and favorable sales mix changes.","The Miller brands integration process is advancing as expected. We're leveraging existing platforms and partnerships in certain countries, while establishing new supply chains and partnerships in other attractive new markets. As an example, in Mexico, we're leveraging our relationship with Heineken and in Australia we're partnering with Coca-Cola Amatil to distributable both the Miller and Coors brands. We've also gained important businesses in new markets such as South Korea and South Africa.","Now, I'll turn over to Tracey to give first quarter financial highlights and perspective on the remainder of 2017.","Tracey?","Tracey Joubert","Thank you, Mark. And hello everybody. As a result of the MillerCoors transaction, today's results for the consolidated company and U.S. business are being presented in comparison to 2016 pro forma results, which are presented as if the transaction and its financing had been completed at the beginning of 2016. The segmental results for Canada, Europe, international and corporate are not being presented on a pro forma basis. With that in mind, following are our consolidated financial headlines for the first quarter versus pro forma results a year ago.","Net sales were down 0.5% in U.S. dollars in the first quarter, primarily due to lower U.S. sales volume and unfavorable currency movements, which were partially offset by the release of the indirect tax provision in Europe.","On a consistent currency basis, our net sales per hectoliter increased 3.9% in the quarter, driven by growth across all our businesses.","On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported net income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $201.9 million for the first quarter, down from $257.4 million of pro forma net income a year ago. This decrease was driven by lower special and other non-core items this year, along with lower U.S. volume, mix shift toward higher cost products, and higher global corporate costs.","Our first quarter underlying after-tax income was $165.6 million or $0.76 per diluted share, which was 12.1% lower than the prior year, driven by lower income in the U.S. and Canada, as well as higher global corporate costs.","Additional brand amortization expense of approximately $10 million in Canada was primarily related to changing the Molson brands to definite life in the fourth quarter last year. Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $514.9 million, 3.6% lower than the pro forma results from a year ago.","Underlying EBITDA in constant currency was unchanged from a year ago. We had said -- since last year that we look at value creation from the MillerCoors and Miller global brand's transaction through the lens of the sum of three numbers: underlying after-tax earnings per share, transaction related cash tax benefit, and transaction related after-tax book amortization. In the first quarter, these three numbers were underlying after-tax earnings of $165.6 million, plus $97 million of transaction-related cash tax benefits, and $11.2 million of transaction-related after-tax book amortization.","Also for those of you who want to calculate this measure on a per share basis, we had 216.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter.","Total debt at the end of the first quarter was approximately $12.3 billion, while cash and cash equivalents totaled $395 million, resulting in net debt of $11.9 billion. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the first quarter.","For the full year of 2017, we continue to expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million. Pension income of approximately $24 million, capital spending of approximately $750 million based on foreign exchange rates at the end of 2016, our consolidated net interest expense of approximately $370 million, plus or minus 5%, an underlying effective tax rate in the range of 24% to 28%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits, excess tax deduction or share-based compensations or adjustments to our uncertain tax provision.","This range is consistent with our current expectation for our long-term tax rate. We expect our cash tax rate to be significantly lower in this range, due to the cash tax benefits related to MillerCoors transaction. U.S. legislative initiatives to reform U.S. tax laws could have a significant impact on our tax rate and our cash tax expectation.","The post-transaction integration of our business and achievement of cost synergies are progressing well. And we continue to target more than $175 million of all-in cost savings in 2017, and $550 million of all-in savings by 2019. Related to this cost savings goal, we still anticipate incurring approximately $350 million of one-time incremental cash costs over three years to capture these synergies about evenly split between incremental capital spending and cash operating expense, primarily in the first two years of the program. ","While we continue to expect our transaction-related cash tax benefits to average more than $275 million per year for the next 15 years, we now anticipate that these benefits will be front-end loaded in the first few years. With the latter years, slightly lower than the $275 million average. As Mark mentioned, we now expect these cash tax benefits to total nearly $390 million in 2017. This accelerated delivery is being driven by faster than anticipated tax depreciation of tangible assets related to the MillerCoors transaction.","In addition, we now expect transaction-related amortization of approximately $45 million annually on an after-tax basis, up from $37 million previously, primarily due to the addition of the Miller global brand amortization. Also we now anticipate ending this year towards the top end of our 2017 underlying free cash flow guidance range, which is $1.1 billion, plus or minus 10%. We are generating cash ahead of our original expectations, primarily driven by the anticipated increase in cash tax benefit.","Note that our 2017 free cash flow targets still exclude brand capital spending related to building our British Columbia brewery. We expect our 2017 underlying MD&A expense in corporate to be approximately $170 million, plus or minus 10%. This is higher than last year, primarily due to three main factors. First, investments to drive our global growth agenda around brands, analytics and digital. Second, investments to drive world-class performance across our global functions, including supply chain, information technology and shared services, which are key areas of synergy savings for our company. And thirdly, enhanced global capabilities, including some transfers from business units to corporate as we build out centers of excellence.","As far as our cost outlook is concerned for the full year 2017, we continue to expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in MillerCoors to increase at a low single-digit rate, Canada COGS per hectoliter to increase at mid single-digit rate in local currency and our international business COGS per hectoliter to decrease at a double-digit rate.","And we now expect our Europe COGS per hectoliter to increase at low single-digit rates in local currency, up from a low single-digit decrease previously due to changes in mix. In the context of exciting changes across all our businesses, my two main financial priorities for the balance of this year have not changed. First, deleveraging our balance sheet through cash flow generation, and second delivering on our cost savings commitments to provide fire power to our top-line and bottom line.","At this point, I will turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap-up and Q&A. Mark?","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Tracey. In 2017, we will play to win via our First Choice consumer and customer agenda. So regionally looking forward, our U.S. goal of flat volume in 2018 and growth in 2019 has not changed, we will continue to invest in our flagship runs with Coors Light and Miller Lite plus Coors Banquet central to our investment focus.","Miller Lite has begun rolling out new creatives as an extension of the successful Spelled Different, Brewed Different campaign. With the tagline Hold True, Miller Lite is defining how the beer has not compromised on taste and emphasizing the product credentials make it the original light beer. ","We are also investing in Above-Premium and Redd's and Blue Moon Belgian White recently introduced new aluminum pint packaging. Leinenkugel's has introduced new packaging and its limited-edition lager, a collaboration with Germany's Hofbr\u00e4u M\u00fcnchen to celebrate the company's 150-year anniversary, and that will be available in six packs in June. And finally, the much-anticipated return of Zima will take place in time for the July Fourth holiday.","And our First Choice for customer agenda, our fact-based Building with Beer tool is driving value for our retail customers in the on-premise and convenience channels, and we're expanding its reach in grocery and liquor this year. Tenth and Blake, the craft and import division of MillerCoors, will continue to focus on integrating and rapidly expanding the geographic reach of our craft acquisitions.","Saint Archer, which had the fastest growth rate among the top 20 craft brewers selling in California, is expanding to Arizona, Oregon, Hawaii, Alaska and Washington. Hop Valley will extend its footprint this year to Nevada, Arizona, Colorado and Alaska. And Revolver, which is the number two regional craft brand in North Texas, is going to fill out its footprint across Texas in anticipation of neighboring state expansions in 2018. ","Finally, Terrapin, the number 3 regional craft brewery in share growth and its outreach, recently expanded into Ohio, Kentucky and Mississippi, and we are considering additional opportunities for later this year.","In Canada, we're seeing initial positive results from our First Choice agenda to bring momentum back to the top line, including a relentless focus on our two largest brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian. In the first quarter, we increased brand volume and market share nationally and in the West, partially due to the addition of the Miller brands. Looking forward, we're launching a new Molson Canadian campaign celebrating Canada's 150th Anniversary this year, and we're bringing this successful Climb On creative platform, nor for Coors Light. We're driving further growth in Above-Premium with our Coors Banquet, MGD, Mad Jack, Belgian Moon and the Heineken brand family.","We also plan to leverage Miller Lite and Miller High Life to further strengthen our Canada portfolio. Customer relationships are beginning to drive trend improvements, and in the on-premise channel, our national key accounts volume and market share grew at mid-single-digit rates. We also increased distribution of key brands and packages across Canada and improved in-store execution of our brand campaigns across all channels. The construction of our new British Columbia brewery is progressing well, with the formal groundbreaking taking place last week at our new Chilliwack site.","In Europe, we will continue to drive our First Choice consumer agenda for the existing portfolio and the addition of the Miller brands, and the royalty and export business in the region. We're also continuing to build our craft portfolio, including Sharp's, Franciscan Well, further expansion of Blue Moon in the region, and the purchase of a controlling interest in the La Sagra craft brewery near Madrid. As part of its expansion, Blue Moon has opened a new pub in Valencia in Spain, as a forerunner of many more to come in the years ahead. ","In customer excellence, one of our largest wholesalers in the UK, Nisa, named Molson Coors Supplier of the Year for this year, including being recognized for best service, and availability for the second year running.","Our international business is leveraging opportunities to grow the Coors and Miller brands in high opportunity markets, especially in Latin America and select countries in Asia and Africa. One action we are taking is to list and shift the original white can packaging for Miller Lite to all of its markets globally in the second half of the year. We plan to move away from most of the local transition sales and distribution agreements in the upcoming months and we'll utilize from partnering, export and local license agreements to expand the reach of our brands. ","We anticipate these new business structures will require upfront investments to grow our brands which will impact international profit growth in the near to medium term. Additionally we expect that the termination of the Modelo contract in Japan at the end of June this year will hinder performance in this profitable market. We are exploring ways to mitigate the impact of the loss of this contract.","So to summarize our discussion today, the first quarter underlying earnings were lower than last year primarily due to higher brand amortization expense, weaker January and February volumes in the U.S. because we were lapping tough earnings comparators from last year. Despite the softer start to the year, volume trends have improved recently. We are making great progress with our First Choice agenda in all of our businesses and we're confident of our full-year business plans. ","Additionally, we are generating cash ahead of our original expectations. With the completion of the MillerCoors transaction late last year, and the changes we're making to align and enhance our organization, 2017 will be a transition year, as we build a larger, stronger company.","Consistent with this, our results today reflect increased investments in the building blocks that will drive top-line growth, profit, cash generation, debt paydown and total shareholder returns in the years ahead.","Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual our prepared remarks will be on the website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon, and also at 1 PM Eastern Time today, David Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website. ","Additionally, in the next two months, we hope to see many of you at two events, firstly, we hold our Annual Meeting of stockholders on Wednesday May 17, 2017 in Montreal, and second, we'll host our Annual New York Investor and Analyst Day at the New York Stock Exchange on the afternoon of Wednesday June 7, again of this year.","At this point, Denise, we'd like to open up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a question from Vivien Azer from Cowen. ","Vivien Azer ","So, Mark, can I just follow-up on your commentary around the improvement that you've seen in the U.S. post soft January and February, can you quantify the rate of improvement?","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Vivien. I can't quantify the rate improvement, but I mean if you look at the scanner data, then we've certainly seen momentum improved through March and into April, a little bit interrupted by some of the horrific weather we saw in the U.S. over the course of the last week. But certainly feel good about the way momentum has built through March and again into April, and specifically in areas like our above premium portfolio, there is a lot of effort going into changing this trajectory on Redd's, and we're seeing that have a positive impact, the Blue Moon trajectory continues to be positive, alongside improvements that Gavin and his team have made on our below-premium portfolio, and the continuing share gains for our Premium Light, so -- but beyond that, I refer you really to the scanner data to check in for specifics.","Vivien Azer ","And just a follow-up to that. In terms of the net revenue per hectoliter in the U.S., would you be able to unpack that in terms of pricing versus the drag from negative mix? Thanks.","Mark Hunter","So, Gavin, do you want to pick that up specifically and just talk to a bit more detail on our top-line performance?","Gavin Hattersley","Sure, Mark. Good morning, Vivien. There are lot of factors that go into the makeup of our net sales, virtually the growth, Vivien, as you say, right, front line pricing, price motions and mix being the largest drivers. And if you stand back for a second there from a portfolio strategy point of view, just remember we play across the entire beer category, and you can break that down into the three segments of premium, above-premium and economy. And Mark touched on how we're doing with the various brands in his opening remarks, so I won't repeat that. ","Our performance in the first quarter impacted mix, which was negative about 30 basis points. But let me just remind you that, we were going up against significant launch volumes for Henry's Hard Soda and we had a very strong mix performance in the first quarter of last year as a result of that loading. We're through that comparison now, Vivien, and Henry's Hard Soda velocities are increasing steadily as we head into the summer months. Our economy strategy is working and that's not necessarily positive from a mix point of view, but it's really important part of defending our share in economy to ensure that we don't become irrelevant in a very large segment and we also need to recruit new millennial drinkers into our portfolio in the beer category as a whole.","Some of the other factors that make up price movement is, obviously frontline pricing, which in the first quarter was impacted negatively by the differential between sales to wholesales and sales to retail, which we've talked about on past calls. And just to remind you that our top line revenue is driven by sales to wholesalers, but our price promotions are driven by sales to retail, so that knocked a few points of our pricing in the quarter and that generally comes back over the full year.","We had a little bit of noise from price promotions in the quarter, as distributors caught up with reconciliations and then obviously freight and fuel retail operations and timing of the federal excise tax to actually draw back, so also other elements that kind of drive overall NSR per hectoliter.","And I guess my final comment on NSR, just to remind you, it's only one quarter, it's our smallest quarter. And so, some of the factors which I just described can have a little bit of a disproportionate impact. Pricing environment doesn't feel a whole lot different than it was last year. Hope that helps, Vivien.","Mark Hunter","Hey, Vivien, just to finish with a full stop [ph] on that, I mean, if you look at our pure net pricing, it was up about 0.5% in the quarter.","Operator","And our next question is from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. ","Andrea Teixeira ","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up a little bit over Vivien's question. Are you implying that over the quarter you're having a little bit of de-stocking with the price increase or \u2013 and we should be seeing better sequential improvement into -- as you come out of the first quarter, just want to clarify how the trends are. And as I said, you're comping against a very tough innovation calendar. So is that something that again, you're going to be seeing as a more normalized impact, and if you can comment on how the trends are between sales to distributors and sales to retail as we speak? Thank you.","Mark Hunter","Yeah, Andrea. Thank you. There was quite a few questions in your question there. So, if I start with your last point, which is around STWs and STRs, you got to remember that as we left 2016, demand generally across the beer industry in CPGs in the U.S. was really quite weak in December, which meant that we started 2017 with higher than anticipated stock within our wholesalers and that's why you're seeing a differential between STWs and STRs.","If you just look at overall consumer demand though as we've come through the first quarter, it was sluggish to start the year. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that certainly improved as we exited February and come into March, and then further into April notwithstanding that, a little bit of whack we got last week, due to some of the weather across the U.S., but generally our STRs have improved consistently as we've come into March and April.","With regard to the innovation agenda, I think Gavin mentioned the fact that we had a heavyweight innovation agenda in the first quarter of last year, with a lot of stock moving into the trade on the back of the Henry's Hard Soda launch. We've got further innovations coming into our business. Now we\u2019ve come into April, some of it new packs, and I also mentioned the fact that we're rolling Zima into our portfolio as well and that will come through in the second quarter. So I think to Gavin's point, now kind of [ph] balance itself out as we go through the year, so I wouldn't get too concerned on a one quarter basis, particularly as it's the smallest quarter of the year.","Operator","The next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. ","Judy Hong ","So Mark, I mean I know this is a small quarter and there are a lot of moving parts here. But this is the first quarter since -- the first full quarter since the MillerCoors deal closed. I think the investors have been waiting to see the progress that you are making on cost saves and the margin progression and certainly we didn't see that in the quarter. So, what would you say to those people who are really concerned, that all of your cost savings are going to get competed away or eaten up by volume deleverage and really won't see the profit growth improving?","Mark Hunter","Thanks for the question, Judy. I mean let me give you a couple of headline perspectives here. So there is a lot of noise in the quarter. I think when you cut to the chase in the quarter if you come all the way down to EBITDA and constant currency were flat year-on-year, our free cash flow guidance has been enhanced. So as Tracey mentioned, we now anticipate being right at the top end of the guidance we gave you on the last call. And myself and the executive team remain confident on our full year plan. We have a lot of change taking place in our business and just from a context perspective, the volumes were softer in January and February in the U.S. We are lapping about 35% after-tax performance growth in first quarter of last year. And we're driving a lot of change across our business, but on the very positive side, we saw a strong worldwide brand volume growth. We saw global priority brand growth. We saw positive NSR per hectoliter improvements across all of our BUs. And my perspective is, we're making very, very good progress on the integration of our businesses both culturally and operationally.","One of the things you have seen in the first quarter is that clearly we're investing in a couple of specific areas, which I think will stand the business in good stead, as we look out over the medium to long-term. One is the global commercial growth area, led by Kandy, which you're aware, I've put in place, and that now houses some of the significant investment that we'll be putting behind our global brand development as we look out through 2017 and beyond.","And then secondly, we're further investing behind taking our world class supply chain capability to the next level and that's very important to really underpin in a sustaining way, the drive for productivity and efficiency in our business. So in the cost savings number that we've given you, the $550 million over three years, we had already accounted for what I described as dis-synergies associated with the global growth team and the world class supply chain investments with clearly the majority of the synergies pick up through 2018 and 2019.","So, just remember the phasing associated with that so, we're investing ahead here to set the business up to build momentum, but actually, we're very good about both integration and the synergy planning and synergy delivery to date, as part of our overall cost savings. So I would just keep the context of this as one quarter, Judy.","Judy Hong","Just couple of follow-ups to that, so the increment \u2013 the investments that you are calling out, the couple of investments, are there any incremental in nature versus what you had thought to spend at the time of the closing of the deal or just really upfront investments and it's going to take some of the -- some time to get the synergies, so it's more of a timing issue.","Mark Hunter","Yeah, it's more of a latter, Judy. So there is nothing that's come as a surprise as we pulled our businesses together, we'd already anticipated and flagged the establishment of our global growth group and investment that would be required there, and taking more cost supply chain to the next level was again part of our thinking. The other thing that we have done as well, certainly from a corporate perspective, is we have moved some G&A from some of the businesses into corporate centers to really drive centers of excellence approach, so whether that's an HR, treasury, tax, really to drive much more of a one-way approach. And again, over the medium term to long-term that will give us enhanced productivity and efficiency in our business. So, we got to put that in upfront, then derive the benefits as we go through 2017 and then step change in 2018 and 2019.","Judy Hong","My last question, just the breakout of the Miller international brand contribution on volume, revenue and EBITDA, any color you can provide there? And why doesn't free cash be higher than even the high end of that $1.1 billion, just because now you're including the Miller brands internationally?","Mark Hunter","I'm not sure the Miller brand internationally can export free cash flow, but Tracey do you want to just talk to the free cash flow guidance?","Tracey Joubert ","Yeah, so it's just a couple of things Judy to consider as we look at our free cash flow forecast. So, we do have incremental CapEx and some of that is to deliver the synergies and cost savings. And we also have higher pension contributions, because we now have the 58% of MillerCoors contributions as well as we have incremental interest, because of the much higher stakes that we took on. So if you take those into account, they are sort of headwinds to our free cash flow","David Dunnewald","And Judy, sorry, this is Dave Dunnewald. I think your question on the free cash flow maybe now that we have more of the Miller global brands numbers flowing through why doesn't that have an effect on free cash flow? Actually we already had an estimate or we'd included Miller global brands in our guidance for free cash flow for 2017 when we gave it last quarter.","Judy Hong","Okay. And are you breaking out at all the volume and revenue or your EBITDA contribution or those trends?","Mark Hunter","No, we're not, Judy. I mean, that's not embedded in our businesses, and we'll report in aggregate both at segment level and then in relation to our total worldwide brand volumes, and our global priority brands.","Operator","The next question is from Laurent Grandet from Credit Suisse. ","Laurent Grandet ","I've got two quick questions. The first one is really a follow-up. So it's about deflation and shipments. So shipments declined by 4% in the quarter in the U.S. where deflation were down 2%. Now in Q4, deflation were down 2.8%, and shipments were only down 0.9%. So does it mean that we are now back to the right level of inventory with your distributors, and we should expect deflation and shipments to be more aligned going forward? So that's my first question.","The second one is about the marketing spend. You increased by about $25 million in the quarter, your marketing, general and administration, especially outside of the U.S. So how should we think about A&M spend going forward and will you continue to add them as a similar percent of sales? And also I mean could you explain what brands are receiving most support and what are the marketing initiatives you implement? Thank you.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Laurent. Again it was a lot in there. So, I think on your first question to keep it simple and Gavin may want to add some color to this. Our philosophy in the U.S. is to ship to demand. The only addition to that is making sure there is enough stock to ensure that from a customer service or distributor service perspective that we ensure that we don't have any other stock situations, but there has been a philosophy, and Gavin I think it's fair to say we'll remain our philosophy.","Gavin Hattersley","Yeah, Mark. You're quite right. I mean with this point in time, we do expect to ship more or less the consumption for the full year, but making sure that we do maintain service levels and our distributors did place increased orders at the backend of December, which did as you rightly point out increase our year-end distributor inventory by couple of days. And because of that, we didn't need to ship as much volume in the first couple of months of Q1, and that drove the difference which you highlighted. Our Q1 distributor inventory level at the end of the quarter, Laurent, was a little higher than last year's, we began our peak season inventory bode little earlier than normal to compensate for the Eden brewery closure, but as Mark says, our current expectation is to ship to consumption within the year.","Mark Hunter","Okay. Thanks, Gavin. And then Laurent, just to the second part of your question, when you look at the MG&A number, some of that is pure G&A relating to transfers of some people from the business units into corporate center or global roles. On the marketing side or the commercial side, one of the things I established when I came into the role and appointed, Kandy to lead this team as our global growth group, really focused on our commercial excellence agenda. So the investments, they are really going to cross five or six specific areas, building our insight capability, so we've just rolled up a global segmentation model to further direct how we build our portfolio, for global brand building. So there is a significant chunk of investment associated with the Miller trademark in making sure that we get that brand up and running positively.","One of the examples of that I just pointed to is that, we're changing all of the packaging on Miller Lite aligned with the U.S. packaging that had not been done ahead of our acquisition, that's a big initiative and we'll roll across all the markets towards the end of this year. So the funding for that is an example centrally. The other three areas are really are on building our digital capability and B2B, B2C in particular and commerce. Disruptive innovation and we've now got a small team focused on innovation as part of that building our craft brands internationally and I mentioned in my opening remarks, that we've now our opened our first Blue Moon pub in Valencia, this is the first of what will be many.","And then the final areas are under our customer excellence area focused on net promoter scores, category management and really driving stronger partnership, so that investment in the areas to support our intention and our capability right across our organization and it is more efficient for us to hold that potentially and to drive that kind of a cohesive approach. So, back to Judy's question, that's very much investing ahead of the curve to build the capability and performance of the business from medium to long-term.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus. ","Mark Swartzberg ","A couple of U.S. questions, and sorry, good morning Tracey too. On the economy side, Gavin, you're seeing some nice improvement with Miller High Life, you mentioned Milwaukee's Best is not doing well. When you think about what's going right and what can\u2019t go right from a larger economy perspective, how are you thinking about that? And then my second question for either of you Mark or Gavin is, the reasons to believe, you're sitting here with the view that volume will -- you're aiming for volume to be flat in 2018 and grow after that in the U.S., and obviously it's a deliberately challenging objective. But when you think about what you're seeing in your business today, and what can happen in light of your plans whether for economy or other parts of your portfolio, what's at the top of your list of reasons to believe that that will happen?","Mark Hunter","So Gavin, do you want to pick-up the economy question first, and just bring Mark and everybody else on the call up to speed with progress.","Gavin Hattersley","Yeah, sure, Mark. Good morning, thanks. Yeah. We've got several thrust on our economy strategy, Mark. Our overall objective from the beginning though was to hold that decline rate and get back more in line with where the economy industry portfolio share was going. And we've made really nice progress in the first quarter, which is really our first full quarter we're having the strategy in place.","The start of the show at the moment quite frankly are Miller High Life and Keystone Life as Mark stated in his opening remarks, they both had excellent performances that they haven't had for seven and eight years. And Miller High Life has been centered around the campaign, if you've got the time, we've got the beers, focusing on the iconic glass bottle and the sort of heritage of this brand, which has been around since 1903. Keystone Light is focused on the new visual identity, which really modernized the brand and it's been well received by our customers and consumers. We've replaced the 12 pack with a 15 pack, which has driven a nice share gain for us and we are leveraging off the stone's nickname.","We've also introduced Hamm's into the opening price point area. It's an area we didn't have a brand before and that brand has been around since 1865 and the early signs are encouraging. We've taken Mickey's back to the 40 ounce glass bottle. We've done and continued to accelerate Steel Reserve Alloy Series with a few additional flavors, which are doing nicely. And I'd say the area we need to do more work on is Milwaukee's Best. Not all of the changes we made to Milwaukee's Best have landed well with the consumers and we're of course correcting on that. So, I think as I evaluate how we are doing, we are off to a nice start and -- ","Mark Swartzberg ","And can you remind -- ","Gavin Hattersley","Sorry, Mark?","Mark Swartzberg ","No. Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you, Gavin, Sorry.","Gavin Hattersley","I was just going to say I have confidence this strategy is going to work as the year progresses.","Mark Swartzberg ","And it sounds like it is. I guess, two quick follow-ups. Milwaukee's Best, getting that right. How impactful is that? Just to remind us where it is as a portion of your economy mix? And then can you remind us like what the rule of thumb is when you -- in terms of profitability of your economy portfolio either versus your regular portfolio or the entirety of your portfolio, just a comparative profitability at the contribution level?","Gavin Hattersley","So, I will answer the first question, which was Milwaukee's Best, I mean it is the third largest of our economy brand. So the largest are obviously Miller High Life and Keystone Light and those were the two that are really working very well. So it's the third largest market. In terms of overall profitability, I'm not sure we've ever shared that, and you know for competitive reasons, I don't think I'd like to do that now either.","Mark Hunter","And Mark, the fact that the other part of your original question, which was you described as reasons to believe, so I think you\u2019re quite right to say that, we have set [ph] stretching ambition in Gavin's call to action is very appropriate, because it changes the mindset in our organization. It's a mindset which is not about managing decline, but building for growth. I do want to reiterate though that it is not a volume at any cost aspiration, so we want to improve our volume trajectory, get back to flat and then growth and do that in the right way from our P&L perspective and continue to manage our investments through our pack lens, so that remains really business critical for us in the U.S.","But I think the reasons to believe are when you really look across three big segments, the Below-Premium, Premium and Above-Premium, Gavin has explained what we're doing in Below-Premium and that was long overdue. It was a leaky bucket and we're making good progress, as steady as she goes in Premium Light and Coors Banquet and ideally we would have our two light brands in absolute volume growth territory. We touched that a couple of times, doing it consistently makes a big difference to our business.","And then in our Above-Premium portfolio, if you think craft imports and FMBs, making really good progress on crafts and import and more work to do on FMBs particularly REDD's. And as I have mentioned, a lot of work has taken place through April, which is starting to have an impact on that brand, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to build out our Above-Premium portfolio. We talk in Molson Coors about buy, build and borrow across our portfolio. So, Gavin, myself and the exec team are looking at further opportunities to further enhance our Above-Premium portfolio for the medium to long-term.","So, I think the important thing is, where our biggest volume areas are, we've made really good progress on the momentum building there. To use Gavin's language primarily, we still have some more work to do in Above Premium, particularly in FMBs, but we're all over that at the moment.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Holland from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. ","Andrew Holland","Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple, just no one mentioned your increase in your transaction tanks, up to $390 million and you've just said that's front-end loaded. Can you give us a bit of a clue as to whether it goes back down to $275 million next year or does it stay at this sort of level? And I'm just also wondering what you think is the reason why on a day when you increased your cash tax expectation so dramatically, even though, perhaps it's been a slow start to the year, your shares go down 4%. Can you give us any insight as to how you are looking at that transaction tax question, and whether there is any likelihood that you're going to include that in your sort of normal tax charge?","Mark Hunter","Yeah, so Tracey, do you want to take the first part of that question?","Tracey Joubert","Yes. So, Andrew, what we did say is that our cash tax benefit would be around $275 million on average over 15 years. We did say that it would be frontend loaded. So, hence the nearly $390 million in 2017. We are not giving guidance as to the next few years, but to the asset part of that 15-year period, that cash tax benefit will fall below the $275 million. So, I can't give you more details than that other than saying it will be frontend loaded for the first few years and then below $275 million for the best part of the year. I'm not sure how to answer the share question. If I'm you I probably wouldn't be sitting here and give the market share performance. So, Mark, I don't know if you have any?","Mark Hunter","Yeah. I mean I struggle with the second part of your question, Andrew, I mean, what we can do is report transparently how our business is performing and give you a sense of confidence in how we see the business over the medium to long term. Investors will make up their mind on the basis of that information. I feel very good about the fact that we are guiding direct [ph] towards the top end of our free cash flow guidance. And we look to update on a quarterly basis if that changes again. So, beyond that, I can't really comment. You probably got hypothesis, which is just valid as mine or anybody else.","Andrew Holland ","Well, I'm puzzled as to why and when you're expecting 15 years. As I look at my model, I'm afraid it's not going out to year 15, but most investors are interested in the sort of shorter term, I would suggest, by which I mean perhaps the next three years. And that number is a very considerable swing factor in your likely reported earnings. And the reason I'm puzzled is that some of your competitors who have also had sort of time-delineated tax benefits have just taken that as part of the normal tax charge rather than as effectively and as exceptional item.","Mark Hunter","Let's ponder that perspective and feedback and then decide whether there is anything we would want to do differently. I really appreciate your perspective, Andrew.","Andrew Holland","Big swing in Europe, was that just the $50 million, was that just a Q1 effect, the release of that provision or is there more to come in future quarters?","Mark Hunter","So, Simon, do you want to just pick up at both that specific question, and maybe just give a little bit more color on our, let\u2019s call, our underlying performance in Europe?","Simon Cox","Yeah, Andrew, to answer you specific, if you remember, we made a provision in Q4 of last year based on what we concluded at that time was a range of loss that was deemed probable. We've subsequently been to court, and actually won on all counts and therefore, we've taken the decision to reverse that provision. So it was a provision we made last quarter, if you recall, and it's been reversed out this quarter. So, it's a straight in and out, if you like.","In terms of the underlying performance in Europe, we were pretty happy with it. We've managed to grow volumes pretty significantly, and we've done that at the same time as growing our net sales revenue per hectoliter and I think any quarter where we can grow volumes and revenue per hectoliter in Europe, we will classify as a good one.","Within the volumes, there is a mix of stuff that we've inherited from the Miller brand and from exports and license, but there's also strong encouraging underlying growth and particularly in the areas where we're making our marketing investments in Above Premium. So Staropramen has been performing well across the quarter; Coors Light continues to grow well, our craft portfolio the Sharp's, Franciscan Well and increasingly Blue Moon is doing well. So where we're putting our marketing investments and where we're focusing on our Premium and Above Premium portfolio it's working nicely and we're pleased with the quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research. ","Brett Cooper","Good morning, guys. A couple of questions from my side. I'm not sure if you're going to give an actual number, but I was wondering if you could either give us kind of a relative sense of the incremental investments you've made that are sort of embedded in your quarter relative to the savings you've delivered. I think the actual numbers are just sort of bigger than a breadbox, smaller than a car type thing. And then, I don't know if the broader question on revenue synergy that you're seeing from the deal or see possible from the deal and then particular interest in, I mean, is there a need to play in the price point between mainstream and where you typical crafts sells, given that two of probably the most successful brands in the U.S. kind of play in that price point? Thanks.","Mark Hunter","So, Brett, just on the second part of your question, be more specific, because \u2013 ","Brett Cooper ","Sure. I mean, Especial and Mich Ultra sells over a 30% price premium to mainstream, right. You guys do obviously have a significant craft portfolio that sells at whatever 60% premium, you obviously have a significant mainstream, but there is nothing in that, call it that 25% to 30% price point.","Mark Hunter","Okay. So, Tracey, do you want to give some thought to the first question just on how the incremental investment and savings weigh against each other, knowing that you won't give a number but give us some thoughts. And then just to your second part of your question, Brett. On revenue synergies, again, I'll come back to the language I used earlier. We think about how we look at building our portfolio from a buy, build and borrow perspective. So buy, are there opportunities like we've done with our craft acquisitions in the U.S. or with Sharp's, as an example, build is create something from scratch. The Redd\u2019s was created from scratch a few years ago as was Henry's. Our borrow means moving brands from one market to another, so I think we're confident that we have now identified a number of opportunities where we can actually start to shift some brands from one market to another and Miller High Life is a good example in terms of the transfer between the U.S. and Canada and that's something that's very much work in progress. Now there are others as well, but I'm not going to talk to them specifically, because I think it's competitively sensitive.","With regard to the GAAP in our portfolio that you described, again I'd come back to my earlier comments, which is Gavin and the executive team are actively working on a range of options across buy, build and borrow further enhances our Above Premium portfolio in the U.S. and we'll talk to those in due course. So they\u2019re central to our thinking, we are working through a range of options and we'll update when we've got firm news that we can share. Tracey, do you want to talk to the first part of the question?","Tracey Joubert","Yeah. So, Brett, I'm not going to give you specific numbers, but maybe just a little bit of context. So in terms of cost savings, what we have said is we're going to be targeting to deliver more than $175 million of cost savings in 2017. In terms of incremental investments, I mean it's all according to plan. Our brand investments have increased across all of the BUs except for MillerCoors in the first quarter and Gavin just touched on effect that we had the Henry's launch last quarter, which was quite a significant launch. So and brand investments increased across all BUs. Our G&A was on plan and we did mention that there is some incremental investments that we are building in the corporate center around our customer excellence, around supply chain, as well as moving some cost to the center to provide global value-added services such as our global business services and some IT. But you know more than that, we're not going to give numbers.","Operator","Our next question is from Pablo Zuanic from SIG. ","Pablo Zuanic","I have two questions, but I guess, Mark, given that you asked why you're -- I will take the liberty to answer if you don't mind. You have promised $550 million of cost savings over three years. You have not told us how much of that is going to flow to the bottom line, so we're all left to make assumptions. But we assume 30% can flow, 50%, 70%. But this is a quarter where your EBITDA in the U.S. was down $54 million. And I work out that your savings quarterly should be about $30 million. So savings are supposed to be $33 million at MillerCoors per quarter. There is no seasonality in cost savings I suppose. And your EBITDA is down $54 million. So that's why the stock is down 5%.","Now I have two questions, okay. One, maybe I'm overly simplistic in my analyses but to be honest, when it comes down to Molson Coors as a stock, right, obviously, I don't look at what happens in London or Croatia. I look at two metrics. I look at your STRs in the U.S. and I look at your EBITDA in the U.S. I mean EBIT this quarter was distorted because of your increased brand amortization as you explained and bill-related amortization, so I can't look at EBIT. On STR front, your STRs being down 2% this quarter. It's actually great news. The comps get easier and everything you've told us toady makes us believe that numbers will improve. If it was just based on STRs, your stock would be up 5% today.","So the question I have for Gavin and then I'll move back to my EBITDA question is that typically for all the brewers whether it's [indiscernible] Constellation Brands, yourself, Anheuser-Busch, STRs are normally below the scanner data, and you've been 1 points to 2 points worse, and that's normally because liquor stores, bars and restaurants are doing worse than the mass major channel. But this quarter your STRs has actually been down 2% surprised me when this kind of data was telling me for the quarter down about 4%. So my question, Gavin, and you've talked already about the value brands and the number of initiatives you've said, can you give me any explanation or any color in terms of what's happening in liquor stores, bars and restaurants and major channels for MillerCoors that will explain why your STR is only down 2% in the quarter where this kind of data would imply something much worse. And I have a follow-up on the EBITDA question, but if you can answer that first, please? Thanks.","Mark Hunter","Okay. Thanks, Pablo. Thanks for the setup as well. So Gavin, do you want to talk about perspective on STR specifically?","Gavin Hattersley","Yeah, sure. Pablo, good morning. Look I mean, I'm not going to get into all the mechanics of why sometimes STRs don't match up with Nielsen or IRR, but what I can tell you is that, actually the on-premise volume trend in the first quarter was better. And that obviously is a little different to where it has been over the last four quarters at least of 2016. So that would be one of the drivers that would be causing you to have perhaps over estimated decline in our STRs. Our estimates are that we are closing the gap with the sort of industry trends on-premise. I would attribute some of that to our very successful Building With Beer Program on the on-premise which really is a fact based tool as Mark said in his opening remarks, that help our sales folk and our distributors sell to onpremise retail customers. So, that's probably the best answer I can give you for explaining some of that difference.","Pablo Zuanic","That's very helpful. So, Mark, then the second question is on the EBITDA front. Yeah can I?","Mark Hunter","Just before you enter the question, you mentioned a number on MillerCoors EBITDA and I don't recognize the number. So if you want to just kind of reiterate that and I hope I can clarify.","Pablo Zuanic","Right. Okay. Unless I'm looking at the wrong number, I thought the EBITDA -- for underlying EBITDA for MillerCoors was $442 million. And this quarter and in the quarter last year, the pro forma EBITDA number was -- sorry, the EBITDA, yeah and I'm looking at -- it was $323 million, right, and last year it was about $345 million, right, that's the MillerCoors EBITDA number, correct?","Mark Hunter","No. So the EBITDA number there...","Pablo Zuanic","No, I'm sorry, I'm looking at the pre-tax, I'm sorry, I want to repeat. I'm sorry, is what I said at the beginning, the EBITDA, the underlying EBITDA for MillerCoors for the quarter was $442 million and in the quarter last year was $459 million, correct?","Mark Hunter","Yeah. So it's down about 3.7%. And last year had grown by almost 18%. So, we're cycling what was an 18% increase in EBITDA in 2016. So I would describe as becoming a bit more normalized to use that language in 2017.","Pablo Zuanic","So a follow-up. So it's about an $18 million and $20 million decline. So, the question is very simple. I'm just trying to understand whether there is any one-offs or factors that would explain why there was an EBITDA growth in the quarter when you are supposed to have these cost savings coming through. I mean, obviously your shipments were down 4%, so that explains part of the fact, the issue. Your pricing apparently was not enough to cover the higher costs, right. So, the question, I guess, I can just boil it down to very simple. Cost savings $175 million for the year. I calculate $130 million for MillerCoors. That's about $33 million per quarter. Was there anything in the first quarter that will make us think that there wasn't a lot of cost savings realized yet at MillerCoors in the first quarter and that we should see more of that as the year progresses ? Maybe Tracey, you can answer that.","And the last question, and it's related to the same subject, it's more at the corporate level. Again, if I'm looking at the right numbers, if I look at your EBITDA by division including corporate, corporate EBITDA went from minus $25 million in the first quarter last year to almost minus $50 million this year, still increased, although we are supposed to be in a cost savings program here? So those are my two questions, Tracey, if you can answer? Thank you.","Tracey Joubert","So, just in terms of MillerCoors and I'll ask Gavin to jump in. But the MillerCoors did deliver cost savings and we are not going to detail it by BU but they did generate fairly significant cost savings, but the biggest driver on the EBITDA was the volume, so no specific one-off, but the volume did account for all of the sort of negative drivers.","Gavin Hattersley","Yeah. I think, I mean, the only other thing to add would be if you look at our COGS performance in the U.S. in Q1 of last year, our COGS were down about 5%, our COGS this year in the U.S. increased by 1.7%, so there was a number of very positive tailwinds we had in the first quarter of 2016, some of which are not repeated in 2017. So probably some more of that detail would be worth taking up on the follow-up call today, probably. And then, your question on corporate, I mean, I think I've dealt with that which is that some of that relates to us investing ahead of the curve in commercial and supply chain and also transferring some cost of the business season to the center, so we can drive a more of a consistent approach and drive efficiency and productivity over time. So I think you should start to see that kind of stabilize and get comfortable with as we go through the year. Obviously, we've had to kick things off and invest ahead of the curve as we establish our new organization.","Pablo Zuanic","That's very helpful. And if I may, just one last one for Gavin. So you\u2019ve talked about a number of metrics in the U.S. business in terms of volumes. Can you just talk about the Light, what you call the Premium Light beer segment, Coors Light, Miller Lite, Bud Light, as a segment, is that beginning to stabilize now that space for craft is not being expanded at retail and that bars and restaurants, does that help Light in any way? Does it help it stabilize? What are you seeing there at the category level? I realize that you're gaining share in that segment specifically. Thanks.","That's all.","Gavin Hattersley","From an overall category point of view, Pablo not much change. Where the change has come is obviously with our share within Premium Light, which has grown for the last 25 straight months and so that's a fairly prolonged period of share growth. So I'm pleased with the performance of both the Coors Light and Miller Lite. It's not driven by pricing tactic, it's in our view driven by the superior product and the marketing campaign, so they are really resonating with the consumers. I think overall though, to cut to the chase of your question, Premium Lights are still declining in total volume, and fairly consistently.","Operator","Our next question is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","So just one question from me, and I guess, probably it may tie back to a little bit of how you just answered the previous question. But I think, one of the questions, we've fielded this morning a few times is just if you take out the net effect of the gain, that the tax reversal in the UK netted against the bad debt provision, if you stripped that out of the EBITDA, you're at like, EBITDA down like 12% on an underlying basis in the first quarter. And, I guess, it's got people kind of confused with, if anything you've kind of raised the free cash flow guidance, understanding that some of that is coming from the change in the tax piece. But, I think, people are trying to reconcile how EBITDA could be down that much, and yet there is no change to the rest of the year. And so, I guess the question is just, are there some other things that you compare to the rest of the year, where EBITDA should be better year-over-year than what we saw in the first quarter? If you could just kind of reconcile those, I think that would be helpful?","Gavin Hattersley","Sure. I mean, I think, it's going to play into some of the comments already made, Bryan. The first quarter is a small quarter. We're investing ahead of the curve in two or three areas, which I have already mentioned to you. There were a couple of headwinds as well for example about debt provision that we flagged as well. So I think, some of it is timing, some of it's the fact that this is a small quarter, some of it's the fact that we're getting the business ready for delivering on the growth agenda, and our First Choice agenda.","I remain confident in our business plans on a full year basis. So, there is certainly some noise from, I would describe as a phasing and a timing perspective and we're lapping a very significant, very successful launch in the U.S. last year as well with Henry's as we have talked to. We've got the Canada amortization as well which flows through as a headwind on the business. So, there is a few puts and takes, but the important thing is, when you start right at the top of our P&L and we've seen strong global brand volume growth, we've seen our global priority brands grow and we've seen our NSR per hectoliter grow as well across all of our business units, even when you net out the benefit associated with the release of the provision, you still have NSR per hectoliter growth in each of the BUs. So, I always feel good if the top of the P&L is in the right shape, because then everything below that's a decision for management to make. So, I remain confident about the position of our business and our outlook relative to our plans for this year.","Bryan Spillane ","Thanks for that. And I guess, I just wanted to make sure I was interpreting it correctly, but what I sort of interpreted today was that, if you look at the top-line with the exception of the U.S. being soft in January and February which was unexpected, it sounds like, generally, the rest has been in line or even better than maybe what your expectations were going into the quarter, is that fair?","Mark Hunter","I would say, more in line with expectations, I mean it's great to be able to reference the fact that we've seen our top-line in Canada and our volume and our market share grow. As Simon pointed out, we've seen strong volume growth on NSR per hectoliter growth in Europe. Our international business took a big step forward in the first quarter. But clearly as we go through the year, there'll be some more volatilities [indiscernible] some of the TSAs, et cetera, but that's very encouraging and in the U.S., as I think we've tried to identify January and February were slower than anticipated trends through March and most of April have come back much more positively. So, if you look at the fundamentals of our business, if you look at the commitment we've made on a three-year basis on cost savings and flexibility that that gives us, then I don't think anything material has changed from where we were as we left 2016 and how we started 2017.","Operator","Yes, sir, I have Robert Ottenstein from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Robert Ottenstein","I am trying to get at some of the questions, we've been asking it maybe a different way. You've mentioned I believe that you're going to have $175 million of costs that will run through the P&L this year to take out the synergies. Can you tell us how much of that $175 million went through the P&L this quarter?","Mark Hunter","Yes. So just to be clear, Robert, what we said is the cost to get the synergies, we said that's about $350 million over three years, about half of that is OpEx and half of that is CapEx, but that's over three years. We've never said that that was a one year number in 2017.","Robert Ottenstein","Well, can you tell us how much was spent in the quarter to achieve the synergies?","Mark Hunter","No. It's not a detail we go into, I mean I think we've given you the guidance on $550 million of combined savings, about $350 million incremental to get those and sustain them split 50:50 between CapEx and OpEx. And as we've mentioned pretty consistently the synergies tend to ramp up and accelerate as we get into 2018 and 2019. So Tracey, I don't know whether you would add some color.","Tracey Joubert","Robert, I'm not sure if you're confusing the cost savings synergies that we've given guidance for this year at $175 million. So, we expect to deliver $175 million of cost savings in 2017, not spending.","Robert Ottenstein","Okay. What I'm trying to find out is how much you spent in the quarter to achieve the synergies. And I think Mark said that you're not going to disclose that number?","Tracey Joubert","No.","Mark Hunter","We understand the question, but Dave?","David Dunnewald","Yeah, Robert, we're not going to disclose the specific number, buy you can look at page 10 of the earnings release and see a line in there that gives you acquisition and integration related costs that have been excluded from our underlying results. And that would be a part of the cost achieved synergies, call it operating expense if you like, it does not tell you what the CapEx, and it also doesn't tell you about some of the other areas where we're enhancing in our business that Mark talked about earlier, where we're spending there as well. ","Robert Ottenstein","So you've got that one bucket of costs that are highlighted on page 10, and then you've also mentioned this other bucket of costs in which you're investing ahead of the curve, can you tell us what that number is for either the quarter or the year?","Mark Hunter","No, the $550 million number we've given, Robert, over the three years is net of the, let's call it, the dis-synergies, but we haven't broken either by line item or by timing. So the $550 million number is net of that. What you've got the difference in phasing, so I'll make it real for you, Kandy and his team are now in place and they're working on lots of initiatives, one of which I mentioned earlier, which is the rollout of Miller Lite packaging globally later this year. So that\u2019s -- and it's real and it's happening now. Some of the synergies which then start to offset the dis-synergy flow through towards the end of 2017 and then really ramp up in 2018 and 2019. So you've just got a difference in timing and phasing of these things, that are either feathered into the business or the cost is removed from the business. In a perfect world, it would all start on day one and it would flow seamlessly in a complementary nature, it doesn't operate like that, which is why \u2013 ","Robert Ottenstein","No, I appreciate that. So, key takeaway, the gross cost take-out is well over $550 million, the $550 million is a net number?","Mark Hunter","Yes, that's correct.","Robert Ottenstein","And in terms of this investing ahead of the curve, so to speak, how much of that are things that are going to be people costs, that are going to be a permanent part of the cost base and how much is more one-time items like the cost to switch the packaging, is there any way to kind of give us a sense of that?","Mark Hunter","Well, I mean, I can't get into that level of detail. Clearly, things that are one-off are going below the line from a U.S. GAAP perspective and we've identified those on our release. There are some things like our world-class supply chain capability, some of our centers of excellence, our global growth team which are here to sustain our business over the medium to long-term, so they will be embedded in our business going forward. Because it makes sense as we build our business, but the synergy and cost saving number we've given you is net of those incremental costs.","Robert Ottenstein","And then finally, I understand you're not giving us the investment cost for the year, and you're not giving us the cost to achieve the synergies for the year. But, I mean, has most of it been incurred this quarter, what's the kind of general cadence you expect for those investment items or cost items throughout the rest of the year?","Mark Hunter","Again, Robert, I mean, you're trying to push me again to specifics not quarter-by-quarter basis, I'm just not going to go there, because this is quite volatile depending on the nature of the initiatives and, if I start doing now, it becomes very difficult from a comps perspective. I think you want to look at the $550 million over the three years, look at the $350 million spread across OpEx and CapEx, form an opinion as to what that should look like from a phasing perspective and I really don't want to get below that level of detail.","End of Q&A","Operator","And this concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Swinburn","Thank you, Martina. Hello and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. With me on the call is Stewart Glendinning, Molson Coors CFO; Dave Perkins, COO of Molson Coors Canada; Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors; Mark Hunter, the CEO of Molson Coors U.K.; Kandy Anand, President of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors Chief Legal and People Officer; Zahir Ibrahim, Molson Coors Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors VP of Investor Relations. ","On the earnings call today, Stewart and I will take you through highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some initial perspectives on 2012. For Molson Coors, the fourth quarter was a positive finish to a challenging year, with underlying after-tax income up more than 42%; earnings per share, up 47%; and net sales growth of 12%. The fourth quarter benefited from solid pricing, an additional week in our fiscal 2011 calendar and cycling comparatively weak quarterly results the year before. ","For the full year, net sales increased 8% and underlying earnings per share grew nearly 6%, driven by positive pricing, cost reduction initiatives, favorable foreign currency movements and an additional trading week. Our focus in 2011 continued to be on the 3 pillars of our growth strategy, namely to grow profitably in our core businesses to advance in innovation, to grow in new and emerging markets and, when it meets our strict shareholder return criteria, to grow through M&A. ","In 2011, our primary focus remained on the first of these pillars as we continued to invest in our key brands and fill our innovation pipeline. Increased sales, pricing and underlying earnings tell us we are moving in the right direction. In Canada, during 2011, we grew volume and profit in the back half of the year to improve performance of Coors Light, Molson Canadian and our above premium portfolio, highlighted by the launch of Rickard's Blonde and the expansion of Creemore and Granville Island into new markets. ","Our Canada team secured the key national hockey league sponsorship property, which is adding visibility to our brands. We introduced Molson Canadian 67 Sublime and Miller Chill Lemon, and we expanded Molson Canadian 67 into Qu\u00e9bec and Molson M into Ontario on the west. In the U.S., Coors Light significantly outperformed the premium light segment, in both share and average price and became the second largest beer in the market. The Blue Moon brands continued to lead the craft beer segment, with more than 20% growth. Leinenkugel's also grew to double-digit rate. These brands drive the Tenth and Blake business, which is focused on our craft and import brands. We introduced value-driving innovations, including Coors Light Super Cold activation and expanded the Miller Lite aluminum pint, Leinenkugel Summer Shandy, Blue Moon Seasonals and Batch 19 all into new markets. ","However, the Miller Lite performance was a disappointment. In a very challenging U.K. market, we gained market share, and in the first half of the year, successfully completed a major SAP system implementation and then focused on brands and innovation in the second half, with the result being accelerated share performance. We acquired the Sharp's Brewery and Doom Bar brand early in 2011, added the Modelo brands to our portfolio and relaunched Carling and Coors Light in the second half. We introduced aluminum bottles for Carling, Coors Light and Caffrey's, and we had a limited launch of Carling Chrome and Anim\u00e9e. ","Also in the second half of 2011, we initiated a multi-year redevelopment program for our U.K. brewing network, which will support brand growth, innovation and operations efficiencies in the years ahead. The second pillar of our growth strategy, our approach to international organic growth, is based upon disciplined market development, strong strategic partnerships and sound investment in our brands. Specifically in 2011, we expanded our Cobra partnership to include the Indian subcontinent, which now gives us global control of this promising premium brand. Together with our partner, Obolon, we set up a commercial venture to sell Carling in the Ukraine, Eastern Europe's second-biggest beer market, and this venture is off to a very strong start. ","We continue to experience depressed markets, cost inflation and subpricing environments, exacerbated in the U.K. by punitive excise tax increases. This is a situation we do not see improving for some time. In M&A, the Sharp's acquisition has gone exceptionally well,, with the Doom Bar brand growing strongly, and now it is in the top 3 U.K. on-premise cask ale brands. The India partnership is also off to a solid start. These pillars of our growth strategy, paired with disciplined cash use and cost management, are designed to drive profit, cash flow and long-term share [ph] value to our shareholders. ","During the past 4 years, we have used our cash to capitalize on growth opportunities, strengthen our balance sheet and double our dividends per share. In 2011, we further strengthened our balance sheet by settling 1\/4 of our cross-currency swaps for approximately $100 million and paid down the outstanding Ontario beer store debt with $94 million in cash. In addition, following the announcement of our $1.2 billion stock repurchase plan in August, we repurchased approximately 7.5 million Class B shares by year end. Stewart will provide more details in a few minutes. ","Beyond our growth pillars in 2011, our Resources for Growth Two cost reduction program delivered $60 million in savings for the year and a total of $126 million in savings since the program began 2 years ago. And in the area of corporate social responsibility, Molson Coors was selected for inclusion in the Dow Jones sustainability index, which is the most recognized global benchmark of sustainability on nonglobal corporations. We were 1 of only 6 North American food and beverage companies chosen to be in this index. ","So with that as an overview, I'll now turn it over to Stewart to give fourth quarter financial highlights and perspective on our 2011 cash generation and uses. Stewart, over to you.","S. F. Glendinning","Thanks, Peter. Hello, everyone. In the fourth quarter financial highlights, worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors increased 2.6% on a 53-week basis. Excluding the 53rd week in our fiscal 2011, worldwide volume decreased 0.1% driven by decline in U.S. volume, which was largely offset by volume growth in our U.K., International and Canada businesses. ","Total company net sales increased 12.2% in the fourth quarter primarily driven by the 53rd week in 2011, along with higher sales in the U.K., International and Canada businesses. On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $176 million or $0.97 per diluted share was 42.4% higher than a year ago, driven by improved financial performance in each of our businesses. For our total company, the 53rd week increased 2011 worldwide sales volume by about 300,000 hectoliters and boosted pretax profit by an estimated $9 million. ","It's important to note that our fourth quarter underlying earnings exclude some special and other noncore gains, losses and expenses that net to an $8.6 million pretax charge. These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning. In segment performance highlights for the fourth quarter, starting with Canada, underlying pretax income increased 22.2% to $129.9 million, driven by increased net pricing, MG&A expense reductions, the addition of NAB contract brewing income this year and the additional week in our fiscal 2011. ","The extra week in the fourth quarter added about 140,000 hectoliters to Canada sales volume and an estimated USD $12 million to pretax profit. This benefit was slightly offset by the $2 million impact of a 1% year-over-year decrease in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. Sales-to-retail or STRs increased 7.1% in the fourth quarter, largely due to the additional sales week in 2011. Excluding the extra week, comparable fourth quarter STRs increased 0.2%. Our Canada market share declined approximately 0.5 share point from a year ago. Net sales per hectoliter increased nearly 4% in local currency, with more than 1\/3 of this driven by continued positive pricing and the remainder due to the addition of NAB contract brewing sales this year. ","Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 6% in local currency, with about half of the increase due to the cost of brewing beer under our NAB contract, and the remainder driven by higher distribution costs and input inflation. These factors are partially offset by RFG2 savings in the quarter. Marketing, general and administrative expense decreased 5% in local currency, largely due to lower employee incentive compensation and other overhead expenses in the quarter. ","Moving to our U.S. segment, underlying pretax income increased 27.2% to $85.5 million in the fourth quarter, driven by higher pricing and the results of cost savings initiatives, which more than offset the impact of lower volume and higher input inflation. MillerCoors domestic STR declined 3.3% on a trading day adjusted basis, while domestic sales to wholesalers declined 1.6% with the variance to STRs driven by the quarterly timing of shipments last year. ","Domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, grew 2.9% primarily due to frontline pricing. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 0.9% in the quarter driven by higher freight, packaging innovations, brand mix and commodity inflation, partially offset by continued cost savings. MG&A expense decreased 3.7% for the quarter. In our U.K. business, fourth quarter underlying pretax income increased 29.4% to $34.8 million due to overall higher volumes and lower pension costs, partly offset by lower net pricing and higher marketing investments. ","These results reflect minimal profit impact from a 1% depreciation of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar, and the additional week in 2011. STRs increased 16%, reflecting a strong performance in both the on-premise and the off-premise channels: customer buying ahead of our 2012 price increase and the cycling for U.K. weather in 2010 and the approximate 165,000 hectoliter benefit of the additional week in 2011. Excluding the impact of the extra week, STRs increased 9%. With overall industry volumes decreasing an estimated 1.4% from a year ago, this represented share growth for us in both the on-premise and the off-premise. Own brand net sales per hectoliter decreased 1% in local currency, driven by a 6% lower net pricing largely offset by the mix benefit of adding the higher-priced Modelo brands. ","Net pricing in the quarter was impacted by an increasingly competitive market dynamics and adverse customer impact mix in the off-premise, partially offset by positive pricing in the on-premise. Total cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased approximately 2% in local currency driven by fixed cost leverage from higher volumes and cost savings, partly offset by input inflation and the addition of the Modelo brands. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased nearly 2% in local currency due to higher marketing investments and the impact of the 53rd week in 2011, partly offset by lower employee incentive and pension expense. ","Now to help improve visibility into our international business, we began separating results for these operations from our corporate expenses for the first time in the fourth quarter. The international segment posted an underlying pretax loss of $7.5 million in the fourth quarter, and this $2.2 million improvement from a year ago was driven by increased sales of higher-margin brands this year. International volume increased 51% due to the addition of the Modelo brands in Japan, along with the growth of Carling in Europe and Coors Light in Latin America and China. ","Net sales per hectoliter increased 24% and cost of goods sold per hectoliter grew 16%, primarily due to sales mix improvements, including higher sales of Zima and Modelo brands in Japan and Carling in Europe. International MG&A increased 35%, driven by investments in our Ukraine, India, China, Spain and Russia businesses. Meanwhile, underlying corporate expenses totaled $52.3 million pretax for the fourth quarter. This reduction of $3.9 million was primarily due to lower employee incentive compensation. ","The 53rd week in 2011 added approximately $3 million of interest and overhead expense in the fourth quarter. Now moving beyond the fourth quarter operating performance, underlying free cash flow for 2011 was $635 million, down 31% from 2011 and $115 million below our original goal for the year, which was $750 million plus or minus 10%. While most of the free cash miss was due to timing of working capital, the result was, nonetheless, disappointing. ","Our 2011 cash generation was made up of the following: $868 million of operating cash flow, including $458 million from MillerCoors, plus $20 million of proceeds from asset sales in the Foster\u2019s swap unwind, minus $235 million of capital spending and minus $17 million of net cash invested in MillerCoors. Lower underlying cash for 2011 is primarily due to onetime cash sources in 2010 and higher capital spending, $58 million plus MillerCoors, as well as higher cash taxes of $24 million and higher working capital this year largely due to timing. ","Consistent with our usual practice, we plan to share our 2012 underlying free cash flow goal with you during our Investor Day in New York next month. Regarding cash uses in 2011, Peter mentioned our stock buybacks and partial cross-currency swap settlement and the Ontario beer store debt paydown. Totaling more than $500 million, these cash uses strengthened our balance sheet, improved our debt ratios with the rating agencies and reduced our share count at an attractive price. We ended the year with $884 million of cash in our balance sheet, and here are the details regarding the buyback. ","During the fourth quarter, we bought back approximately 1.2 million Class B common shares for $50 million in cash. Since the inception of the program in August 2011, we have repurchased approximately 7.5 million shares for $321.1 million, which is approximately 27% of the total program, and just over 4% of our outstanding Class B shares. As originally announced, we have been implementing this program opportunistically. As always, all potential cash uses will be vetted by our disciplined growth process and must meet our firm criteria of providing a clear view to building long-term shareholder value. ","Looking forward, regarding our 2012 guidance, we expect 2012 MG&A expense in corporate to be approximately $115 million. This would represent a $12 million increase from 2011, driven by higher incentive compensation and project expenses. We expect full year 2012 corporate interest expense to be approximately $100 million based on current foreign exchange rates, a reduction of $8 million from 2011. Turning to our effective tax rate, we expect a full year underlying rate for 2012 in the range of 17% to 21%, assuming no further changes in tax laws. While we continue to see our normalized long-term tax rate in the range of 22% to 26%. We anticipate that it will take a few years to move up to that range. ","Our 2012 capital spending outlook is approximately $200 million for the full year. This $35 million decrease from last year is driven by a lower capital spending in Canada following the installation of the new high-speed can line in our Montr\u00e9al brewery. Note that this capital spending guidance excludes the U.S. Regarding our defined benefit pensions for 2012, our preliminary view is that U.K. pension expense will increase about $10 million, that means from $7 million of pension income in 2011 to about $3 million of pension expense this year. ","In Canada, we anticipate that our 2012 expense -- pension expense will increase approximately $20 million from 2011. In the U.S., we expect a decrease of about $15 million, on an underlying basis, which excludes a $22 million special charge in the third quarter of 2011 related to MillerCoors assuming a multi-employer pension plan, that's at 42%. ","Taking these together, our total company 2012 pension expense is expected to be approximately $80 million, including our portion of the MillerCoors pension expense, which is about $15 million higher than 2011 on an underlying basis. This increase is driven by current long-term interest rates, which are now lower than at any point in the past 60 years. Meanwhile, we expect total cash contributions to our pensions to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million this year, up from $59 million in 2011. This is due to increased contributions in Canada and in the U.S. ","Looking ahead, our cost outlook in Canada for 2012, we expect our all-in cost of goods sold to increase at a mid single-digit rate per hectoliter in local currency, due to input inflation and higher distribution and pension costs, as well as the cost of brewing NAB contract volume, which was largely absent from our first half results last year. In the U.S., we forecast COGS per hectoliter to increase at a low single-digit rate in 2012. In the U.K., we expect our full year COGS per hectoliter to grow at a high single-digit rate in local currency, with about half of the increase due to input inflation; 40% due to sales mix; and 10% from onetime expenses related to our U.K. brewery improvements this year. ","The incremental brewery expenses will total about $8 million in 2012 primarily in the first half of the year, and we expect these improvements to provide significant returns in the years ahead. At this point, I'll turn it over to Peter for total company and regional outlook, wrap up and the Q&A. Peter?","Peter S. Swinburn","Thanks, Stewart. So we expect 2012 to be as challenging as 2011 in all of our markets. Additionally in 2012, as Stewart has outlined, we anticipate negative foreign exchange rates and increased pension expense. We firmly believe that we have to continue to focus on our core brands and new innovation to drive top line revenue, and this means growing Coors Light, Carling, Molson Canadian and Miller Lite. We also need to execute our innovation program effectively, and to help ensure this is achieved, we plan to invest incrementally in marketing this coming year. ","We will continue to grow our existing international businesses and move them forward profitably over the next few years. Finally, we will consider prudent value enhancing growth opportunities to M&A. Despite these efforts, we expect the early part of the year to be especially challenging, partly due to higher brewery, marketing and pension costs. Additionally, we will be cycling the release of a $3.8 million indirect tax reserve in Canada in the first quarter of 2011 and the volume pull-forward of the U.K. price increase, which we estimate pulled in nearly $3 million from Q1 2012. ","These factors will put increased pressure on Q1 results. And, of course, later this year, we will be cycling lower employment incentive expenses and the 53rd week sales in Canada and the U.K. By way of regional outlook, in Canada, beyond the focus on Coors Light and Canadian, we have begun full activation of the NHL sponsorship. That drives relevance to our brands with hockey fans, a key consumer group in Canada. Our -- the premium brands were highly successful in 2011 and finished the year with real positive momentum, contributing 1\/4 per share point of growth to our portfolio in the fourth quarter. ","Specifically, the Rickard's brands have benefited from some successful innovative brand launches. We will gain further geographic expansion of the Creemore and Granville Island brands with the Six Pints, our new craft and speciality group. Beyond our current offerings, we plan to introduce some exciting new brands unpackaging in 2012, which we expect will further strengthen our portfolio and our competitive position in Canada. ","In the U.S., we will unveil our new take on Miller Lite taste at our distributor convention in mid-March. Innovations such as the aluminum pint and the vortex bottle, have been well received by consumers and will continue to be a focus. We'll unveil the innovative Miller Lite Taste Flow Can along with new programs to drive Miller Lite engagement among our African, American and Latino consumers. With Coors Light, we'll continue to drive success with the super cold activation along with other packaging innovations such as the aluminum pint. We will also remain focused on multicultural programs that reach Hispanic consumers through local market soccer activations and the Coors Light Fan\u00e1ticos Del Frio website. ","Miller 64, the relaunch of MGD 64 brand, will be available at retail by the end of this month with bold new packaging and positioning. Tenth and Blake will continue to drive momentum around Blue Moon with Seasonals such as Blue Moon Spiced Amber Ale. We are also looking at extending the Leinenkugel Shandy brand with a version for the fall, and we'll continue to grow Peroni with a strong focus in the on-premise channel. ","Additionally, we will leverage our minority equity investments in Terracon [ph] beer company and in our acquisition of the Crispin Cider Company last week, which gives us significant and immediate presence in one of the industry's fastest growing categories. In the U.K., since our SAP system implementation in summer 2011, the team has -- was focused on brand building and innovation activities. In 2012, we will be launching a major investment focus on the refreshed positioning behind Cobra and Carling, plus Carling Chrome and further new Carling brand extensions. We will be on that consistently through spring and summer. And Coors Light will return with heavyweight support to build on last year's double-digit growth. We are well into the first stage of a multi-year redevelopment program in our U.K. brewing network in order to improve bottle innovation, flexibility and performance, including additional brewing capacity for Doom Bar, and will enable us to deliver on our brand and innovation agenda. ","By the middle of this year, we will have new flow up capability up and running, and a new energy center and flexible bottling line will be under construction for early 2013 commissioning. During 2012, Molson Coors International will continue to focus on leveraging the investments made in new markets and infrastructure over the past 2 years. The primary focus will be to continue to drive double-digit top line growth in the key strategic markets of China, India, Russia, U.K. and Spain, focusing on the key brands of Coors Light, Carling and Cobra. ","While we anticipate similar overall investment levels in these businesses in 2012 versus last year, we expect these investments to be somewhat front-loaded this year. Our overriding international goal remains to build this group of businesses quickly and to reduce our investment per hectoliter so that our international group becomes a significant contributor to total company profitability by 2015. ","Finally, the following are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in 2012. In Canada, our sales-to-retail for the first 5 weeks of 2012 declined at a high single-digit rate versus 2011. This decline is largely a result of calendar differences related to the 53rd week in 2011. The January volume reporting for fiscal 2011 included the week leading up to New Year's Eve, whilst this week is excluded from our early 2012 fiscal results. ","On a comparable basis, 2012 first 5-week STR volume is down low single digit versus 2011. In the U.S. for the first 5 weeks ended February 4, STRs declined at a low single-digit rate on a trading day adjusted basis. In the first 6 weeks of the quarter, our U.K. STRs decreased at a mid single-digit rate, largely for the same reasons as Canada. And in the first 5 weeks of the quarter, our international STRs have increased at a double-digit rate. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead. ","So to summarize our discussions today, the fourth quarter for Molson Coors was a positive finish to a challenging year, underlying tax income up more than 42%; earnings per share up 47%; and net sales growth of 12%. For the full year, net sales increased 8%; underlying earnings per share were up nearly 6%, driven by positive pricing, cost reduction initiatives, favorable foreign currency movements and the additional week in 2011. ","Despite some challenging market conditions, our focus continues to be on growing our business. Rather than waiting for the market to come to us, we're building on 3 pillars of our growth strategy, which are to grow profitably in our core business through brands innovation, to grow in new and emerging markets, and when it meets our strict shareholder criteria, to grow through M&A. Our primary focus remains on the first of these pillars, as we continue to invest in our key brands and fill our innovation pipeline and core markets. We will increase our investment behind our brands to drive top line growth and take advantage of changing consumer taste and new market segments as they emerge. ","Our approach to global organic growth is based on disciplined market development, strong strategic partnerships and sound investments in our brands. These growth strategies, paired with a disciplined cash use and cost management, will drive profit, cash flow and long-term value for shareholders. ","Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours. Also, at 2 p.m. Eastern time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. That call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website. So at this point, Martina, can we open it for the questions please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First, I guess, just in terms of the Canada performance, it sounds like the fourth quarter share was a little bit softer, so any color as to the competitive dynamics and how you're thinking about your ability to hold onto the pricing in that market. And it sounds like January trend, even excluding the extra week impact, was also still somewhat softer, so what are you seeing just in terms of the most recent trend there as well?","Peter S. Swinburn","I'll let Dave do the detail on that, but I mean, the one thing I would point out, Judy, is that if you look at the total year, then we've certainly seen improvement in Canada in the second half, from an industry basis point of view, which we're pleased to say. And also, as I called out, we're very pleased with our premium portfolio performance in Canada as well. But, Dave, do you want to talk to the specifics?","David Perkins","Yes, for sure. It's Dave. So, yes, what we've seen in Q4 was strong industry performance, up 1.8% when you take out the 53rd week impact. So we've had 2 quarters in a row that feel good. We've had good weather through those 6 months, but certainly I think, some of the value offerings and innovation that have gone into the market have made a difference. Consumer behavior seems to be changing. I think the folks are loosening up a little bit on their wallets, and so that's playing true well for us. In terms of the competitive environment, pricing bids continue to be very competitive right across the country through Q4. Consumers continue to respond to that activity. December is, obviously, a pretty important month, and I think, with the slow start to the year with the first half being soft, we did see a spike in activity and pricing activity in December, not to be unexpected. We gave up the 0.5 share point that you've referenced, that largely comes from our unsupported brands. Innovation continued to deliver about 3 share points for us in the quarter, which is really good. As Peter referenced, our import performance, which I had called out in Q3, as the softness actually strengthened up for us in Q4 so that was good to see. And if you look at the 10 or 11 brands that we put our focus behind, we grew a share or volume on all but 2 and we're able to get price increases through as well, so I feel good on that. Coors Light in Qu\u00e9bec, we gave up a marginal amount of market share because of competitive pricing. But Coors Light grew in the rest of the country. So overall, I think as we continue to play with the price and volume balance, it feels like we have it about right, but no doubt it's a competitive environment there and we'll continue to focus on that.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just following up the unsupported brands as a portion of your portfolio, can you quantify how big that is, and is that sort of a drag in terms of the share performance going forward or just in the fourth quarter given the competitive activity at the value end that just got hurt more.","David Perkins","Well, we've seen softness on the unsupported brands right through the year. They would likely -- I don't have a precise number for you, but I would say probably high single-digit or very low double-digit as a percent of our portfolio. And -- so what we try to do with those brands is migrate the drinkers through to the brands that we support over time. As far as your question on January, I mean, January is a small month for us. We are down low single-digit, so far, when you take out the 53rd week impact. It's difficult to establish a real pattern so far. There are some things in the market that feel good to me in terms of the pricing environment. We'll see how they play out through the rest of the quarter, but in the West, we have seen some selective price increases that seem to be in the right direction. In Qu\u00e9bec, we've seen -- but not brewer-instigated price changes, but retailer price increases, which I think were a positive sign. So there is some encouraging news there.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Stewart, just on the free cash flow generation in 2011, just in terms of the miss versus your target, just can you elaborate on some of the buckets, where that shortfall came from. And then, obviously, we'll wait for your March meeting, but just broadly speaking in 2012, it sounds like maybe you're making additional pension contributions. So your ability to sort of step up the cash flow side, and then the buyback, obviously, the pace seems to have slowed down in the fourth quarter, is that sort of indicative of maybe cash generation in 2012 potentially being a little bit more subdued than what you've previously thought?","S. F. Glendinning","Let me take those, Judy. So first, let's take the buyback first. I wouldn't necessarily connect those dots. We'll say that we bought back almost $325 million worth of shares, that's a huge chunk of money back to shareholders. It still left us with some almost $900 million in cash, which we think is an appropriate level. And we have said that we'd like to maintain flexibility, that's the reason I wouldn't necessarily connect any other dots, as you say, we will share with you, in a couple of weeks when we are in New York, our guidance for 2012 and we'll be prepared to explain all the details around that. With respect to the miss, we did call on the third quarter, as we saw the year turning out a little bit tougher than we expected, that we expect to be at the lower end of the range. Then, in fact, it was true, that played out, but what also played out were some timing items on working capital, and we expect some of that to come back in the next year. So if you'd looked at that, just to sort of dimensionalize that, somewhere in the $40 million to $50 million range, which explains the difference between the bottom of the range and the number we ended up with.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Dave, I wanted to talk a little bit more about Canada. And I was wondering, the comments you just made about feeling a little better about the pricing environment, and you remarked that Quebec, the retailers have started taking some incremental pricing. Can you talk a little bit more about Qu\u00e9bec, specifically, and anything else that leads to that comment about the pricing environment?","David Perkins","Yes, so in Qu\u00e9bec what we've seen, Mark, is that almost all of the major retailers have moved away from the minimum price, have moved away from that floor, and generally are up about $1 a case, a case being at 24, from that level, and that's just happened in recent weeks. And so we'll see consumer reaction and how that plays out, but that feels good. And then in Western Canada, it's really selective price increases that we or other brewers have been pursuing, that would reflect a strengthening environment there. In Ontario, the next catalyst to any pricing change would be the increase, the index increase for the minimum price. So on an annual basis, the minimum price has increased by, I think, it's a weighted average of the prior 3 years CPI. And in Qu\u00e9bec, the beginning of the second quarter, there is also a CPI adjustment to the minimum price there.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","In what month again?","David Perkins","That would be in April in Qu\u00e9bec, and it's in late March or early April in Ontario.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as we think about -- I mean, a month is only a month, but as we think about the portfolio kind of in recent months, if you will, it sounds like the share performance has been a little softer than what you would like. You mentioned these unsupported brands, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the evolution and trends for Coors Light, specifically, and Canadian, specifically?","David Perkins","Yes, Canadian continues to hold or grow share so the brand's performance is strong. It will be receiving pretty significant support behind the NHL property as we go through into the playoffs this year. So new piece of news on that brand, which, I think, will be really positive for it. We weren't able to activate heavily in the tail end of 2011 because of some legal uncertainty that you'd be aware of, and so certainly, as we go into this year, you're going to see strong activation there behind Canadian. All the equity tracking that we're doing is very positive, so we're seeing the equity scores on the brand move up at rates that we haven't seen before. Coors Light continues to be a very strongly rated brand in our consumer tracking. As I said in the fourth quarter, it grew or held share everywhere but Qu\u00e9bec, where there was some pricing challenges that caused a minor erosion of market share. But Coors Light continues to be a strong brand for us, and there's no question, moving forward, that the thing that is very important for us is the performance of those 2 brands. There's a number of other things we do in our portfolio around the above-premium brands and the Six Pints and so on, but we really have to have that strengths from Canadian and Coors Light, they'll both benefit from the NHL exploitation. They will both benefit from innovation going forward. So the plan feels strong, the equity measures look good and the performance is good, along with NSR increases, which is really important.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's great. So it really does sound like that -- that maybe the unexpected to-do item is these unsupported brands as you head into '12, is that a fair characterization?","David Perkins","Yes, I mean, look, the losses are happening on the unsupported brands. The reality is that we need accelerated growth on Canadian and Coors Light to offset those declines. I don't want to try to slow the declines on brands that don't matter to our future. It's how do we feed our major brands with the volume that comes out of those. And, as I say, innovation, hockey program and just good solid marketing and day-to-day sales execution are the things that are going to make the difference for us on that. And so we're pushing into those brands really hard, and they'll make the difference for us. So we always have the price volume balance that we can play with. We've been tracking some share loss through 2011 knowingly and we do believe that our brand need to get NSR growth. And -- so we'll continue to play with that balance, but I feel pretty good about the balance right now, actually, and I think it's really for our marketing programs to continue to accelerate the performance on Canadian and Coors Light.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's great, and if I could, finally on that. I don't know, Peter, if this is for you, but you've drawn our attention to the importance of marketing dollars not only in quality, but it sounds like in quantity. And I know you're not going to give us a percentage increase, but could you talk, maybe just directionally, about how you're thinking about the absolute level of support in the market of Canada today versus a year ago or even a few years ago, given the dynamics that have played out at the consumer and competitive level.","Peter S. Swinburn","Two things, first of all, we try to make it very clear in the script that we recognize that we've got to grow the top line of this business. I think there's probably 3 areas that we're focused on. One, obviously, is the more dynamic area around crafts. And I think we've done a good job, whether we look at the U.S., with Blue Moon, Leinenkugel; as you look at Canada, with Creemore, Granville Island, Rickard's; if you look at the U.K., with Doom Bar, if I can be really knock that out of the court to be honest with you, but it's a small part of the overall portfolio. We talked about adjacencies or the impact of wines and spirits, and I think we feel really good about the innovative ideas that we have to address some of that space. So, again, we're pleased with that, but, really, the biggest U.S. [ph], as Dave has called out is we got to get our power brands moving forward, and that's Miller Lite, Coors Light, Carling and Canadian. And that's what'll make the difference, and so we want to put our marketing dollars behind those, as well as innovation. To give you some scale, it's difficult, it'll be a minimum of $30 million, really depends on how much we put behind innovation at the top end of the scale, so I think I'll leave it at that, if that's okay, if that helps.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, so you're saying on those brands, on a combined basis, an incremental $30 million versus last year.","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes, as a minimum.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","At least as a minimum, great. And then just more on the modeling side, that's helpful. But over on the modeling side, Stewart, the pension up -- I'm not sure I even got it right, but I think you're saying pension up $80 million, is that the right number? And can you just give us the replay there on the amount by region?","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes -- not, Mark, sorry, can I just come back, because you did reference Canada. My $2 billion [ph] is talking about the total business, okay.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Across regions, right. And that's on a 42% basis for the U.S. or that's excluding the...","Peter S. Swinburn","That excludes the U.S., I'm sorry...","S. F. Glendinning","So, Mark, let me just make everything clearer. So just to recap, what we said is that the U.K. will increase $10 million year-over-year. That'll move from a pension benefit, up $7 million in 2011 to $3 million of expense this year, $10 million year-over-year, then. In Canada, we expect expense to increase by $20 million from 2011, and then in the U.S., we actually expect a decrease of about $15 million on an underlying basis. So just ignore the $22 million that we saw come through this year, it was a special charge related to a multi-employee pension plan. So take those 3 things together and then you end up with about a $15 million year-over-year total for the company. $80 million is the total expense for the [indiscernible].","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher from JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just want to follow up on a comment you had made in the prepared remarks, where you talked about 2012 being just as difficult as 2011, and just wanted to get a better handle on, is that from a market development standpoint, is that from an overall financial performance standpoint. I wasn't quite sure exactly where you were sort of taking us with that comment.","Peter S. Swinburn","Thanks, John. Thanks for giving us the opportunity to expand on it. All we're trying to lay out there is when we look at the external environment, we certainly don't see things getting worse, but we certainly don't see them getting better to any great extent. If I had to put money on either side of that, and probably we expect it to get slightly better, but most importantly, not worse. That means that 2012 externally looks the same to us as 2011. Within that, however, we will continue to focus on what we think is important. I'll go back to the comments I just made to Mark about focusing on our core brands, especially the big brands and putting money behind that to actually generate top line growth. Does that help?","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It does and then I guess, the next question would be sort of -- and I know you guys don't give guidance, if the markets are about the same from your financial stand -- I mean, we're expecting tax to go up. Do you feel like your financial performance can be similar in 2012 as it was in 2011?","Peter S. Swinburn","That sounds like guidance to me, John.","S. F. Glendinning","I always say, it's not true we don't give any guidance. Of course, we do give guidance around MG&A and around our tax rate, and around the capital spending, around our COGS, it's some important elements. What we don't give is guidance around our top line.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Watson from HSBC.","James Watson - HSBC, Research Division","I had a quick follow-up on Canada. First, just about the competitive environment. I was hoping you could break it down a little more in terms of whether the competition -- the competitive pricing is more on the value segment, which I might imagine is your unsupported brands the ones struggling, and I imagine those are skewed towards value as well. And if you could just break down value versus premium and maybe smaller competitors versus your main competitor in the competition.","David Perkins","Yes, all right. On the pricing, it really comes into play at the premium and the above-premium level, it's actually rather than value, I mean, value tends to sit down close to the minimum price, anyway, so you will have some movement there, but the majority of the pricing action that we see is in the mainstream and above. And I would say it was across-the-board when you look at the competitive environment. We do see the smaller regional and national brewers active in this area on an ongoing basis, but certainly I would say through the fourth quarter and into December, it was fairly broad-based as opposed to regionally and across the industry.","James Watson - HSBC, Research Division","Okay. Are the price gaps between value, premium and above-premium staying about the same, then?","David Perkins","Yes, there hasn't been any fundamental shifts in that. There are certainly is, anytime there's a major price promotion going on in a market. You may see above-premium come down -- and this isn't just brewer action, it is sometimes retailer action. So, for instance, in Qu\u00e9bec in December, the retailers used the above-premium import brands as traffic builders, and so you'll see a fair amount of discounting there. And they'll come down fairly close to the price of our regular brands, and so it varies by region, what you actually see. But generally, the price gaps, on an ongoing basis, are holding up and we're seeing the action, as I say, in the premium and above-premium.","James Watson - HSBC, Research Division","Great. And then I just had another question on the U.K. Also, on the pricing environment there, I just noticed that you guys had a 6% lower net pricing kind of on your core brands, and at the same time, great volume and share gains there. So I was just wondering, that almost sounds like just from those stands, that you guys are the ones discounting there in order to gain share. But if you could give me a little more background on that competitive environment and anything I might be sort of missing in that quick analysis.","Mark Hunter","It's Mark Hunter here. I mean, I think you have to set a little context here. We've had about 19 quarters of total pricing growth in the U.K. when you include mix on unit pricing, 17 quarters of pure unit price growth as we've come through 2011 through Q2 through to Q4, we've had to be a little more competitive in the marketplace. The U.K. market from a volume perspective remains challenging, and certainly from an off-trade perspective, we've seen that competition increase pretty significantly. So our strategy is very clear, which is about driving for revenue growth. Wherever possible driving for value ahead of volume, and we remain flexible and employ tactics where required. So we're very clear about what we're about as a business, and I think we're responding to the market on a real-time basis.","James Watson - HSBC, Research Division","Are there -- I mean we've seen a lot of quarterly swings throughout 2011, but just going into 2012 compared to kind of entering 2011, is there a significant shift in where this market is?","Mark Hunter","I don't think there's a significant shift. There's one dynamic that has moved, it has been, really, the softness in the off-trade market. There are volumes in the off-trade over the last year, so we've actually finished last year where our total industry was down on a full year basis about 3.5 points and off-premise was down 3.7, on-premise was down 3.4. Now that's the first time for a long time that I can remember the off-premise volumes actually being softer than the on-premise. I think it's too early to tell whether that's a sustaining trend but it's certainly interesting and a shift in dynamic.","Peter S. Swinburn","If I can just build on that, James, again, just to step back from the minutia a little bit, if you look at the U.K. market, it's still roughly 50-50 on-premise, off-premise. We have consistently grown share in the on-premise. That's where your brands are built and where your brands remain, and they're not susceptible to fluctuations or promotional pricing. In the off-premise, Mark and his team have been very diligent in terms of trying to move pricing up, but what you've seen is actually just the strength of our brands. When we choose to be competitive in that area, we actually do exceptionally well. And so we've always got that lever to pull if we choose to pull it. So strategically, we're in a very strong position in the U.K. as to which way we want to go, and I think Mark and his team have done a great job putting us in that position.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of questions around -- I just want to make sure I captured some of the incremental costs for 2012. So pensions are an incremental $15 million, the tax rate's going to be higher, and then the corporate MG&A, I think if I took it down right, it's $115 million. Does that compare to -- what number does that compare to for 2011, is it $104 million?","S. F. Glendinning","It's going to be $12 million higher. And I guess, the only real difference in corporate this year is to point out that there's about $1 million that's in there that's related to the 53rd week. So that'll be the only small thing to point out, but [indiscernible] the actual year-over-year versus $103 million is the number to point to.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then Resources for Growth were about $60 million of contribution in 2011, is that right?","S. F. Glendinning","There's $60 million of savings in 2011, and another $24 million to go in 2012. Based on the current program, let me be specific about that.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And so we may hear more about something more incremental on that in March?","S. F. Glendinning","Wait to see how we frame it up in March, but, yes, the current program has $24 million still to go.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just, I guess, in terms of looking at gross profits for next year, gross margins for next year, is -- do you have all the pricing in place that you need at this point to cover your cost of goods per hectoliter outlook and also just how volatile could your cost of goods be, how much of your costs are locked in at this point?","Peter S. Swinburn","I'll let Stewart take what's been locked in, but we've given guidance on our COGS. But I'm not going to give guidance on our top line pricing. We'll let you sort of work through that.","S. F. Glendinning","The only thing I would say is that U.S. is taking pricing at the end of the year, and U.K. is also taking some pricing. So we'll have to see how that plays out during the year, but as Peter says, we're not going to give any guidance on what we might do over the course of this year. With respect to COGS, we don't give real guidance in terms of what specifically is locked. What I will say is that in the marketplace, you are seeing the pressure from some of the brewing materials and continued fuel pressure, I mean, that's publicly available data. What is important is that you just reflect on the mix and how that's impacting our business. So I don't think you see as much volatility in parts of our business because of our hedging. We will be subjected to these broad inflationary pressures, which we haven't baked into the COGS numbers that we've given you. And because of the mix differential in our various businesses, so, for example, Canada uses a high percentage of returnable packaging, whereas the U.S. is almost all nonreturnable packaging. That's the reason we give you COGS by the year to help you model that.","Operator","There are no further questions in the queue.

Swinburn","Thank you, Martina. Hello, and welcome, everybody to the Molson Coors Earnings Call, and thanks for joining us today. So with me on the call this morning are Gavin Hattersley, Molson Coors CFO; Dave Perkins, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors Central Europe; Stewart Glendinning, CEO of Molson Coors U.K.; Kandy Anand, CEO of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors Chief Legal and People Officer; Zahir Ibrahim, Molson Coors Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors VP of Investor Relations.","On the earnings call today, Gavin and I will take you through highlights of our second quarter results for Molson Coors Brewing Company along with additional perspective regarding our acquisition of the StarBev business and our outlook for the balance of the year.","During the quarter, we financed and closed the acquisition of StarBev, which we now call Molson Coors Central Europe. In order to provide a comparable basis for underlying -- for understanding our new Central Europe business this morning, we provided historical U.S. GAAP results for Central Europe on a pro forma basis as if we had owned the operations since the beginning of 2011.","In summary, we believe the EBITDA margins for this business are sustainable, synergies will be delivered and capital spend will be at the lower end of our original expectation.","Here are some of the financial details. We completed the acquisition on June 15 with a final purchase price of EUR 2.7 billion, the equivalent of USD 3.4 billion. In pro forma U.S. GAAP, the purchase price represents a multiple of 10.8x 2011 underlying EBITDA. This is a reasonable multiple for a business with a good long-term growth profile and we expect it will be earnings-accretive in the first full year. Poor February weather and local FX impacted first half results, but the business delivered strong market share growth and recent performance is in line with our expectations.","For 2011, Central Europe pro forma results under U.S. GAAP included net sales of $940 million, an underlying pretax income of $182 million, the underlying EBITDA of $317 million. Gross margins as a percent of net sales was 44.2%, underlying EBITDA margin was 33.8% and underlying operating margin was 19.3%. These results confirm that the business has a solid margin structure on which to grow.","We financed the acquisition with $2.8 billion of new debt at very low interest rates along with more than $600 million cash in hand. We are taking immediate steps to capture $50 million in annualized pretax operational synergies by 2015, and we expect the purchase of our new Central Europe business to drive positive returns for shareholders towards the early part of the 3- to 5-year range that we used to evaluate significant investments.","In terms of what Central Europe brings operationally to Molson Coors, this business sold 13.3 million hectoliters of beer last year and has the #1 brand in more than half of its markets with strong positions in the rest.","On a pro forma basis, for 2011, Central Europe makes up 22.7% of our worldwide volume, 12.3% of net sales including MillerCoors and 16.2% of underlying operating profit.","We now own the worldwide brand rights to Staropramen which is growing strongly in many of the 30 countries where it is sold. In a number of markets, we have licensing or distribution agreements with third parties for Staropramen and other brands and we expect these to continue under the same conditions as prior to the transaction.","We also see opportunity to increase our Central Europe market share through branding and packaging innovations, including introducing Molson Coors brands like Carling.","In summary, our first couple of months with this business confirm that this acquisition fits squarely into our strategy to increase our portfolio of premium brands and deepen our reach into growth markets around the world. The Central European market is attractive with strong historical trends and upside potential. Our Central Europe business is a market leader in the region and this acquisition provides Molson Coors with a great platform for growth.","Shifting gears now to our second quarter financial results for Molson Coors. Underlying after-tax income for the second quarter 2012 increased 8% to $250 million, driven by positive performance in our U.S. business and the inclusion of 2 weeks of Central Europe results in 2012. Underlying earnings per share increased 12.2% to $1.38, which includes the benefits of 2 weeks of Central Europe results and fewer shares outstanding this year. Gross margin including MillerCoors declined from a year ago while underlying operating margin increased.","Regionally, the U.S. had a good quarter, but the U.K. and International businesses reported lower underlying earnings. In Canada, we grew earnings in local currency, but this was offset by negative foreign exchange in our reported U.S. dollar results. Central Europe pro forma pretax earnings declined in the second quarter, but outperformed the industry. Based on the macroeconomic environment in Europe, we see some industry-related risk to our near-term performance, but we have encountered no negative surprises in the business and current performance is in line with our expectations. Gavin will provide additional financial highlights in a minute.","In brands, second quarter Coors Light sales to retail grew 4% with solid volume and market share growth in all of our regions. Most of Canadian trademark STRs in Canada grew in the quarter. Miller Lite declined low single digits while showing incremental trend improvement versus the first quarter. The Carling brand declined in a weak U.K. economy that also suffered its wettest April to June period on record. Our Central Europe brands grew 1.4% on a pro forma basis.","In innovation, the launch of Coors Light Iced T in Canada has delivered strong consumer awareness and trial and is performing in line with our expectations. In the U.S., the Coors Light Aluminum Pint and Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy are consistently exceeding expectations. In a depressed U.K. beer market, the launch of Carling Zest has exceeded our expectations with this new brand picking up listings in most of the major grocery chains.","With that as an overview, I'll turn it over to Gavin to give second quarter financial highlights and a perspective on the second half of 2012. Gavin?","Gavin Hattersley","Thank you, Peter, and hello, everybody. In second quarter financial highlights, Molson Coors second quarter underlying earnings increased 8% to $250.1 billion while earnings per share increased 12.2% to $1.38 per share. The addition of Central Europe results drove approximately 40% of the increase in underlying earnings per share. The Central Europe impact is made up of $19.7 million of underlying pretax income in the last 2 weeks of the quarter, partially offset by $5 million of acquisition-related interest expense in corporate.","Regionally, MillerCoors has contributed a positive underlying profit performance in the quarter with a 7.2% increase, driven by continued solid pricing and cost reductions. In Canada, positive volume, pricing and cost reductions are offset by negative foreign currency in the quarter. The U.K. had a challenging quarter due to lower volumes, increased marketing and pension expense.","Now, a note about how we are presenting our results following the Central Europe acquisition. In order to provide the most useful information, our discussion regarding Central Europe will center on pro forma results for both this year and the comparable prior year period. A discussion of consolidated, Canada, U.K., International and corporate results will be on the same basis as before StarBev.","So on a pro forma basis, Central Europe underlying pretax income in the second quarter declined 37% driven by unfavorable foreign currency, channel and geographic mix along with higher input costs and brand investments.","Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors increased 6.4% due to the addition of 2 weeks of Central Europe results. Excluding Central Europe, worldwide volume decreased 1% driven by lower volume in the U.K. and U.S., partially offset by growth in International and Canada.","As we did last quarter, I will provide an overview of our results with MillerCoors presented as if it were proportionally consolidated. This is a non-GAAP approach but we believe it provides a useful view of some key performance metrics for our business.","On this basis, total company net sales increased 5.7% in the second quarter driven by the U.S., Canada and International. Net sales per hectoliter decreased 0.8% in the quarter due to the addition of 2 weeks of Central Europe sales at a lower NSR per hectoliter, which more than offset solid pricing in the U.S. and Canada and the addition of NAB contract brewing revenue in Canada.","Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 0.4% due to input cost inflation, higher pension expense and the addition of contract brewing volume in Canada.","Total company gross margin was 41.5%, 70 basis points lower than a year ago primarily due to the U.K. and International performance.","Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 8.2% due to the addition of 2 weeks of Central Europe results including acquisition-related costs, higher pension expense, increased brand investments in Canada and International and cycling lower employee incentive costs in Canada last year.","Underlying operating margin was 17.2%, up from 16.9% a year ago due to margin growth in the U.S. and the addition of 2 weeks of Central Europe operating income this year.","Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier in the morning for a detailed review of a our business unit financial results in the quarter including for Central Europe on a comparable pro forma basis. It's important to note that our second quarter underlying results excludes some special and other noncore gains, losses and expenses that net to $178.9 million pretax charge. These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results primarily relate to the Central Europe acquisition and financing and are described in detail in this morning's earnings release.","In the second quarter of 2012, our Resources for Growth cost reduction program delivered $14 million in savings and a total of $150 million in savings since the program began over 2 years ago. As a result, we have achieved our 3-year RFG2 program target of $150 million 6 months early. MillerCoors achieved cost savings of $32 million in the quarter and we benefit from 42% of those cost savings.","Underlying free cash flow for the first half of this year was $335 million. This $213 million increase over last year was primarily driven by year-over-year change in the timing of working capital. Our first half cash generation was made up of the following: $397 million of operating cash flow, which includes $305 million from MillerCoors plus $125 million of net add-backs for acquisition-related costs, purchases and sales of businesses and other assets.","Cash outflows were $81 million of capital spending and $106 million of cash invested in MillerCoors. Regarding cash uses, we did not repurchase shares during the second quarter. And as we mentioned when we announced our Central Europe acquisition in April, we do not expect further repurchases until our debt ratios are closer to pre-acquisition levels.","Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $4.9 billion and cash and cash equivalents totaled $516 million, resulting in net debt of $4.4 billion.","Looking forward, we are updating our 2012 guidance in a number of areas principally because of the Central Europe acquisition. We now expect our 2012 MG&A expense in corporate to be approximately $135 million. This guidance includes about $35 million of acquisition-related fees and expenses, which we estimate will be less than $5 million in the second half of this year. We now expect full year 2012 underlying corporate interest expense to be approximately $115 million based on current foreign exchange rates and excluding underlying adjustments.","The new debt used to help fund the Central Europe acquisition currently carries a weighted average interest rate of about 3%.","Our 2012 capital spending outlook is approximately $240 million for the full year. This $40 million increase from previous guidance is driven by second half capital spending in Central Europe. Note that this capital spending guidance excludes MillerCoors' capital expenditure. We currently expect annual capital spending in Central Europe to be in the range of EUR 80 million to EUR 90 million for the next 2 years and moderately lower after that.","Over the medium term, we will be focusing on reducing our leverage. However, we remain committed to our existing capital allocation strategy and maintaining a strong dividend for our shareholders.","As far as our cost outlook is concerned, in Canada, for 2012, we are now expecting our all-in cost of goods sold to increase in the high single-digit rate per hectoliter in the local currency, up from mid-single digits on our last earnings call. This increase in forecast is driven by a mix shift towards higher-cost packages and products including Strongbow and Newcastle.","In the U.S., we continue to expect MillerCoors cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a low single-digit rate for the full year of 2012.","In Central Europe, we anticipate a low single-digit increase in pro forma cost of goods sold per hectoliter this year in local currency, driven by agricultural commodities, utilities and fuel inflation.","In the U.K., we now expect our full year cost of goods sold per hectoliter to grow at a high single-digit rate in local currency, driven by input inflation, sales mix, pension costs and onetime expenses related to the U.K. brewery improvement this year. We expect additional pension expense this year of about $15 million in Canada and $10 million in the U.K.","For the balance of the year, we are investing incrementally in our brands and innovation to drive growth in the years ahead. Marketing investments are planned to be higher in Canada, U.K. and International. MillerCoors also plans incremental investments in the U.S. for the balance of the year. In Central Europe, after a double-digit increase in marketing and sales spending behind our innovation agenda in the first half, we plan more moderate local currency increases in the second part of this year.","In other outlook. At current levels, we expect foreign exchange to have a negative impact on second half 2012 profit of approximately $3 million in Canada, entirely driven by the third quarter and approximately $25 million in Central Europe on a pro forma basis, primarily driven by the third quarter.","Also in Canada, in the third quarter, we expect a reversal of the second quarter volume benefit from the timing of the Canada Day holiday. In the fourth quarter, we will cycle the 53rd week in our fiscal 2011 year, which provided approximately $12 million of additional pretax income in Canada last year.","And in the U.K., in the third quarter, we will be cycling a reduction in employee incentive compensation expense last year. This will have a negative impact in our results in the third quarter of about $6 million.","At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for regional outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Peter?","Peter S. Swinburn","Thanks, Gavin. So in Canada, we continue to roll out our Coors Light Iced T and have launched Aluminum Pints for Coors Light and Molson Canadian. We also acquired the license for Newcastle Brown Ale and the Strongbow Cider in Canada and managed the pricing volume mix in the west to better balance our market share performance.","In the U.S., we have strong marketing and sales programming behind our key brands this year in peak season especially for Miller Lite, Coors Light and Miller64. We are also introducing or testing a range of new brands and we continue to leverage a full slate of innovative packaging including the Miller Lite punch top can to help build on existing brands.","In Central Europe, our results were impacted by a negative foreign exchange and upfront investment behind innovations and marketing efforts ahead of the peak season this year from which we expect strong returns in the second half. These innovations include lemon and grapefruit extensions of some of our leading brands. These line extensions and new packages have been growing strongly this summer and are pulling volume from inside the beer category and from other types of beverages. Additionally, following expansion last year, Staropramen is growing strongly in Central Europe and in our export markets. As a result, we are optimistic that our Central Europe trends in local currency will improve in the second half.","In the U.K., we plan to invest in marketing and in our Sharp's Brewery to increase capacity in order to support the strong growth of Doom Bar, which has been the fastest-growing cask ale in the U.K. for the past 3 years. The 2012 investment in our International business will be moderately higher than last year.","Finally, the following are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the third quarter. In Canada, our sales-to-retail for the first 4 weeks of the quarter declined at a mid-single-digit range versus 2011 and this was related to the year-over-year shift of the Canada Day holiday. In the U.S., for the 4 weeks ended July 28, STRs were in line with the prior year. In Central Europe, our sales volumes increased to the high single-digit range for the first month of the quarter. And in on the first 4 weeks of the quarter, our U.K. STRs decreased at a mid-single-digit rate. In the first 4 weeks, our International STRs have increased at a low double-digit rate. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.","So to summarize our discussions today. We've completed an important acquisition that we expect to strengthen our company, enhance our growth profile and increase shareholder value in a relatively short time frame. Increased net sales and NSR per hectoliter on an apples-to-apples basis on solid pricing and we sustained moderate gross margin compression, which we are addressing. We also continue to invest in our key brands and innovation across the business, and most important, on an underlying basis, we grew operating margins, earning per share and free cash flow in the quarter. The markets in which we operate remain tough, but we are taking and will continue to take aggressive steps to drive long-term value for our shareholders.","Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. And also as usual at 2 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. That call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.","So at this point, Martina, we would like to open it up to -- for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So first, just on the Central Europe because obviously it's the first time we're seeing the pro forma results here. So if I just look at the profit weakness in 2Q, it sounds like the -- it really came a lot from the COGS inflation being much higher. So can you just walk us through in terms of what the -- how much of that was kind of industry-wide issue? And based on your comment, it sounds like you're expecting the COGS per hectoliter to improve in the back half? Why are you expecting that to happen? And then some of the negative geographic and channel mix that you've talked about in 2Q, if you can just go through that in a little bit more detail?","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes, I'll let Mark take you through the detail, Judy. But I think, really, as far as our perspective on the business that we've acquired and what we've seen of it, everything that's happened is either due to strategic business decisions which we support, which will be -- which will give us a good solid foundation for the second half of the year and\/or just stuff that's happened in the market regarding weather, which is being quite difficult but that was in the first quarter. So Mark, do you want to take us through a bit more detail?","Mark Hunter","Sure. Really -- let me give you a little bit of context then talk about the specific on COGS. So I think what we've seen in the business has been very impressive and very much in line with our expectations around the quality of the people, the brands, the focus and execution and the discipline and leanness of the business. And certainly, in the first half of the year, following a very, very soft February driven by very poor weather across Central Europe, the business decision to invest aggressively ahead of the peak selling season, so we've seen a significant increase in sales and marketing investment, significant increase in innovation and we've invested more heavily in customer relationships and customer trading and that certainly helped drive momentum in the business. As you heard Peter and Gavin mentioned, we've seen a high single-digit volume growth through July and that's, as you know, our peak selling season so I think those decisions have been well placed. As we've got to the end of the first half, volume run ahead of the market. Our market share is up. Our pricing is up. So for the first half, pricing is up by about 5% and that's more than compensating for any mix or discount activity in the marketplace. And then to your final point, COGS clearly have moved along kind of a high single-digit level in the first half. And to be fair, none of that is MCCE-specific. Most of it is industry-wide challenges around input cost inflation on things like malt, energy and fuel. So I don't think we're not seeing anything unusual in our COGS numbers. As we look to this -- towards the second half, we will be lapping some one-off costs associated with packaging changes and bottle changes in the second half of last year and that will have a dampening effect on COGS as we move through the second half of the year. So that's why we're confident that a high single-digit number will certainly come back through the second half of the year.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just following up on that, Mark. Maybe can you give us some comfort around why you think that, that sort of the strategic investment step-up that you saw in 2Q was really just a one quarter situation that we're not going to continue to see sort of higher investment needed to drive better sales growth going forward? And then, it sounds like your comment about the business or the acquisition being accretive in the first year. So if you can just help us maybe quantify how much accretion you're assuming for 2013? And what are some of the assumptions that you have in your forecast to kind of get to that accretion number?","Mark Hunter","Well, I can certainly pick up the first part of the question and I'll ask Gavin or Peter to pick up the second part. With regard to the investments in the business, I mean, the industry in Central Europe in the first quarter was down over 3% in volume terms. And I think the leadership team here took a decision, which was do we either start trimming back on investment to deal with that volume softness or do we pool some of our investment from the second half towards the first half. That's a decision that was made and I believe it to be the right decision. So it's been very much a change in phasing of investment from second half to first half across sales and marketing and innovation and that's starting to pay dividends, a lot of the volume trends improvement that was seen through July. I think we said at the time of acquisition, we do see opportunities over the medium term to move the sales and marketing investment up, but what we've done is very much in the context of ensuring that the bottom line of our P&L moves in the right direction. So there are clearly opportunities on a market-by-market basis to further strengthen our position and we'll be taking those, but we will do that in the normal course of business. So I think you can look on the sales and marketing investment this year very much as a re-phasing of that spend for the right reasons. With regard to the accretion, Gavin or Peter, do you want to pick that up?","Gavin Hattersley","Yes, that's fine. Thanks, Mark. Look, Judy, we're not going to give earnings per share guidance or accretion numbers. What we have given you is our pro forma numbers and we've tried to give you some flavor around what's impacting those pro forma numbers going back and going forward. So that's as far as we can go on that question, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my last question, just on Canada. So you had a pretty big step-up in terms of marketing spending in the quarter. It sounds like the share is still down a bit kind of on a year-over-year and then I don't know if the industry number has also weakened in the July, but July being down mid-single digits in terms of sales-to-retailer growth for Canada just also seems a little bit weaker. So Dave, maybe you can tell us kind of what you're seeing from a competitive environment and why don't you -- do you think that some of the investment that you're making is actually driving better share performance?","David Dunnewald","Yes. Thanks, Judy. Let me take you through the shape of our share results in Q2. Let me start by brand. First of all, Coors Light trademark was up double digits. We had really strong trial on Iced T and the interesting thing is despite the strong trial, we saw the Coors Light brand, itself, up mid-single digits. So didn't seem to be any cannibalization on the surface there. If anything, there was a bit of a halo for the brand. So really pleased with what we saw in the Coors Light trademark. Obviously, the Iced T is at a premium price, as you know, so it would have had a premiumization effect for us. Canadian was up low-single digits and our above premium brands were strong for us through the quarter. Crafts were up double digits. Our domestic above premium, which would largely be Rickard's was up mid-single digit and the imports were up low single digit. Innovation in total, and remember that the step-up in our marketing investment would come into play here, was between 3 and 3.5 point. And again, with the premiumization effect from Iced T and from the growth of Molson Canadian is 67. What we saw in the quarter was something similar to Q1. Our share challenge was in Western Canada. That's where we lost share. What we did see in the quarter is better trends on our core brands, so Canadian and Coors Light. But we saw worsening trends in the value segment. And I think when you look at the mix of what's happened, that helps you understand why we had a very positive NSR result for the quarter. So where we were feeling the pain was really at the bottom end of the market, and premium and above doing very well for us. In terms of the competitive environment, I'd say very competitive market across the country both in terms of price and innovation. So we saw an awful lot of activity in the market. There was more beer that would have been sold on promotion than in prior quarters. I'd characterize the West as the most active market, but I think there was a step-up in Qu\u00e9bec as well that we saw. And despite that, we're really pleased with what we saw on our NSR per hectoliter where we're up about 3.3%. So we're not blindly chasing volume or share. We're making the right decisions, I think, to get the balance between value and volume. Does that help?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from UBS.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I want to follow up a little bit on the profit declines at StarBev. There was only, I guess, 2 weeks in your reported numbers. It sounds like some of the marketing decisions were tactical decisions, but that's a short period of time for such a big -- what sounds like a big swing in the strategy. So can you help maybe give some context on how big of an impact each one of these things had on the decline in profitability?","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes, just for clarity, the decline in profitability that we're talking about on a pro forma basis is for the first 6 months, not just for the 2 weeks. We only had the business for 2 weeks. And during that period of time, the business has performed absolutely in line with our expectations. So the main drivers, by far, are the ones that Mark has talked to. There's FX in that. There was very poor weather in February where literally accounts were closed and they couldn't deliver beer, which significantly affected the profits in that particular month. And also the decisions, the strategic decisions, that the team made locally to put money behind the brands in advance of the peak season and that has -- that's really been a, if you like, a movement of funding from the second half of the year into the first half of the year. But over the full year, the marketing expenditure will be much in line with what we expected.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, got it. And if maybe we could talk about Romania a little bit. I believe that's your largest market of all the new countries and it's been a market where the market share over the last couple of years has declined quite a bit. Is the marketing step-up getting allocated to a particular division? And how do you see your share trends progressing in Romania?","Peter S. Swinburn","Well, again, I'll let Mark talk specifically about Romania. It's not our biggest market, either in volume or in profit terms. But Mark, you want to pick it up?","Mark Hunter","Yes. So, I mean, just to be clear, if you look at total industry volume and Romania clearly kind of leads the pack across Central Europe, we have a #3 position there. And my sense is as we conducted a current planning process, that we are growing in confidence with our ability to move that business forward. Now it won't be in 12 months, but I believe over the next 36 months we can, with the strength of our brand portfolio, expect to see an appropriate level of increased marketing spend, a broader commercial spend to be fair on an improvement in both our share trends and our bottom line performance. So if you look back over the last 3 to 5 years, this was a far, far more profitable and a larger market for the Central European business. My view is that we can regain a material proportion of that over the course of the next 3 years, but clearly beyond that, I'm not going to offer any detail at this stage.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And if I could ask one financial question. You alluded to the focus on paying down debt. What would be your -- the target ratios that you want to hit before it would be appropriate to just begin considering a buyback again?","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks, Kaumil. What we're trying to do -- it's Gavin here, what we're trying to do is get back to our pre-acquisition ratios that we had in place. And as we said at the time of acquisition, we would expect that to be in the next 2 to 3 years' time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On -- I guess, Mark or Malcolm, it actually sounds like on a local currency basis -- this is also on StarBev, you expect things to actually improve quite a bit here in the second half. You've got pricing that has been positive. You've got volumes accelerating. Sounds like cost of sales per hectoliter decelerating. You said marketing spend is shifting from 2H or has shifted from 2H into 1H. Are you -- I guess, is that a fair understanding and it sounds like it actually translates into an expectation of EBITDA growth, local currency for StarBev in the second half.","Peter S. Swinburn","Mark, I think you picked up all the data points accurately.","Mark Hunter","Yes, I think that's a very fair summary.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And when you said pricing up 5% for StarBev in the first half, was that inclusive of mix -- I think it was local currency, but can you speak to net sales per hectoliter inclusive of mix?","Mark Hunter","Yes, in the second quarter, unit pricing was up 5% and then mix and discount activity that took about 3% of that, so it gave us a net position of about 2% growth in the second quarter. And that's pretty similar for the first half in total.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, similar. Okay, great. And then finally, if we try to tease out FX in the first half, can you give you us some sense of what EBITDA did in terms of rate of decline or maybe gross profit, some metric. We're trying to tease out the underlying business performance in the first half?","Gavin Hattersley","Mark, this is Gavin here. From a second point of view in Central Europe, about 1\/3 of that decline was related to FX, a little over $9 million.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got it. And the EBITDA -- and that's at the EBITDA line?","Gavin Hattersley","Yes.","Mark Hunter","And Mark, just to clarify that. That $9 million is at the operating income level. The FX impact on EBITDA is actually more significant than that.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you give us some magnitude difference?","Mark Hunter","Yes, so it's probably about $15 million impact at the EBITDA line and about $9 million at the operating income line.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got it. And these are -- both those numbers are translation?","Mark Hunter","Yes, that's correct.","David Dunnewald","And Mark, this is Dave Dunnewald. For a clarification or just looking at the relative size of the -- going from operating to EBITDA, if you look at the size of the depreciation and amortization, you'll see the kind of ratio that Mark just alluded to when he gave you those numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a follow-up on Mark's question. In terms of FX, what was the effect on -- well, I guess, first, in terms of the outlook you gave, the $25 million impact in the second half, is that on operating income or on EBITDA?","Peter S. Swinburn","It's on pretax, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Pretax profit?","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, what was the effect in the first quarter?","Peter S. Swinburn","It was pretty flat at a pretax level, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then in terms of your outlook for the year, just on FX, there's no -- is that a fixed -- have you done anything to hedge foreign currency at all, or is there a chance that the number would float around with exchange rates?","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes. The number that we gave you was based on current exchange rate, Bryan. So if anything happens to the exchange rate going forward, it would obviously impact that outlook.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess when you look at, I think, some of the reaction today to the pro forma, I suspect that there is some -- still some lingering question about kind of the ongoing margins and whether or not they're sustainable. And I think part of it is foreign exchange has had a pretty significant negative effect on the translated number, so I think that's one thing. The second is, and I'd like to get your insight into this, just how much -- is there any purchase accounting or any other accounting adjustments that have been made that would be negatively affecting it? And then finally, just in terms of kind of where we stand today on margins, just what -- why you think that this is a good base and a base to grow off of?","Gavin Hattersley","Maybe I'll take the purchase accounting question quickly, Bryan. The purchase accounting had a very minimal impact on our EBITDA and our EBITDA pretax numbers. In fact, the numbers that were announced at the time of the deal, the numbers that were showing down the pro forma are very similar. There's very little difference between the two.","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes, and Bryan, as I sort of highlighted in the script, we've had a chance to look at this business. We can see the structure of the business both in terms of the top line, in terms of the pricing and the margins that are being driven out there plus the cost structure and any likely increased costs that we might have in terms of running the business plus the capital structure that we think we're going to need going forward. And really, as I said in the script, we are very confident of the EBITDA margins. Our local currency are sustainable. We also believe that the initial chore that we made on the business in terms of what we thought we'd have to spend in capital was over ragged and so we -- our capital expenditure going forward is less than we expected. And we also expect to drive up the synergies. So we're very confident on all of those 3 points. And on a much broader basis, I have to say we're very pleased with the business that we bought and we're very confident that we'll hit the sort of return rates that we talked about at the very early part of the 3 to 5 years that we've always outlined.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could follow up. It sounds like February had a pretty negative effect on the first quarter. And can you just talk about how volatile or how this business is affected by weather. Is it any more weather-sensitive, I guess, relative to your core businesses or was the weather just so extreme that it had that type of effect?","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes, the weather was so extreme. The business closed down and even with the rain in the U.K., we never got to that level, so that's -- it's was just a -- I wouldn't say it's a one-off but it was very extreme weather.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one final question. There was a -- in the quarter, you had some write-downs in China. Can you just talk a little bit more about what drove that and if there's anything that we'd anticipate going forward in that regard?","Krishnan Anand","Well, this is Kandy, Bryan. In our International business, as you know, it's been growing strong top line, putting 30% in the quarter, specifically the China. Our performance has been below expectations since the inception of the JV, led with the challenges by joint venture partner. As a result, they did the testing and wrote off the entire goodwill related to the joint venture in this quarter. We have an agreement to buy out the minority interest of our joint venture partner this quarter. However, due to developments, we think closing of that agreement is challenged, and therefore, we are, at this point of time, looking at other alternatives for that investment.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So you're needing a different partner there?","Krishnan Anand","We're looking at all the alternatives at this time, Bryan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Watson from HSBC.","James C. Watson - HSBC, Research Division","First question, just wanted to go on StarBev, the kind of marketing that you were pulling forward. I was just curious why -- what you were so confident in, in the first half having kind of just been able to take over this business that you wanted to -- that you wanted to pull forward if there were certain great opportunities that you saw or certain things that you felt were just so obvious, certain brands or things that you wanted to pull that forward as opposed to kind of waiting to own the business a little longer before phasing in the marketing that way?","Peter S. Swinburn","James, we probably need make this a bit clearer. We didn't make those decisions. Those decisions were made by the previous management. So we deflected -- and they're reflected in the pro forma results. As I already point out, we only had the business for a couple of weeks. So we did not make those decisions. They were made previously.","James C. Watson - HSBC, Research Division","And then I'll just go further. In terms of your marketing, do you see any big opportunities when you look at certain brands, certain regions that perhaps having done more due diligence in the last -- since our last conversation that you'd like to talk about?","Peter S. Swinburn","Well, yes. I think that the -- as we said, we've got very strong positions in most of the markets. The team has done a very good job on innovation in terms of line extensions, making new flavors. And a lot of investment that went on in the first half was behind that innovation. And as Mark said, that's really, excuse the term, that's bearing fruit now. The other part of it would be that Staropramen was extended into most of the markets last year and early this year. Investments gone behind that brand and that brand's performing exceptionally well. That's a mixed play because it indexes at around 110, 115 compared to most of our core brands, so that's growing at strong double digits so we're pleased about that. And looking forward, we're currently examining the year and researching the possibility of expanding the Carling brand into some of the markets, but we haven't yet matched the product nor do we have the consumer research back yet. But they would be the 3 main areas I'd highlight.","James C. Watson - HSBC, Research Division","Okay. And Staropramen at 110 or 115, I was just wondering how big of a premium segment do a lot of these markets have built out and if you were to bring Carling in, would that be kind of squarely within an International premium segment?","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes. The premium or the above premium, whichever sector we're talking about, they're both mainstream category in all of these markets is pretty limited and so that's an opportunity going forward. And as we -- as GDP grows in these markets, we would expect that sector to -- or that category, sorry, to increase as a percentage of the overall business. Carling will be -- again, we haven't done a consumer research so we can't tell you what exactly what the index would be, but it would certainly be above the average.","James C. Watson - HSBC, Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly on Canada. Looking at your main competitor there, they also seem to lose share in the second quarter. So I was just wondering where the competitive pressure is. Is this coming from in -- Canada? And if it's coming from smaller brewers or from retailers pushing pricing. How long that can last if that's going to spill over to the mainstream from the value brands?","Peter S. Swinburn","Again, I'll let Dave go into detail, but you've got it right. It has to do with smaller brewers in the value sector that they're the ones who are picking up the share in general. But Dave, do you have any more specifics?","David Dunnewald","No. I mean it's a long-standing trend where we've seen the smaller national and regional brewers playing hard in the value segment and picking up share there. It's the reason that we've done things like the introduction of Keystone a couple of years ago and working hard on our position with it in the value segment. It's a very, very fragmented segment. The competitive set is different in each region and so it takes some finesse to compete in that segment and the work that we have going on, but it is an ongoing trend that we face.","James C. Watson - HSBC, Research Division","Did the pricing pressure from -- within value spill over to mainstream and all? Is the gap between value and mainstream kind of staying where you want it to stay?","David Dunnewald","Yes, the gap is larger in the West, frankly, than where I'd like to see it. I mean, you have some provinces where value index is as low as a 53, but generally, in the major markets across the country, the gap is manageable. But you will get the exception in a couple of the Western markets where the gaps are large enough that it certainly spills into the mainstream.","Operator","You have a follow-up from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Again, Mark, I wanted to try to understand a little bit better what's going on with the mix in StarBev and how you think about the stickiness of volume as you move into next year. On the mix side, you're getting -- you're netting out a positive net sales per hectoliter. Are these incremental products you're putting more emphasis on? Are they gross margin-enhancing? Are they gross margin-degrading? And then, how do you think about the stickiness of this volume lift? What -- I really don't understand what's driving it in terms of products or channels. You're spending -- or the prior management decided to up spending in the second quarter, but I'm not sure where that money is going against and whether it's sustained volume lift.","Mark Hunter","Okay, I mean, there's a number of question in there, Mark, so let me try and kind of pick my way through them. The orientation of the business is really from a portfolio perspective to drive everything we can at core, which is our mainstream brands or above and everything we're doing from an innovation perspective should be margin enhancing versus our average margins, so that really is the focus of the commercial team. And the bulk of incremental investment in sales and marketing in the first half or really the second quarter has gone principally behind innovation agenda and our core brands, so you've got to remember we currently got the #1 brand in 4 markets and we're strong #2 or #3 in the other markets. So investing in our core brand, not dissimilar to Coors Light investment in the U.S. or Canadian Coors Light investment in Canada or Carling in the U.K., that remains absolutely central to our thinking. So we're looking to continue to strengthen the backbone of our business through marketing and orientate the business to top line and value growth on the back of the premiumizing the portfolio with a big chunk of that being driven by our innovation agenda. The mix that we refer to is a combination of things that's a shift in some of the dynamic in our customer mix, but we're seeing some shift from our traditional trade to what's called key accounts here or you'd recognize as the grocery channel. And a little bit of mix on packaging types as well as we move from some returnable bottles into more nonreturnable packaging, things like PET in some of the markets. So below the top line, there's a combination of different factors going on and our job is obviously to manage that holistically and make sure that the total number moves in the right direction and that's what the team generally have been doing and continue to do.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And so it sounds like the objective is mix enhancement. But because of the channel mix and because of the package mix, there's been a little bit of a mix degrade, is that a fair assumption? And how do you think about lapping these volumes benefits? I know it's very early days, but how do you think about that?","Mark Hunter","Well, I'd probably characterize the challenge much more as more general top line growth. So a combination of both pricing, volume and mix all being managed effectively. And the good news is that if you look at overall industry trends, the likelihood of a stronger industry growth than we've seen in other markets is higher because of the economic growth that we have seen here from a GDP perspective. And even against the broader eurozone, we expect GDP growth to be at least twice that we'll see across the broader eurozone and correlation between GDP growth and industry beer volume growth is very strong. So I have relatively high degree of confidence as long as the economic situation doesn't take a dramatic turn for the worst, that the volume growth should come through in the business and if we can continue to manage pricing and mix, as the team have been doing, and drive innovation agenda, maintaining and developing the margins and our local currency level should be well within our capabilities.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper from Consumer's Edge Research.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","A couple of questions. It would be helpful if we could get the 8% increase in SG&A in the Central and Eastern European business, how much of that was a pull forward, I guess, versus just sort of underlying growth in the quarter? And then the second one would be in Canada, how much did the shift of Canada Day impact volumes?","David Dunnewald","Do you want me to take Canada first, probably simpler? Our estimate for the quarter is that it was about 2%, a 2% impact on volume.","Mark Hunter","Yes, can you just repeat the 8% referring to?","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","So I think you said in local currency, MG&A was up 8% in Central and Eastern Europe. We've obviously talked a lot about that being pulled forward or I guess marketing expenses being pulled forward for the second half. I just was trying to understand what the, if you will, the underlying or x that pull forward increase was just so that we can understand what the underlying growth in MG&A would have been or might be as we think about this going forward?","Mark Hunter","Well, let me talk specifically about sales and marketing. So on a full year basis, we would expect our sales and marketing to be relatively flat year-on-year, so that's probably the best indication I can give you of the difference in phasing that's taken place in our investment. So on a total year basis, we're currently projecting sales and marketing investment to be generally flat. So you'll need to work back from there how much of that flowed through as incremental in the first half. I don't have that specific number in front of me.","David Dunnewald","Brett, to be sure, that's in local currency that Mark is talking about.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Yes.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the presenters.","Peter S. Swinburn","Okay. Thank you, Martina, and thank you, everybody, for taking part this morning or this afternoon. We really welcome the interest, and look forward to speaking to you at the next quarter's announcement. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Before we begin, I will paraphrase the company's Safe Harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections.","The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.","Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time-to-time by the company's executives in discussing the company's performance, please visit the company's website www.molsoncoors.com and click on the financial reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results.","Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior-year period and in U.S. dollars.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Connor. Hello and welcome everybody to the Molson Coors earnings call. And thanks for joining us today.","With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have: Gavin Hattersley, the CEO of MillerCoors; Stewart Glendinning, our CEO in Canada; Simon Cox, our European CEO; Kandy Anand, the CEO of our International Business; Sam Walker, our Global Chief People and Legal Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller; Dave Dunnewald, VP of Investor Relations; and David Heede, who has very ably filled the role of Interim Global CFO for the past six months, as we've completed our search for a permanent CFO. David is now transitioning back to his role as our Europe CFO as we welcome our new Global CFO, Mauricio Restrepo, who joined Molson Coors yesterday and he is here with us this morning.","And for our earnings call today, David and I will take you through highlights of our first quarter 2016 results for the Molson Coors Brewing Company along with some perspectives on the balance of 2016.","In the first quarter, we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positionings through incremental marketing investments, and continuing to premiumize our portfolio.","We began to see the benefits flow to our top-line performance as we grew worldwide volume, improved core brand momentum in key markets, introduced fast-growing innovations in all of our businesses, and achieved Above Premium growth globally including in craft, flavored malt beverages and cider. We also significantly expanded gross, operating, and pre-tax margins globally and increased total company underlying after-tax earnings more than 28%, while growing underlying EBITDA more than 15% versus a year ago.","At the same time, we completed a common stock offering in January to fund about 20% of the pending MillerCoors transaction. And we made solid progress in our planning for the integration of MillerCoors and the Miller global brand portfolio. Completion of this game-changing transaction is still expected in the second half of this year and we intend to be ready to go on day one following the close.","In brands, Coors Light grew volume 3.5% globally including strong double-digit growth in the U.K. and Ireland and high-single-digit growth in Latin America. In Above Premium, our craft portfolio drove growth from Doom Bar and the broader Sharp's portfolio in the U.K., Creemore and Granville Island in Canada, Blue Moon Belgian White in the U.S., and in the U.K., and its sister brand Belgian Moon in Canada, and also the newly acquired Saint Archer in the U.S.","In ciders, we grew volume of Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. And in flavored malt beverages, introduction of Henry's Hard Soda is proceeding well ahead of expectations and driving incremental Above Premium volume for us in the U.S.","We continued to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, we increased efficiency of our operations, and we implemented common global systems. To ensure that our supply chain is fit for future, we completed the sale of our Vancouver Brewery in Canada for C$185 million and we'll lease the brewery back from the buyer as we build a new, more efficient, and flexible brewery. We also gained agreement to the closure of Burton South Brewery in the U.K., allowing us to further consolidate U.K. brewing operations.","Regional highlights for the first quarter are as follows: In the U.S., underlying equity income increased 22.1% from a year ago, driven by higher net pricing, positive sales mix, timing of shipments and lower cost of goods sold. Coors Light and Miller Lite each gained share of the U.S. Premium Light segment for the fourth consecutive quarter, with both brands achieving flat sales to retail volume for the first time in MillerCoors' history.","Improved momentum for these two brands was driven by ongoing improvements to their consumer communications, which appeals to a broad cross-section of men and women, Millennials, and multi-cultural consumers. Coors Banquet remains only national premium beer in the category that continues to grow. In the higher margin Above Premium segment, our lead craft brand, Blue Moon Belgian White, delivered another quarter of growth, as did Leinenkugel's Grapefruit Shandy and our newly acquired Saint Archer brands.","In FMBs, we achieved strong initial results from the introduction of Henry's Hard Sodas in the first quarter. And according to Nielsen, Henry's Hard Orange Soda has the best velocity of any hard soda since the fourth week of its launch, and Henry's Hard Ginger Ale Soda is the number one Ginger Ale in this fast growing segment.","In Canada, we delivered strong earnings growth, but our top-line performance was lower in both volume and revenue per hectoliter. In brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian both had a challenging quarter, and we're taking additional concrete steps to improve performance in the balance of the year, which I'll discuss in a few minutes.","In Above Premium and craft, Coors Banquet, Belgian Moon, Mad Jack Apple Lager, Heineken and Strongbow Cider all grew volume and share in the quarter along with our Creemore and Granville craft brands.","In headline financial results for the quarter, Canada underlying pre-tax income increased 25.2% in constant currency, primarily due to a timing-led reduction in distribution costs, some lower pension expenses, and results of our ongoing cost savings initiatives.","These factors were partially offset by the impact of lower volume and higher brand investments. Excluding the impact of the loss of the Miller brands, Canada STRs declined 1.6%, but including the Miller brands, STRs declined 5.2%. Increased competitor trade spend and pricing activities, especially in Qu\u00e9bec and the West region, led to overall softer volume.","In Europe, earnings were lower in the quarter primarily due to higher brand investments and amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and the termination of the Heineken contract brewing arrangement in the U.K. Notwithstanding, our business and our brands performed well across the region.","We increased market share and we continue to premiumize our portfolio and reduce costs. We grew volume in seven of the 11 countries and for seven of our lead core and premium brands in the region. In core brands, Carling, Bergenbier, and O\u017eujsko grew share of segment in their primary markets.","Our Above Premium portfolio increased momentum with strong double-digit growth by Coors Light and the craft portfolio, including Doom Bar and the other Sharp's brands.","Additionally, our cider portfolio achieved strong growth with the inclusion of Rekorderlig since the middle of 2015. And the full repatriation of the Staropramen brand in the U.K. also added to the solid progress we made in premiumizing our Europe portfolio.","Our International business improved pre-tax performance in the first quarter, driven by continued volume growth in Latin America, India, and Japan, as well as lower marketing and overhead expenses due to the substantial restructure of our China business last year. Coors Light grew at a high-single-digit rate in international markets due to our launch in Colombia, as well as growth in our existing Latin America markets.","Now I'll turn over to David to give first quarter financial highlights and perspective on the balance of 2016. David?","David Heede - Chief Financial Officer-Europe Region","Thank you, Mark, and hello everybody. Our first quarter financial headlines are as follows.","Headline net sales increased 0.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by 1.2% growth in worldwide volume. Including foreign currency movements, net sales were down approximately 6% in U.S. dollars.","Our net sales per hectoliter decreased 1.9% in constant currency, due to negative mix in Canada and lower Heineken contract brewing volume in Europe.","Underlying after-tax income increased 28.1% to a $110.3 million or $0.54 per share driven by worldwide volume growth and lower cost of goods sold.","On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $159.3 million, which is nearly double the prior year result. In addition to the factors that drove higher underlying income, this increase was primarily due to $110.4 million gain on the sale of our Vancouver brewery at the end of the first quarter, partially offset by special charges related to brewery closures. Please note that we received the cash from the Vancouver brewery sale on the first day of the second quarter.","Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $263.4 million, a 15.2% increase from a year ago.","We issued 29.9 million shares Class B common stock from our equity offering in January for approximately $2.5 billion of net proceeds, which will fund about 20% of the $12 billion pending MillerCoors transaction.","Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of business unit financial results in the quarter.","Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $3 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.6 billion, resulting in a net debt of just over $400 million, which is significantly lower than prior year due to the proceeds received from our equity offering earlier this year.","Looking forward to the remainder of 2016, our strong first quarter results were aided by the timing of Easter holiday and the additional days sales as a result of 2016 being the leap year, along with relatively favorable cost comparisons in the U.S. and lower Canada distribution costs.","We anticipate that our results will not benefit from most of these factors in the balance of this year. Other trends to consider over the last three quarters of this year include: higher investments in our brands this year, including a double-digit increase globally in the second quarter, leading into peak season in the U.S., Canada, and Europe; incremental Europe brand amortization expense with an annualized impact of approximately $15 million, which began in the fourth quarter of 2015 along with lower net pension benefit in Europe this year; a total prohibition on the sale of alcohol, unexpectedly implemented by the state government in Bihar, India, in early April.","We don't know how long this ban will be in place and we expect this development to present a headwind for our International business until it is resolved, as this is our largest state of operation in India. Note, however, that this prohibition in Bihar has no impact on the Mount Shivalik business in India that we purchased last year; the impact of terminated contracts which are now nearly all behind this; and finally, foreign currency translation, which, at current exchange rates, would not be a significant factor in our underlying pre-tax results this year. This view has improved significantly since our February earnings call, because of the recent strengthening of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. Given the recent volatility of key foreign currencies, however, it is important to watch these rates closely.","Regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following metrics exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction, the timing of which will have a big impact on virtually all guidance measures. For the full year, we expect cash contributions to our defined pension funds to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 million, including a 42% of MillerCoors contributions and expense; capital spending of approximately $300 million; MG&A expense in corporate of approximately $120 million as we invest more behind innovation and commercial excellence this year; consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million; and underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits, or adjustments to uncertain tax provisions.","Regarding free cash flow guidance, we still have a large number of dynamic factors in play in relation to cash use and capital deployment, principally due to the pending MillerCoors transaction and, therefore, we plan to issue 2016 underlying free cash flow guidance later in the year with the goal of removing some of the recent volatility to guidance that has occurred.","As far as cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe in local currency to increase at low-single-digit rate for the full year 2016; we now expect 2016 MillerCoors COGS per hectoliter to be approximately in line with prior year; lower than expected pricing for diesel, aluminum, and corn, as well as acceleration in some of our cost savings initiatives drove the change from previous guidance of up low-single-digits; we now expect our International COGS per hectoliter in local currency to increase at the high-single-digit rate for 2016. This is up from low-single-digits previously due to geographic mix changes; we continue to expect cost savings for the next two years to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million. This view excludes cost savings from MillerCoors, as well as synergies resulting from the pending MillerCoors acquisition, which we expect to be $200 million by the year four following the transaction close.","Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of businesses early in the second quarter, which are impacted by the early timing of Easter this year. In the U.S. and Canada, for the three weeks through April 23, sales to retail decreased at mid-single-digit rates. In Europe, volume through to April 25 decreased low-single-digits. And our International sales volume, including royalty volume, through to April 23 decreased at a double-digit rate, partially due to the alcohol prohibition in Bihar, India.","As ever, please keep in mind, these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead. Also note that, following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we plan to discontinue providing early next quarter volumes.","At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap up and the Q&A. Mark?","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David. In 2016, we will continue to drive our First Choice for consumer and customer agenda in the geographies and segments where we choose to play. As we move into peak season this year, we're seeing additional competitive pricing pressure and we intend to step-up our brand investments significantly, particularly in the second quarter. In the U.S., there has been a great deal of change in MillerCoors over the past 10 months. Those changes were necessary to create the foundation for the volume growth we aim to achieve by 2019.","As we work to close the transaction, MillerCoors remains disciplined, decisive, and accountable for growing the business, transforming its portfolio, and driving value for our shareholders. In American Light Lagers, we continued to gain momentum behind the revitalization of our two largest U.S. brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite. In Above Premium, we continue to develop higher-margin offerings that can scale and stick, including strong early results from the launch of Henry's Hard Orange and Ginger Ale Sodas and we'll introduce a cherry cola flavor later this year.","We've also made the decision to offer our fastest-growing Leinenkugel's extension, Grapefruit Shandy, on a year-round basis to strengthen the Leinenkugel's brand family, which alongside Blue Moon Belgian White forms the base of a formidable craft portfolio. In cider, we're broadening the appeal of Smith & Forge Hard Cider by adding a bottle package to our lineup.","We'll continue to build First Choice customer partnerships with our Building with Beer retail strategy, which leverages the higher velocity and broad appeal of American Light Lagers. We plan to expand this valuable tool beyond the on-premise to additional channels in the balance of this year.","In Canada, the restructuring of our brand portfolio was largely complete and gaining traction. In the first quarter, we achieved strong volume growth behind both Coors Banquet and Pilsner. We also continue to see strong momentum for our craft brands, Creemore and Granville Island, as well as in our Mexican portfolio with Sol and Dos Equis and in flavored malt beverages with Mad Jack.","At the end of the quarter, we launched Mad Jack Root Beer and Ginger Ale, the first major hard soda entries in Canada. We continue to focus on accelerating growth for our core brands Coors Light and Molson Canadian as our biggest opportunity and challenge. Coors Light brand health has improved behind our North American packaging update, which continued to roll out in the first quarter, along with high impact retail executions that drove positive momentum in social engagement.","For Molson Canadian, following another successful #anythingforhockey campaign in the first quarter, we'll continue in peak season with strong programming and new communications that celebrates all of the rich qualities of our beer and our Canadian identity.","Operationally, we continue on our mission to be First Choice for consumers and customers focusing on our Field Sales Management program to deliver brilliant store-level execution across space, assortment, and pricing.","In 2016, we will also continue to restructure our supply chain to ensure we are fit for the future. The sale of our Vancouver brewery for C$185 million at the end of the first quarter was a significant first step towards allowing us to build a more efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years.","In Europe, we achieved solid top-line performance in the first quarter on the strength of our core brands and the addition of the Rekorderlig cider and Staropramen brands in the U.K. Although, the increased brand amortization expense will present a headwind for the next couple of quarters, we will continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across Europe to grow share of segment. In fact, earlier today, we announced the signing of a global Carling sponsorship as the official beer partner of the English Premier League. This sponsorship reaches well beyond Carling in the U.K., as it allows us to leverage any brand in any market with one of the most popular sports properties globally.","We'll also continue to premiumize our portfolio with Coors Light, the Sharp's portfolio led by Doom Bar, Ireland's leading craft brand, Franciscan Well, Cobra, Rekorderlig, and Staropramen. And to ensure that our supply chain is fit for future, the planned closure of our Burton South Brewery in the U.K. is progressing well, along with the transition of production to our recently modernized Burton North Brewery by the end of 2017.","Our International business is focused on attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant currency basis versus 2013 foreign exchange rates when we originally made this commitment, and continue to accelerate our overall growth in existing and select new markets.","Upon closing of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction, we will integrate the Miller international brands into our portfolio and leverage a footprint that complements our growth strategy, and allows us to gain entrance into high priority markets, while increasing our business scale in current markets.","We also intend to continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light in Latin America, including the high potential Colombia market, where we launched at the end of last year. Going forward, we expect the Coors, Miller, and Staropramen brands to form the backbone of our international portfolio. In India, we will continue to add scale through our Mount Shivalik business, which we acquired last year as we developed contingency plans related to the Bihar alcohol prohibition.","To wrap up, in the balance of 2016, we'll continue to focus on our First Choice for consumers and customer \u2013 customer's ambition all driven through our PACC lens and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns.","Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference with a couple of hours this afternoon. Also 1:00 P.M. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.","Additionally, in the next two months, we hope to see many of you at two events. Firstly, we will hold our Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Wednesday May 25, 2016 here in Denver. And second, we'll host our Annual New York Investor and Analyst Day at New York Exchange on the afternoon of Wednesday, June 8, 2016.","Finally, I want to offer a thank you to David Heede, who has capably led the finance function over the past almost six months.","So, at this point, Connor, we'd like to open up for questions, please. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So, I was hoping we could dig in on Canada a little bit. Two questions please. The first on the negative mix shift, and how we should think about that evolving, because clearly you are having a fair amount of success at the Above Premium price points where you're putting some notable investment, so kind of the offset there and how we think about that evolving. On the earlier call, we discussed a little bit with Gavin, the outlook for U.S. beer and perhaps that U.S beer would not lose share in the U.S. relative to other competitive alcoholic beverage categories. So, if you could put in that context, that would be helpful. That's my first question on Canada. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, I'll pass across to Stewart. Stewart, do you want to set that question just in the context of the kind of transformational agenda that you're leading for in Canada.","Stewart F. Glendinning - President & Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, cheers. Thanks for that, Vivien. Well, look, I think if you look at where we've been going with our portfolio, our focus has been on developing the top end and we're really pleased with the way that the Above Premium brands are gaining share in the marketplace. If you look at our NSR in total, the underlying increase in NSR is close to about 1%, and the mix that we're talking about is really being driven by two items; one is the loss of Miller and the other is the impact of our contract brewing revenues which impact the top line, but don't impact the volume. So, I would focus on the 1% is what fits underneath the real performance.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. And any comment on the outlook for the beer category relative to some of the other alcoholic beverage categories in Canada?","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Stewart, do you want to follow-up on that?","Stewart F. Glendinning - President & Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Brewing Co.","No. I mean I don't have the most recent data for the first quarter; it will be out next week. I think that the broad trends that we have seen in the last couple of years have seen wine gaining share. Spirits hasn't been a major factor for us in Canada. I would step back and look at the health of the beer industry. I think the first quarter had the benefit, obviously, of an extra trading day and Easter, but broadly this quarter has felt healthier than previous years, number one.","Number \u2013 with number two, I would point out, that there are the challenges in Canada that we saw in the fourth quarter, we're limited really to Qu\u00e9bec and to Alberta. In this past quarter, I think the most challenging market remained Alberta, but the rest of the industry looks healthy.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Vivien, the only thing I would add to that is I think if you look at what's has happening on macro level within the beer industry in Canada than consumers generally are choosing to invest their hard earned dollars in some of the higher-priced segments, whether that's craft or Above Premium and imports, the exception to that really has been in Alberta where, obviously, that economy is under a lot of pressure with what we've seen from the oil industry, but not dissimilar to what we've in the U.S. where in a relatively benign volume market that the areas of real consumer momentum tend to be in imports, higher-priced segments like FMBs and craft.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Terrific. That's very helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Judy, how are you?","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So I wanted to ask about Europe. I think the quarter had a pretty decent volume growth, but there was some timing benefit, so just wanted to get a sense of what's happening from a category growth standpoint in some of your key markets, your market share performance? And maybe just, broadly speaking, as you think about certainly MillerCoors becoming a bigger portion of your business going forward, how does sort of Europe fit into your broader strategy and your attempt to kind of grow and accelerate the profit growth in that region?","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Judy. I think there was a couple of questions in there. So, Simon, why don't you take the first part of the question and just talk a little bit about the momentum we're seeing in our Europe business and then I'll touch on the impact of MillerCoors more broadly?","Simon Cox - President & CEO-Molson Coors Europe, Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Thank you, Judy. So, if you look to that top-line results, Judy, then our volumes grew by just over 5% in Europe in the quarter and that translated into just over 4% top-line on net sales revenue growth if you extract currency changes. So, we were very pleased with that. We think that's a very, very solid performance.","And to answer your question and give that some context, the markets in which we operate were pretty much flat from a volume perspective. So, in other words, we gained share and we would calculate that to be about an 0.6% or 0.7% share gain across the quarter, which again I think is very solid. And I think, pleasingly, it's share gain driven by the majority of our countries, by the majority of our main brands, and we also saw some pretty good trends on our premium brands.","So, overall, if you're looking for our performance in the context to the market, good performance on volume, strong performance on revenue, good share gain and a good shape to the portfolio growth as well.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Simon. Judy, any follow-up for Simon specifically before I talk about MillerCoors?","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No. I'm good with Simon. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Simon. And then, Judy, just to your broader question about Europe and the impact of MillerCoors, as business as usual we've got a big business and it'll be a bigger business in the U.S. We have a big business in Canada. We've got a fast-growing International business and we have a big business in Europe. And we want all of our businesses to be focused on top-line growth.","The European business will have the additional benefit of, in particular, the MGD volumes in the U.K. and Ireland, but it'll be very much business as usual, and I think the opportunity is on that enhanced platform, how we can lift and shift some of our faster growing brands, so brands like the Sharp's portfolio or Franciscan Well, and really leverage them and more broadly internationally. So, very much business as usual. I think you've seen solid improvements and a competitive position in Europe, and we'll continue down that path going forward. Europe is a big part of our overall business and is an important part of our business.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Judy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess Mauricio and Mark, one question for \u2013 or kind of two-part question for you and then also on the subject of Canada, but Mauricio or really Mark I guess, what are Mauricio's priorities, now that he is the new CFO? And then, Mauricio, you come with the experience from Beam and is there anything special about that experience that you think pertains to the job at hand for Molson Coors?","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, so let me pickup Mauricio's job description and his goal setting conversation, which will take place probably later this week. I anticipate this being a very seamless transition. We are delighted that Mauricio has joined our business. He's got great experience in both developed and developing markets and across the alcohol sector broadly. And I think he'll come in and be provocative and added value on a number of fronts.","So, I mean, the short-term priorities are pretty clear and I think we've been consistent on that, Mark, which is we've got to deliver our 2016 plan, make sure that we are delivering both top-line, bottom-line and the strong cash performance and be prepared to go when the deal is approved and then subsequently close this (31:57) in relation to MillerCoors and Miller International and Mauricio is going to play a very explicit part on that agenda. It's really no more complicated than that. I don't know, Mauricio, if you want to say, hi and offer any further perspectives.","Mauricio Restrepo Pinto - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. Thank you, Mark and Mark. With one full day under by belt, I guess \u2013 what I can say is that, I'm very excited to be here at Molson Coors. It is a company with outstanding people and great brand portfolio, and it's really a very exciting time for the company. And I'll be essentially focusing on furthering the strategy of the company which is to delight the world's beer consumers with our products. As Mark said, offering hopefully some interesting points of view in terms of my experience in the spirits industry and formerly at SABMiller. That being said, I look forward to seeing and meeting most if not all of you in person at our event in New York in early June.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's great. Okay. Thank you for that. And if I could also on Canada and Mark or Stewart, I guess I want to focus particularly on Coors Light and Molson Canadian and what I'm \u2013 what I'd like to better understand is why we really are coming around the corner, because we've been coming around the corner for quite some time with these two brands. And it sounds like you feel a little better, but \u2013 and I guess you're going to be spending more, and so that in itself is real. But what are you seeing that makes you think that maybe it's not second quarter, maybe it's 2017. These brands really are in a better position than they've been because I appreciate you've been working hard on correcting the issue, but it's still an issue and the U.S. is improving, Molson Canadian is not a U.S. brand of any size, but it's hard from where we sit, at least from where I sit, to believe that anything meaningful is going to change for those two brands anytime soon. So can you give us a little bit more on what's going on there?","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So let me offer \u2013 let me offer a little bit of context. And then Stewart, do you want to just talk about some of the specifics I think are building confidence? But, if you look across our business, Mark, whether that's Coors Light and Miller Lite in the U.S., whether it's the way that Carling's got back into share of segment growth over the last couple of years in the U.K., I think we've got a track record of where we've seen new challenges in our business, continuing to work that challenge, and put in place the right response.","And I think the most recent trends in the U.S. on our two biggest brands demonstrate our ability to get focused with the right inputs in place. And I mean these are big, big brands. It's like driving a -captaining an oil tanker, it doesn't turnaround overnight, but you've got to remain resolute and focused on the right inputs. We've demonstrated that in the U.S. We've demonstrated that in other markets. In all honesty, we had a couple of misfires on some of our consumer communication in Canada. But, I think Stewart and the team have really got to grips with what's required now, and are feeling very good about the quality of our communications that we've got in the marketplace. But, Stewart do you want to just talk about a few more of the specifics that are building confidence as we go into Q2 and in Q3, in particular?","Stewart F. Glendinning - President & Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, sure, Mark. I'd actually just, Mark, just step back one second and just say, that as we looked at our strategic plan three years ago. We really built out three big blocks; one was redoing our supply chain footprint, the other was lowering our G&A cost base, and the third was improving our commercial capability and portfolio.","And those are relevant. Why? Because on the cost base and the supply chain, the savings that we're getting from that has allowed us to start to feed the investments required to get the brands going.","On the brand side, we're really focused on making sure that we had a portfolio that was right for consumers. And on the Above Premium, which is where we built up all the brands, we're performing well and we're really happy with those brands.","On Molson Canadian and on Coors Light, those brands sit in the mainstream. That is the part of the market that is under the most pressure. And if you looked at this past quarter, Canadian held share of the segment and Coors Light did not. So, Coors Light is where our real challenge is.","I've been pretty clear about calling out where the challenges are for Coors Light, those being our need to improve our brand scores. Our need to reach out to millennials and to engage those consumers more actively in our brands. I think when you look at the first quarter from a costs standpoint, our G&A costs went down, and we spent some of that money back in the brand. So, that's moving our strategy.","I think it gives the brand itself, we saw finally the introduction of some marketing that is working. Our advertising is scoring better than any of the campaigns we've seen over the last three years or four years, that's a positive, and we're seeing an uptick in our brand equity. So, those are positives.","I think if you look at the activity that we have for the second quarter and the call out that we made in the earning release and the script this morning, we pointed to the fact that we expect to put more money behind the brands and that is because we have a pretty full activation agenda, we've got a full advertising agenda and we know that we need to spend some money to get the energy going on these brands. So, that's where we are. And I think you'll be in a position in June to hear more from us and to see some of that work when we meet in New York.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's actually very helpful. One quick follow-up. Is there any history or what does the history say about the relationship between the U.S. and Canada for the brand Coors Light? The U.S. is seeing this improvement. Is there a historical analogue to make you believe that you can get some tailwind, so to speak, off of that with this added spending you're going to be doing for the brand in Canada?","Stewart F. Glendinning - President & Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Brewing Co.","I'm not sure whether there is a strong correlation between the markets is because the development of the brands has been a little bit different. But what I will say is that, we've been working well together as a North American group to understand what drives our consumers. You will see us leveraging more ideas back and forth between the two business units. And in fact, here in the next few weeks, you will see us starting to use some of that U.S. messaging.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Great. Thank you, Stewart. Thanks, Mark.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Your line is open.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning, everyone. Look, I mean, just two quick questions. The first one Mark, in very general terms, 10 months after \u2013 almost six months, seven months after that we know the MillerCoors transaction, do you have more, the same or less conviction about the guidance with $100 million synergies? So, if you can answer that and maybe give some color in terms of why?","And then the second question related to these questions you had, in global terms, after the transaction has closed, MillerCoors, the U.S. market is going to be about 80% of your earnings. What about trying to diversify the regional profile of the company later on. Is that a priority, or it doesn't matter at all?","And the reason I ask that obviously is when you hear news about Anheuser-Busch InBev trying to sell their assets in Poland and Czech Republic, are those potential assets that could be of interest to your company? Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Hi, Pablo. Thanks for the questions. To your specific question on the synergy target, I would say having done the planning, I'm more convicted or convinced, that's the right word with regard to the number, but clearly I don't want to talk in any more specifics. I have been pretty clear that once our planning team have finished all of the planning work and we get deal approval and we're moving towards close, then we can update more specifically at that point. But, I think the gains that we offered last November as we work through the planning stands good and we'll update more broadly in due course.","From your question with regard to the center of gravity that would be our business being the U.S. Our overall strategy doesn't change, we will have a bigger position in the U.S. and you know that has many benefits associated with it.","But, we've been on the journey to build a footprint over the course of the last five years, in particular, led by Coors Light and more recently by Staropramen and that will continue. I'm not going to comment specifically on any M&A opportunities. We never do, as you're aware. But we need to play to win in both the U.S., Canada, and in our European business. And we need to continue to build our global footprint, led through our global brands, that's principally been on an asset-light license and export model. It's likely that model will continue as we look to take Coors trademark, Staropramen trademark in the future of the Miller trademark into more markets, that's probably all I can say at this stage.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. That's fine. Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Pablo.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Bryan.","Stewart F. Glendinning - President & Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Good morning, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a couple of short questions. First, in terms of the two breweries that the sale in Vancouver and then the plans to close in Eden. On Vancouver, are there any timing provisions? I guess, you know, if it takes you a while to find a property or find a location or build a brewery, are there any sort of timing provisions we should think about, in terms of when that lease term ends, or are there any timing provisions we should think about there?","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Just on Vancouver?","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just on Vancouver, yeah.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Stewart, do you want to just give a little bit of color on Vancouver?","Stewart F. Glendinning - President & Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. Sure. Bryan, as you point out, we closed the deal this quarter. In terms of the timeline, we have up to five years. So, we've got plenty of time to find and build a new brewery. And, of course, that process is actively underway already.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then in Eden, have you disclosed yet what the plans are for that property, once you close it? Have you \u2013 will it continue, will you sell it? Will it continue to operate as a brewery under someone else's ownership? Just any thoughts on yet, in terms of what happens to that brewery, kind of post closing it?","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The very specific response, Bryan, is that, no, we haven't disclosed anything in relation to Eden other than our plan to close the brewery. And Gavin and the team are working through the process at this point in time, and it's going as anticipated. I don't know whether, Gavin, you'd want to add anything to that?","Gavin Hattersley - Chief Executive Officer, MillerCoors LLC","No, Mark, other than to say, we just haven't made a decision as to what to do with the facility and land, at this point in time, as you correctly stated.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And just the reason why I asked the question is just, you've got a lot of capacity that's being added to the industry from the craft beer industry, and the capacity that Constellation is adding in Mexico is essentially U.S. brewing capacity. So, I'm just trying to get a sense for whether or not just the capacity in the industry at all overall sort of affects your decision-making in terms of what you might decide to do?","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I think, Gavin, do you want to pick up on that?","Gavin Hattersley - Chief Executive Officer, MillerCoors LLC","Yeah, I was going to say, Bryan, we're focused on the moment of closing the brewery down and transitioning the volume to where it's supposed to be. That's our focus, here. And we just haven't made any decisions on what to do with a facility or the land at this point.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, just the last one, and I might have missed this earlier. But just in Canada this quarter, the distribution, the lower distribution costs, what was that related to, specifically?","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, look, I can give you a headline on that, Bryan. COGS performance in the first quarter was very, very encouraging, probably about half of the COGS improvement related to some timing benefit and that relates specifically just to some distribution charge and the timing of those distribution costs.","I think if you work on the basis, about half of the COGS improvement as underlying and continuing and about half of the COGS improvement in the first quarter or something that will fall away because it was a timing benefit \u2013 I don't think we whether want to get into any more of the specifics at this stage.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Your line is open.","Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you very much. Could you talk a little bit about how Coors Light is doing globally? I'm guessing there was some impact in terms of what was happening in India, so perhaps maybe kind of a number, a volume number for Coors Light globally, taking India into account?","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Rob. It's Mark here. Just a couple of comments for you. Firstly, Coors Light isn't available in India, so no issues there. I don't think, Kandy has got any plans to launch in India, hasn't spoken to me, I've heard it. So, Coors Light globally was up about 3.5% and across Europe and our international business, we were close to 19% growth.","So, we're seeing very, very strong performance as we take the brand outside of North America, a tremendous traction and velocity and growth in Central and South America. And a brand which has become our second largest brand in our UK and Ireland portfolio and has grown to well over a million hectoliters now across the UK and Ireland.","So, in a number of international markets, but I wouldn't describe it is having a global footprint, center of gravity outside of North America, certainly, Central and South America and our UK and Ireland business. And strong and growing momentum behind the Coors Light brand.","Alongside that, we've introduced Coors 1873 into a couple of markets, as a sister brand of Coors Banquet. And again, we've seen that performed strongly, so we're looking to build out the Coors trademark and that proof-of-concept in Coors 1873, I think, gives us some signals as to how we can build that trademark more broadly going forward.","Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","I just want to make sure I got those numbers right. So globally, including U.S. up 3.5%, and outside of the U.S., up 19%?","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In Europe and MCI combined, it's just under 19% growth.","Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Okay, so outside of North America. That's terrific.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","And as you're going to look to take control of the Miller brands globally, how would you compare, do you think, the potential for those brands with Coors? And how are you thinking about positioning outside of the U.S.?","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We'll \u2013 I mean, I think we're in a great position because the positioning of the brands is very complementary, the Coors positioning is very clear in terms of begin born in the Rockies and owning the whole sense of cold refreshment. Miller is much more of an urban positioning and MGD, in particular, I think it's very complementary to Coors Light. And then, Staropramen clearly operates with a very, very strong check in our European provenance.","In really simplistic terms, Robert, we've got a great clear bottle offering, brown bottle offering and green bottle offering, but that's me probably getting out my depth on my marketing skills. But, I think overall positionings of the brand are very complementary, it gives us more scale in a number of existing MCI markets, and it gives us an entry point into a number of new markets as well.","So, our international business will scale up very significantly on the back of this addition to our portfolio. With what I think will be a great backbone of international brands and around that we can then start to really test our ability to build some of the international footprint for some of our craft brands as well. So, I think, we're poised for the next phase in international brand development.","Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Okay. And any comments on, I know it's very small, but just in terms of understanding how the portfolio is doing, and the business in Australia. And whether, is that a template for other countries?","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. I'll pass that across to Kandy. Kandy, do you want to just comment on our Australia business?","Krishnan Anand - President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors International, Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Sure. Thanks, Mark. Rob, as you mentioned, it's a relatively small part of our business; however, we launched there now. It's little over 18 months. We launched Coors Light, but we have to call it Coors, because of the laws there, which where lights are low alcohol beers only, so it's basically the same born in Rockies, cold refreshment that Mark referred to, but we call it Coors. It's doing well and we've had a really good summer season, we just finished in Australia in March.","And we're looking forward to also add the Miller portfolio to that. With the two we'll actually increase our scale in Australia more than twofold with the addition of Miller. So, I would say, it's something that we believe in the long run, well, we bought a reasonable size business as well as reasonably profitable business. And it's going to take a while to grow these two brands.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Does it make sense?","Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","And U.S. craft beers, are taking off in many countries. Any just final quick thoughts on early potential, early insight into Blue Moon and the ability of that brand to gain traction overseas?","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think it's a good observation, Robert. And I think we've led that wave with the development of Blue Moon in a number of markets. Obviously, we've now got Belgian Moon up in Canada. Blue Moon has been in our UK and Ireland business for a number of years and is growing strongly. And Kandy and his team now have gone into a multiple markets. Australia is one of those markets, Japan is another market. And interest from around the world continues to grow, so we're already on that path and have been developing that over the course of the last three years to five years, in particular and we're seeing demand growing.","I think we're in a strong position when you look at the number one Irish brand, the leading brand in UK with Sharp's and our Canadian brands as well. There is opportunities for us to really build out that craft portfolio at international level and that's central to some of our international expansion thinking at this point in time.","Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Terrific. Very exciting. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Robert.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Filippe Goossens with MUFG. Your line is open.","Filippe Goossens - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.","Yes, good morning, gentlemen. And thanks for the call this morning again. I had two questions, although I think the first one has been indirectly answered, it was more from an M&A perspective, trying to find out if there was any remote interest perhaps in the Pilsner Urquell brand that AB InBev is putting up for sale. But I'll take your comments for that on the earlier question.","My second question, if I may, is given the Carling business in the UK, how are you seeing the potential for the Brexit potential vote next month in England? Would that cause meaningful issues for you, or that's something that is relatively managed within the scope of the operations in Europe? Thank you very much.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Filippe. So, thanks for your acknowledgement on the M&A question. I would just mention, obviously our definitive agreement with ABI is the Pilsner Urquell brand remains in our portfolio in the U.S. on a perpetual royalty-free basis. So that's in our portfolio currently and will remain in our portfolio, irrespective of what's been announced last week by ABI and SAB divestiture.","With regard to the Carling business in the UK and Brexit, that's a great question. I think if you ask 10 commentators, you'd probably get 10 different points of view. I mean it's outside of our control, the consumer demand in the UK for Carling and our other brands, I think will remain unaffected by whatever decision is made.","The impact on currency and any translational impact, I think is probably the thing that we're keeping our eye on it at the moment, but I don't think it will affect any real demand patterns in the UK, which is clearly what we're really interested in. I don't know Simon, whether you'd offer any more color on that, it's just such a difficult one to call, but any perspective, Simon?","Simon Cox - President & CEO-Molson Coors Europe, Molson Coors Brewing Co.","No. I think it's similar to you, Mark. I mean of all the things that we should keep our eye on, it wouldn't be one of the things that necessarily keeps me awake at night. I just don't see it actually having any material impact on the overall demand in the beer market in the UK. And I certainly think based on our recent trends of Carling performance on that portfolio in the UK, we'd be able to withstand whatever effect did come. So no, I wouldn't put that in any future model of any real importance, no.","Filippe Goossens - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.","So, it seems then basically if there's any issue at all, it's most likely going to come from a translation perspective, as it relates to the impact on the currency, but nothing in terms of demand. Is that a fair summary?","Simon Cox - President & CEO-Molson Coors Europe, Molson Coors Brewing Co.","I think, that's reasonable. Yeah.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Filippe Goossens - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.","Thank you, gentlemen.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hello. Thanks. Hi, again guys. Thank you for taking this follow-up. Simon, I wanted to understand a little better what is happening in Europe, in the sense that it's clear the UK is benefiting from this introduction, and I presume you're taking some share there, and then these other markets that drove the volume increase, I presume your taking share there. Can you give us a little more sense of either the theme that's underlying share gains versus those markets where you're seeing share losses, if there is a theme? But 11 countries is a lot. Don't know that we need to go into every single one, but I'm just trying to better understand the other side of the coin, if you will. The markets where you're not having the success you'd like. That's what I'm trying to understand.","Simon Cox - President & CEO-Molson Coors Europe, Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Simon, do you want to answer that.","Simon Cox - President & CEO-Molson Coors Europe, Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. Sure. I mean, to your point, Mark, I think, we could spend a lot of the time doing individual diagnosis on 11 different countries. I think, the theme that I will point you to is that, in general, we are increasing our investments in marketing and those investments are playing out well for us with stronger volumes, stronger revenues and premiumizing that portfolio. And actually, that's a factor virtually across all the markets.","So if for example, I took Staropramen, we are investing in Staropramen across all of our European markets, and we've also repatriated that into the UK, and we're investing behind it, and that's giving us double-digit growth almost universally, actually across those markets.","So, there are always you know some puts and takes from a timing perspective in individual markets, but our general strategy of investing behind our core brands and investing in premiumization is working at the aggregate level in Europe and any countries that isn't true in this quarter, I'd been confident that we could continue to drive those countries back towards the norm. So, I don't think, there's actually as much variation as perhaps you might be pointing to. And I think overall, our strategy is just working in aggregate.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's very helpful. And one quick follow-up. Of those markets that did not participate in the 5% volume increase, what's the largest of those markets? Countries?","Simon Cox - President & CEO-Molson Coors Europe, Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. We don't intend to break those down. So, I wouldn't want to get into market-by-market commentary, if that's okay, Mark?","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Sure, enough. Okay. Thank you, Simon.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning, guys. Just a quick one.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Brett.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","The pushing of near beer or FMBs continues to be an avenue of growth for you in the industry. Do you see any risk of heightened regulatory scrutiny from FMBs getting closer and closer to non-alcoholic beverages?","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Brett, let me give you just a couple of comments on that. Obviously, selling alcohol is something that you know comes with a significant obligations and we are \u2013 and all of our markets very, very careful about the way that we both introduce and market brands.","FMBs have been a big part of our business for the last couple of decades back in the UK. We, in the mid-1990s, launched a brand called Hooch, which was you know one of the forerunners of the FMB category and it's been you know part of our business as a safer you know a couple of decades now. So, we are very careful, very responsible, very clear about the fact that these are adult drinks, they're clearly marked as adult drinks and will continue to comply with all regulations in all of our markets to build our portfolio responsibly. I think beyond that, it's probably not worth getting into any specifics. So, that's just our general philosophy in our business.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","All right. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Brett.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Your line is open.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you for taking the follow-up. Look, Gavin, I realize I asked questions relating to MillerCoors call earlier today, but three very quick ones for you. So, is the industry traditionally, will increase prices in the fall and most of the companies would follow. Has the industry changed in that regard? And what happened really with that price increase in the fall? Did it stick or not? That's the first question.","The second one, in the earlier call you said that pricing ex-mix was up 0.8% for the MillerCoors portfolio. Can you just give us some new ones there, in terms of what was increase in the value brands, compared to say mainstream? It seems to me that on value-price, pricing might have come down, if you can explain that.","And then the third and last question I think that Miller High Life, it's in my opinion in a very unique position within your value portfolio. And one would think that it may be stacking between mainstream and value, and that there's an opportunity for you to have a very strong value brand, if Miller High Life were to trend down price wise into fully the value segment, as opposed to what seems to be happening, that it's moving up to mainstream. If you can just comment on that Gavin, and thanks for taking the follow-up again.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey Gavin. Do you want to pick up on let's call it some general comments without getting lost in any of the specifics?","Gavin Hattersley - Chief Executive Officer, MillerCoors LLC","Right. I mean, Pablo it's little difficult for me to give you a detailed specifics as Mark says. And from an industry pricing point of view, you know price increases take place in the fall, they take place in the spring, there is no general one-size-fits all. And as I've said quite often on these calls is, we follow very clear pricing strategy and market-by-markets and brand-by-brand basis.","And your second question is around breaking out the 80 basis points between the various sub-segments is, we just simply don't do that publicly. And from a Miller High Life point of view, we do think we've got a unique proposition here as the Champagne of Beers and we intend to continue to invest quiet strongly behind that brand, it's an important part of our sub-premium portfolio and we'll play an important role in reducing the lost market share that we've experienced in the primary portfolio. Beyond that, I can't really get into any more detail.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","All right. Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Pablo, the only thing I would add is, I mean, if you look at the choice in the U.S. market now as probably be, there's more proliferation, more choice for consumers than we've seen in living memory. So, our job is to make sure our brands deliver great value for consumers and we'll make sure we do that through a combination of our price points, SKUs that we offer, the quality of our brand communications.","We got to be competitive. And as I say, consumers have got more variety and more choice than they've ever had before. So, we've got to be really sharp, we've got to stay very local, and we've got to ensure that we are competing very effectively in the marketplace.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it.

Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior-year period in U.S. dollars.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors.","Mark Hunter","Thank you, Chad. And hello and welcome everybody to the Molson Coors earnings call. Many thanks for joining us today.","With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have; Mauricio Restrepo, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, our CEO of our U.S. business, Fred Landtmeters, the CEO of our Canada business; Simon Cox, the CEO of our Europe business; and Stewart Glendinning, the CEO of our International business, along with Sam Walker, our Global Chief Legal Officer, and Dave Dunnewald, our VP of Investor Relations.","Today, Mauricio I will split our call into two parts; first, we will take you through our third quarter 2016 results to an essence closeout Molson and Coors Brewing Company, as it's been structured for the past several years. Then, we'll turn our attention to our recently completed MillerCoors transaction, and three newer updated financial reporting metrics along with some perspective for the fourth quarter of this year. In third quarter we continue to focus on our First Choice ambition on building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investment as we've discussed all year.","Business highlights for the quarter and year-to-date included increased net sales revenue per hectoliter on a constant currency basis in all our businesses for the quarter and year-to-date. We increased investments in our brands globally. Coors Light and Miller Lite again gained share in U.S. Premium Light segment for the quarter, including the highest segment share gain in three years for Coors Light. We saw 1.2% global volume growth for Coors Light on a year-to-date basis, with growth of more than 14% outside of North America. We had fast growing innovations in key markets including Henry's Hard Soda in the U.S. and Mad Jack in Canada. And we saw global growth year-to-date in our above premium portfolio, for example, Doom Bar and other Sharps brands in the UK, Creemore Springs and Belgian Moon in Canada and our four newly acquired brewers in the U.S.","We also so strong growth by Staropramen across Europe outside of its whole markets and we also additionally saw cider volume increases with Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. Overall, we continue to strengthen our business through improvements through our sales execution and revenue management capabilities increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of common global systems.","Regional highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are as follows; in the U.S. overall sales to retail volume decreased 4% for the quarter, and 2.5% year-to-date on a trading day adjusted basis driven primarily by our below premium and premium light brands. Coors Light and Miller Lite again gained segment market share, the SDR's declined reflecting industry trends. Coors Banquet continue to grow SDR volume and segment share. And in a higher market above premium segment, Henry's continues to be the number one Hard Soda franchise. Also our Saint Archer, Sheraton [ph] Hop Valley and revolver businesses of significantly expanded our craft offering for consumers and customers.","Domestic net sales revenue per hectoliter grew 1.6% for the quarter, and 1.2% year-to-date as a result of favorable net pricing and positive sales mix. On the bottom line, U.S. segment underlying equity income increased 9% in the third quarter driven primarily by lower cost of goods sold, higher net pricing and positive sales mix. Year-to-date underlying equity income increased 9.3%, primarily due to the factors mentioned above, as well as a $12.3 million anticipated refund of federal excise tax paid on imports which we discussed on our last earnings call.","In Canada, net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 0.6% driven by growth in our above premium brands. This NSR increase reflected hairline price increases and positive brand mix but with higher levels of spend back as we ensured our brands were competitive on a market-by-market basis. Our performance in the above premium segment continue to be strong as we saw growth in both their own brands and their partner brands. Coors Banquet, Mad Jack, and Belgian Moon; all continued to deliver strong growth and our craft brands continue to grow share in the total beer category.","The mainstream segment continue to face market pressure where our brand held scores for Coors Light and Molson Canadian have continued to improve month-over-month; and our sales execution input measures are similarly improving. Our COGS per hectoliter increased 3.5% in local currency with most of the increase being driven by volume deleverage and mix shift to higher cost products. Our cost savings program continue to be strong and fully offset impacts of inflation and other cost increases in the quarter. In the bottom-line underlying pre-tax income claimed by $15.9 million in the third quarter driven by lower volume, increased COGS, higher marketing investments and foreign exchange impacts of U.S. dollar-based supplier contracts.","Europe net sales decreased 0.6% in local currency for the third quarter driven by 1.4% lower volume due to weaker demand versus strong sales last year across much of the region. Along with some trade inventory overhand from the Euro 2016 Football or Soccer Championships in the second quarter of this year. Nonetheless, we held our share position in the region and our continued portfolio premiumization and mix management drove a 1.2% increase in net sales revenue per hectoliter in local currency. In the quarter, we achieved strong growth by Coors Light, Staropramen outside of the Czech Republic, and their craft portfolio including Blue Moon, Doom Bar, and other the Sharps brands, as well as Rekorderlig cider.","Underlying pre-tax income was lower in the quarter due to higher brand amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit, and unfavorable foreign-currency movements, especially related to the depreciation of the British pound. Year-to-date the benefit of higher net sales and NSR per hectoliter in local currency, volume and market share in Europe were more than offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements, higher brand amortization expense, lower pension benefits and the termination of the Heineken contract arrangement in the UK.","Our international business continues to drive Coors Light momentum with year-to-date volume of this brand, up mid-single digits led by growth in Latin America and Australia. Excluding impacts of total alcohol prohibition in Bihar, India and the transfer of the Staropramen UK business to our Europe segment, our year-to-date underlying pre-tax underlying performance has significantly improved versus last year driven by volume growth in the remaining international markets.","Now I will turn it over to Mauricio to give third quarter financial highlights and new performance metrics. Mauricio? ","Mauricio Restrepo","Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. So our third quarter and year-to-date financial headlines are as follows; net sales were down approximately 7% in U.S. dollars in the third quarter and about 5% year-to-date, primarily due to currency movements, especially in Europe, as well as lower worldwide volume.","On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 2.2% in the third quarter and were virtually unchanged year-to-date versus the same period last year. Our net sales per hectoliter in constant currency increased 1.3% in the quarter and 0.9% year-to-date due to positive mix. On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported third quarter after-tax income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $202.5 million, up from $13.7 million a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by cycling $275 million of impairment charges recorded for certain Europe brands last year.","On a year-to-date basis, U.S. GAAP after-tax income increased 67.5% to $539.8 million, driven by brand impairment charges last year, and a gain on the sale of our Vancouver Brewery earlier this year. Third quarter underlying after-tax income decreased 14.3% to $222.7 million or $1.03 per diluted share, driven by lower worldwide volume, a higher underlying tax rate, and higher brand investments globally, which were partially offset by positive mix and higher underlying U.S. equity income.","Year-to-date underlying after-tax income decreased 5.5% to $576.4 million, driven by the same factors as in the quarter along with the negative foreign currency movements. Underlying pre-tax income declined 6.2% for the third quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $403.1 million, 4.1% lower than a year ago and our year-to-date underlying EBITDA declined 0.8%. Underlying free cash flow in the first three quarters of 2016 was $469.4 million. This represents a decrease of $24.9 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower underlying after-tax income and lower distributions from MillerCoors.","Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $9.9 billion, cash and cash equivalents totaled slightly less than $10 billion resulting in a net cash position of $94 million as we prepare to close the MillerCoors transaction on October 11. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial result in the quarter. Also, please see the Investor Relations page of our website this morning for updated 2015 full-year and 2016 year-to-date pro forma financial statements that reflect our preliminary purchase accounting for the transaction.","Now looking forward to the remainder of 2016, following are some financial factors to consider for the fourth quarter. Our Europe business results will continue to reflect lower net pension benefit. Total alcohol prohibition in Bihar has presented a headwind in an international business since its enactment in April this year and we will continue to address this within our business. And finally, foreign currency translation, which at current exchange rate would be a headwind of approximately $8 million to our underlying pre-tax results in the fourth quarter this year, with all of the impact in Europe. Given the volatility of our key foreign currencies, particularly the British pound, it is important to watch these rates closely.","Now regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following metrics exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction. For the full year, we continue to expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 million, including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions and expense. Underlying capital spending of approximately $220 million which excludes capital this year related to the construction of our new brewery in British Columbia, which we expect to be largely funded by the proceeds from the sale of our Vancouver Brewery earlier this year.","MG&A expense in corporate of approximately $120 million on an underlying basis which excludes expenses related to the MillerCoors transaction. Consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million on an underlying basis which excludes transaction-related interest expense and income. An underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22% assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits, excise tax deductions or share-based compensation or adjustments to our uncertain tax position.","As far as our cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect full year 2016 cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe to increase at a low single-digit rate in local currency, and we expect a low single-digit decrease in MillerCoors and a double-digit increase in international versus prior year. As we first mentioned several months ago, with the completion of the MillerCoors transaction we are no longer providing the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses.","Earlier this year we told you that we would share more specifics regarding three new performance metrics with you once the transaction closed. These metrics are transaction adjusted EPS, and all in multi-year cost savings target, and an early view of our combined company underlying free cash flow target for 2017. So taking these in order; transaction adjusted EPS is a new, non-GAAP performance measure we are introducing to provide enhanced visibility to the performance and value of our Company post-transaction. To calculate this measure we start with underlying book EPS, a non-GAAP measure, and then add back after-tax book amortization that is directly related to the transaction, and we then add the transaction-related cash tax benefits.","Based on our latest pro forma financial statements which we will post on our website this morning, our 2015 pro forma transaction adjusted EPS was $6.11 per diluted share on an underlying basis. This calculation includes transaction-related after-tax book amortization of approximately $42 million and cash tax benefits of $275 million per year, but it does not include any pre-tax income related to the Miller global brands nor any benefit from deal synergies. Because the routes to market and supply chain structures for many of the Miller global brands markets are still being developed, the cost and margin structure for these businesses are also a work in progress. As a result, we have decided to exclude the Miller global brands from our pro forma results for periods prior to the close of the transaction. For the first three quarters of 2016, pro forma transaction adjusted EPS was $5.43 per diluted share, an increase of 4% versus $5.22 per diluted share for the first three quarters of 2015.","Going on to our second metric, cost savings over the next three years; we have set and all-in target of $550 million which will be made up of ongoing cost savings in all of our businesses, as well as transaction related synergies, all of which will be delivered by the third full year of our combined company which is 2019. Approximately half of this three-year cost savings target is synergies which represents a synergy goal that is nearly 40% larger and 25% faster than the original $200 million synergies target over four years that we shared with you when we announced the transaction nearly a year ago.","We expect the synergies delivery to be weighed towards years two and three while the other cost savings will be weighted toward years one and two of the program. As we have been discussing for the past year, we expect these cost savings to come primarily from the areas of global procurement and shared services along with North American supply chain, so they will primarily benefit the cost of goods sold line. As part of the planning process for the past year, we have also identified a moderate amount of savings from information systems. Please note, that we do not plan to provide additional specifics regarding annual phasing of the cost savings or a detailed breakout of transaction-related synergies versus other cost savings.","Related to this cost savings goal, we anticipate incurring approximately $350 million of one-time incremental cash cost over three years to capture synergies, about evenly split between incremental capital spending and cash operating expense, primarily in the first two years of the program. Note that the incremental CapEx would be on top of our recent all in CapEx run rate of approximately $650 million to $700 million, plus or minus 10%, including 100% of MillerCoors CapEx in recent years. With a base CapEx spend of approximately $2.1 billion over the past three years, the CapEx needed to capture synergies represents an increment of less than 10% to our current run rate. We will continue to apply our pack model to these and all other significant potential capital and cash deployment decisions to help ensure that they are aligned with our priorities.","Finally, as always, when these cost savings initiatives are completed in three years we will continue to pursue cost reductions across our business in order to provide resources to help drive our top line, bottom line and shareholder value.","Finally, to help you model our business we also want to share our preliminary underlying free cash flow target for 2017, which is $1.1 billion plus or minus 10%. ","Note, that this target includes the impact of incremental interest expense, U.S. tax expense, and synergies related CapEx in 2017, as well as the cash tax benefits resulting from the transaction. As in the past we plan to report back to you each year regarding how we are performing against these targets.","So at this point I'll turn it back over to Mark for highlights of the transaction, business outlook, and Q&A. Mark.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Mauricio. This clearly is a historic time in the evolution of Molson Coors. Three weeks ago we completed our acquisition of the remaining 50% stake in the Miller Coors joint venture, along with the Miller global brand portfolio. We emerge as the world's third largest for bringing together Molson Coors and Miller Coors into a bigger, better organization, as one Company with an expanded portfolio of iconic brands, we intend to leverage or increase scale, resources, synergies and combine commercial experience to accelerate our First Choice agenda and deliver long-term shareholder value. ","Because of this game changing transaction, Molson Coors now controls 100% of the highly strategic and attractive U.S. business, and will accelerate new growth the properties in emerging and developing beer markets globally with the Miller brand rights. This transaction also improves our operating efficiency and go to market strategy by changing our commercial capability in a truly global scale. ","Financially, this is a compelling combination based on a very attractive price, ground operational synergies, substantial cash tax benefits, and the attractive financial package that we put in place earlier this year. As a reminder, for $12 billion of cash, we have purchased the remaining 58% of the Miller Coors joint venture that we didn't already own. ","The ownership of the Miller brands, which outside of the U.S. we managed in more than 50 countries by our Molson Coors international, Molson Coors Canada and Molson Coors Europe businesses. Perpetual growth of free U.S. licensees for the existing ASP Miller import license brands, including Perrone, Fosters, gross and Reds [ph] for which Miller Coors most recently paid royalties of approximately $60 million in 2015. ","And finally, because this is an asset transaction for U.S. tax purposes, we will receive immediate cash tax benefits that we now estimate will exceed $275 million annually, for the next 15 years. This represented an increase from a previous estimate of more than $250 million per year due to the detailed tax diligence work that we completed during last year. ","The purchase price implies a headline enterprise by the multiple 11 times 2015 combined underlying EBITDA. When including the present value of the cash tax benefits to purchase multiple drops in effect of 9.2 times. These tax benefits are common with this type of asset transaction and they carry a high degree of certainty. As such we believe this is the most appropriate way to value this combination. ","This represents a very attractive purchase multiple, even though it does not include the anticipated benefit of our transaction related synergies. We expect this combination to be accretive to underline diluted EPS and transaction adjusted EPS in the first full year of operations before synergies and we expect it to meet our Cardinal rates in year one, which is consistent with their disciplined use of cash framework. ","Now, looking forward as a combined Company, our teams are focused on driving our First Choice agenda. Finishing the year with strong performance in each of our businesses and hitting the ground running and integration. You've heard us speak about these themes in the past for each of our businesses will continue to focus on transforming our portfolio to a the above premium segment, introducing value driving innovation, integrating the Miller brands and lifting and shifting best practices of talent across the global organization. ","To provide just a few examples by business, in the U.S. [indiscernible] focus on the development integration of these new craft Partners, Saint Archer, Terrapin, Hop Valley and Revolver. And FNB's Henry led a new hard great flavor to its line of hard sodas, we will introduce a new line of hard sparkling waters to claim the growing alcohol sparkling water category. ","Henry's Hard Sparkling will be launched nationally in March with lemon lime and passionfruit flavors. Reds and Blue Moon Belgian white introduce new aluminum pipe packaging in the second quarter of 2017. ","Over the past few months we've built a strategy that elevates volume across our economy portfolio. For example, Miller High Life recently announced plans to reintroduce -- that brings back its classic jingle if you've got the time we've got the beer. We will also revamping its packaging for a further the unique heritage. ","Elsewhere, across the economy portfolio, Hams will be reintroduced nationally at an opening price point in Milwaukee's Best is getting a total packaging update to give a fresh new look. And beginning early in 2017 we willfully revamp Keystone light including only packaging and advertising. For innovation in the value category, we are introducing spike watermelon reserve brand family and we are increasing the size of our PET bottle singles from 40 ounces to 42 ounces for the same price, again to deliver value to our consumers and customers.","In Canada, our team is integrating the Miller brands back into our portfolio and will double down on the above premium MGD. We're also assessing the opportunities for Miller high life and other U.S brands that we can lift and shift into the Canada market. Mad Jack is performing well in the FNB space and we will consider other innovative options to drive value for our Canada consumers and customers. In Europe, we now have the Miller brands in the U.K and Ireland and this business is also repairing to begin managing the international license and export business in the region starting in January 1. This will allow us to drive and other league brands were fully aligned strategies across Europe. We will also continue to build our craft portfolio, including further expansion of Blue Moon across the region. ","Our international business is well on the way to full integration of the Miller global brands into our portfolio, and we\u2019re leveraging a new footprint, strategy in emerging markets. For example, in Panama and Honduras where our Partners have already embraced Coors Light we are ready to accelerate growth with the addition of the Miller brands. The international team has also begun planning process for transitioning to Puerto Rico over from Miller Coors on January 1. Going forward Coors and Miller brands will be priority brands for international business. ","To summarize, we are delighted to have completed the MillerCoors transaction which is a compelling, strategic and financial opportunity for our Company and our shareholders that catapults Molson Coors to the next level. In this combination key priorities in three specific areas. Firstly, in brand lead growth the cash tax benefits and cost savings made possible by this transaction will provide resources that we can invest and accelerating the transformation of the front end of our business through, for example, investing behind our core brand across all of our geographies, premiumizing our portfolio and engaging with consumers in new ways, including cross-border exchange of category changing innovation, expanding the depth and reach of our international brands and fast growing markets, including securing a certain and aligned future for the Miller brands globally, and finally, leveraging our shared commercial capability through extraordinary brand building, world-class insight, digital leadership and unrivaled customer excellence. ","Secondly, this transformation of our Company offers unique opportunities for us to drive cash generation, through substantial tax benefits, cross synergies, cross-border working capital improvements and disciplined use of our pack model across the combined Company. We expect all of these benefits to provide strong free cash flow and allow us to quickly pay down acquisition debt and maintain our commitment to investment-grade debt ratings. ","And thirdly, this transaction represents a prudent high return use of cash for Molson Coors on our shareholders. We're using this transaction only to make Molson Coors a bigger Company, but also a better Company with our integration complexity normally found in a deal of this size. ","As we focus on deleveraging our balance sheet over the next two to three years, we expanded our share repurchase program and have announced we plan to maintain our current dividend of share level and we will revisit our dividend policy once deleveraging is well underway. ","Overall, this combination is a game changer in our ambition to become First Choice for consumers and customers, and it's highly consistent with our goals and our focus on building extraordinary brands, delivering innovation and driving significant volume to our shareholders. ","Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 1:00 PM Eastern time today Dave Dunnewald, will host a follow-up conference call which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our Quarterly Results. This call will also be available for you to hear be a webcast on our website. ","At this point, Chad, we would like to open up for questions, please. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Wendy Nicholson","Good morning. Just a quick clarifying question. That $1.1 billion free cash I never did that include or exclude the cost required to get your synergies? Just a housekeeping item? And then second thing, of the $559 of savings to come, can you talk specifically about how much reinvestment specifically in advertising you expect to redeploy? I know some of the strength in Coors Light is probably a function of the fact that spending is up a lot in the year-to-date period in the U.S, so I'm just wondering about sort of targeted reinvestment level you can help us? Thanks. ","Mark Hunter","Hi, Wendy, thanks for your questions, two questions. Let me just touch on the savings number and then Mauricio can just clarify in the free cash flow number. With regards to savings we don't offer guidance as to how we will allocate those savings through our business. I don't want to constrain our business with any specific formula. And clearly as we drive the savings they will either drop to the bottom line or be reinvested back into our business or offset for example inflation on our business. We continue to review our Sales and Marketing investment on a geography by geography basis. We now have a return on marketing investment model which is allowing us to drive significant efficiencies in our marketing spend, and we will continue to monitor our level of spend in each of our markets to make sure we can support our brands and a way that allows them to be competitive but were not going to offer specific guidance on allocation of those savings. On the free cash flow number, Mauricio do you want to just clarify? ","Mauricio Restrepo","Yes. Good morning, Wendy. The $1.1 billion is after taking into account the cost required to deliver the synergies. ","Wendy Nicholson","Got it, but just as follow-up to conceptual I know you said in your remarks that you're pleased that the Coors Light brand held scores have improved. To what do you attribute that? I mean again we track the advertising spending and it looks like that's gone up a lot in the US but is there other stuff specifically that you can call out that you're doing weather is distribution, whether it's work with your salesforce that leading to the stronger brand held scores per se? ","Mark Hunter","Yes, we could get lost in lots of detail here, Wendy, and across all of our businesses using Coors Light go from strength to strength and I think what's at the heart of that is the clarity of the positioning of the brand which is distinctive and consistent. So I've said in the past I would rather spend less money on a great idea that more money on a poor idea and actually I think we\u2019ve got clarity on a position in a great creative platform certainly across our international U.S and our European business. We have now started to transfer the U.S creative platform into our Canada business as well and as we've done that we've seen our brand held scores accelerate in Canada to the last couple of quarters though I really think it comes down to the differentiation and consistency of the positioning. ","Wendy Nicholson","Fair enough, thank you. ","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Wendy. ","Operator","The next question is from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Vivien Azer","Hi, good morning. ","Mark Hunter","Hey, Vivien. ","Vivien Azer","So firstly on the consolidated cost savings number clearly encouraging you being able to upsize that and pull that forward. Would you be able to offer any incremental color on what gives you that enhanced confidence around the total cost save realization? Thanks. ","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Vivien. Let me deal with that. So if you remember at the time we announced the agreement to acquire Miller's tours business we did some quick reasonably well informed analysis on the cost savings opportunity and we suggested it would be around $200 million over four years. Will have the benefit of very, very detailed planning over the course of the last eight or nine months and that work has unearthed further opportunities and really in the detailed planning that's allowed us to move with more pace and set a target that's materially higher than our initial target. ","Vivien Azer","But just in terms of the three buckets that you guys had previously identified is there anyone bucket that's driving and outsize contribution to that more constructive view? ","Mark Hunter","We haven't given any color on the proportionality of the cost savings, but the three areas that we've flagged historically in terms of procurement, North American supply chain, shared services, we've endorsed those numbers that we had originally and some areas they have improved. And in addition to that we've unlocked some additional synergies in the area of IT systems as we consolidate are IT infrastructure and worker pushing out into areas around commercial as well particularly North American level as we look at efficiency of our accretive platforms there, so. But in the roundness still pretty much the same errors we identified initially and hopefully would expect that because of familiarity with the Business is high. So we went into this with a reasonably good estimate of where we could drive the volume. ","Vivien Azer","Perfect. That's very helpful, thanks. Moving on to Canada, I would have expected a slightly better outcome given the level of investment spending that we saw in two Q4 so I was hoping you could comment a little bit more on that? I think you noted the softness in mainstream so it's really a two-part question, do you think that the indefinite spending is doing what it needs to? And does he think ahead to 2017, what potential impact he think is the legalization of recreational cannabis can have on the beer industry in Canada? Thanks. ","Mark Hunter","I would describe it as a broad-spectrum test on your two question everything I was expecting the second part of that so while I'm chatting Stewart get thinking. Me just a couple of comments on the first part dumps and performance in the quarter. Our strategy remains consistent in Canada around making sure that we modernize our supply train and drive our cost down taking for their cost out of our business and improving our overall commercial performance. You aware of some of the changes we made at the leadership level and as Fred is number two in the customer area, across moved from Europe their focus will be on commercial execution really driving our field sales management and model and really I think the plane more assertive execution in the marketplace. That started to show up in some of our information measures. But Stewart, do you want to offer just a little more color on the third quarter? Things that you're pleased about and then if you could think about the recreational drugs question as well perspective on that would be helpful? ","Stewart Glendinning","Yes guess 100%, Mark. So looking at the third quarter, three big drivers of the results. First FX -- transactional FX related to US sourcing of raw materials, lower volumes and higher marketing spend. And on the volume side as Mark pointed out that we are seeing some reaches. We have been growing share in the provinces the West which is having a difficult area for us in September as we saw progress through the third quarter September actually was flat share in Ontario big beer market for us with a growing share in the LC BOM on present. So the number of tough areas is actually shrinking and I think our increased execution certainly will help that. At the same time the higher levels of marketing spend are yielding positive improvements in our brand scores, and of course we expect that we will be able to translate that into improved volumes so that's I'll pause for a second because there's nothing else before I talk about cannabis? ","Vivien Azer","That's really helpful and thanks for indulging the cannabis question. ","Stewart Glendinning","Cannabis is something that we are thinking very carefully about not only as a business but also as an industry. And there's a lot of talk certainly about what it's going -- how it's going to be used and where it's going to be deployed et cetera, but there's just a lot we don't know at the moment. And so we're not even really 100% on clear where it will be sold, when it will be sold, and in the best place I would suggest to look for guidance on what the impact might be would be probably to look at a state like Colorado and see what that has done to beer. But for the moment, we are studying she goes because of the lack of clarity about the deployment of the drug itself. ","Vivien Azer","Fair enough. Thank you. ","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Stewart. ","Operator","The next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Judy Hong","Thank you, good morning. ","Mark Hunter","Good morning Judy. ","Judy Hong","So a few questions, first, Mauricio, the transaction adjusted EPS for 2015 that's now $6.11 versus the $5.72 that you have given us at the September conference, so it went up by $0.39. I think the cash tax went up by $0.12 and I think the book amortization actually went down, so can you just rip them $5.50 to $6.11 what's gone up in that adjustment? ","Mauricio Restrepo","Yes, thank you, Judy so the two items that you mention are correct. What I refer you to the call that we are going to have afterwards led by Dave and you will be able to bridge that. Now the other factor that you are missing there, is the fact that our interest cost went down from that preliminary number of $5.72 that we had given use of the third component that gets you to the EPS, but we will give you a more detailed walk on the comp. ","Dave Dunnewald","Judy, we can give you more details on the call a little bit later but at least the initial headline is that the bridge sorry the pro forma that we put out in May, that you are referring to for the $5.72 transaction adjusted EPS included bridge financing for US GAAP. And then of course the financing we actually put in place for the long-term funding of the transaction actually in a very favorable rates much more favorable than the bridge loan financing, and so that's the driver of lower interest expense. ","Judy Hong","Are the $5.70 is the number you given us in September, correct? I don't think that was the May number. ","Dave Dunnewald","Okay, well, adjustment interest rate, additional refinement of purchase accounting and, right, and the adjustment of cash tax benefits related to the transaction. ","Judy Hong","Okay we can follow up later. And then Mauricio, just on the free-cash flow follow-up. So, can you give us the underlying pro forma free cash flow for either 2015 or 2016? Because I'm just trying to get to the $1.1 billion based on kind of the transaction adjusted EPS numbers that you've given us and it seems to imply very little underlying growth and I'm just trying to see if I'm reading it correctly. ","Mauricio Restrepo","Yes, Judy, look at this point we are just given -- we are going to give you the underlying free cash flow projection for 2017. I would encourage you to a little bit later on we post to the pro forma on our website, you can do your calculations there. Obviously, when you do kind of the back of the envelope math that you can do there, you would think about the free cash flow generation for MillerCoors [ph] and the free cash the generation for Molson Coors [ph] pre the acquisition and you would get to a level of maybe $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion. Now there are obviously some tailwinds that are represented in the form of the $275 million of cash tax benefits but also some headwinds because we have a significant interest expense increase of around $250 million per annum because of the acquisition financing. ","There is additional G&A expense from the step up, due to the fair value re-measurement required by purchase accounting of around $17 million, and there's higher income taxes because now we on the other 58% of MillerCoors so we\u2019re paying additional taxes of around $200 or we will be paying additional taxes around $200 million in 2017 versus what we did before. ","Judy Hong","Okay and the three and $59 of cash restructuring charge is all that hitting in 2017? ","Mauricio Restrepo","No, that $350 million number is what we will be spending, that will be a one-time expenditure but it will be spread over the three-year period. ","Judy Hong","Okay. And then maybe, Gavin, just wanted to get your perspective on the volume performance for MillerCoors in the third quarter. Obviously the industry has been a little bit soft, clearly you still have a vision to get to flat volume by 2018 but just seems like that's a pretty challenging order given the recent trend so do you think that you need to really step up investments even more on some of your key brands? Or do you think this is really just a broader industry problem? ","Mark Hunter","Hey Gavin, do you want to speak to that directly? ","Gavin Hattersley","Yes, sure, thanks, Mark and thanks, Judy. Look you are right, three SCR volumes were down across all brand segments and reflective of the industry. Just as far as our expectations for, do you remember the long-term goals? So expectations are still to be flat in 2018 with growth in 2019, and yes we did see soft industry trends and you see that in our STR figure. But we have now for three straight quarters closed our volume gap with the industry. We've got some work to do on the segment, but we really like our portfolio there with the largest craft brand in the country with Blue Moon and Leinenkugel's was in the top five as well, as we made four acquisitions we're pleased about them, we've grown our flavored malt beverage shared meaningfully over the last year or so. ","Our premium brands continue to perform well. Miller Lite gained share of the premium line segment for the eighth consecutive quarter, Judy, and Coors Light gain share for the sixth consecutive quarter we\u2019ve reengaged the economy drinker and it's a high priority for us. And we've refinanced our economy strategy at the full distributor meeting, that was well received by our distribution network. Our above premium performance specifically was hindered by some of the performance on Blue Moon and Leinenkugel's, but particular seasonally and variety packs and as an industrywide trend and an issue we are addressing we have execution plans for early next year, but we are pleased with our performance on a brand like Grapefruit Shandy which doubled its volume. ","So overall, Judy, it's one quarter and I'm pleased with the performance overall, particularly from a share point of view. ","Judy Hong","Got it. Okay thank you, everyone. ","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Judy. ","Operator","The next question is from Pablo Zuanic, SIG. Please go ahead.","Pablo Zuanic","Good morning, everyone. I want us two questions. The first one bigger picture something that every investor I talked to asks me is what\u2019s the track record of Mark Hunter and why are they the right people to execute here? And of course I asked the question with great respect, right but people look on Felipe having been for 20 years, so what want to understand when we look at MillerCoors of years ago 40 years now Gavin, so if you can answer the question in terms of what your track record, and why should investors be comfortable that this is the right management team to execute this significant plan? And the second question maybe is more for Mauricio, just basically in terms of numbers. I guess there's different ways to judge the guidance that you've given us today. One way I judge it as I look at the cost savings that MillerCoors generate over the last five years on average, about $129 million per annum, $88 million last year, running about $80 million this year, another $99 this year for the third quarter. So you can have $120 million on average over the last five years. ","But then I look at the synergy number you're giving us today, $275 million divided by three is $92 million and then I take out from the balance the Molson Coors saving -- is another $52 million of cost savings, so synergies plus cost savings at MillerCoors and I know that the lines get blurred right about $124 million per annum, over the next three years; which is what MillerCoors did over the last five years. So I am not so sure to be -- how to judge that number nice if you can sustain it, but if this is this significant transaction and there's this plethora of opportunities that we talked about in these cost savings, because you are wonderful Company, why would the cost savings, $124 million as per my math total would be similar to what you been doing for the last five years? I guess if you can answer -- well, those of the two questions. Thank you. ","Mark Hunter","Pablo, it is Mark here. Clearly to your first question I'm not going to conduct a performance review over our quarterly earnings call or get into detail as to why our board believes that I am the right leader for this business and why I believe Gavin is the right leader for this business. I will let the track record speak for ourselves, we are both seasoned professionals who have been the beer industry for a long period of time, given significant change across many businesses, integrated businesses like Starbucks [ph] and driven this transaction at a rate on which on a valuation multiple, I think it is utterly compelling for our business so I'll just leave it there, I'm not going to talk in any more detail with you on that.","Let me just backup one second you asked for Mauricio. What we have endeavored to do here is get full transparency and is sure that we are not duplicating any of the cost savings in our business and clearly we've now set a target for the next three years. We will update that on an annual basis. There was a lot of questions around synergies number and we have scale that up and picked up pace in the synergies number, and we've ensure that there is no duplication with the synergies they are not underlying cost-saving. And we will continue to test our sales if whether that number can be further improved, as we actually get into fully running the Business. But we feel it's a number we can meet and we will attempt to beat it makes sense as we look out at our business which, if you remember has very, very little geographical overlap we are going to try this by a number of restructuring initiatives, setting up things like shared services globally and we will get at that and we will update you if there is any new news on that number but we feel it's the right number for our business at this point in time. ","Pablo Zuanic","Thank you. And just a very quick follow-up regarding cadence I know you're not willing to talk about savings are accretive to the bottom line, but would you be reasonable to assume given that you have this target of stabilizing volumes by 2018 and growing after that, that a lot of the savings would really invest initially we should be thinking more year three and four seeing the accretion decline if you could comment on that that's all. ","Mark Hunter","Thanks Pablo. Again I haven't given any guidance as to how we apportion cost savings, one of things that did indicate earlier this year was that we have now developed a small global growth group led by Kandy. That team will be looking for incremental opportunities to accelerate our topline performance clearly some of those opportunities will require incremental investment in our business. But we will look at those in the round as we aggregate our total Sales and Marketing spend across our business. I'm more interested in the quality of our marketing and I think there's plenty of examples. There's one of the US market one where people are competitors have been spending very aggressively but let's just say that incremental spend always buy you success. ","I'm really focused on the quality and the marketing and the discipline of our execution, and will continue to drive efficiencies across our marketing spend, and if there's a return that makes sense for us as we will put it through the pack model and we will spend incrementally to generate additional return. We want to drive very hard on getting the top line moving in that will be a focus for us over the course of the next 24 to 36 month. I won't get any more specific. ","Operator","Thank you, the next question comes from Mark Swartzberg, Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Mark Swartzberg","Yes, thanks good morning, gentlemen. A couple on the free cash flow and then a couple in the US. On the free cash flow the $1.1 million you mentioned that includes these one-time cash costs. How much of that $350 million is actually in that $1.1 billion? And how much as an expense item and how much as a capital expenditure item? And then are there other one-time items in there? On a per share basis we are at $509 million a free cash flow, you basically tone is the transaction adjusted EPS will be down in calendar 2017 or you are saying there is some pretty significant CapEx, I am just trying to understand what else is going on in that number? ","Mauricio Restrepo","Yes hi, Mark this is a Mauricio. Look we haven't given a specific breakout of the $250 million than to say about half of that would be additional CapEx and half of that would be additional OpEx. Know if you think about the nature of the cost savings are going to deliver including the synergies a lot of the delivery of the synergies will be happening probably towards the latter part of the three-year period which means that actually the investment to deliver those synergies will be weighted towards years one and two. We haven't really given it a specific amount of how much of that will specifically hit 2017. As for the headwinds and tailwinds, the $275 million of cash tax savings obviously that's a tailwind for the next 15 years. The additional interest expense, because of the Company financing, again that something that is going to be there for the foreseeable future, as will the additional DNA expense. Obviously even though that's a non-cash item but something is honestly also going to be there is a generator of those cash tax savings. ","Mark Swartzberg","Okay. I'm still confused only because I'm sitting here with $611 million in your saying this year that number is growing, so call it $6.20, $6.25 represents an transaction adjusted EPS and then the free cash flow view is $5.09 so we are at more than $1 below the transaction adjusted EPS number, which implies again it implies some pretty significant CapEx or something else is going on in transaction adjusted EPS again which is all pro forma for this transaction and doesn't have the international brand so maybe it's a 1:00 o\u2019clock-- so I'm still not I don't know if you have a response to the, yes? ","Gavin Hattersley","Rather than get into the weeds on this call, can I suggest we heard the question and I can give you an answer, so Dave and the team will pick it up this afternoon we will try to give you a bridge to give you the clarity. ","Mark Swartzberg","Okay. Fair enough that would be great. ","Gavin Hattersley","Best way to deal with the question, appreciate the question we will get a response and take you through that and this afternoon's call. ","Mark Swartzberg","Fair enough and just shifting to the U.S, I just a curious, Mark or Gavin, craft has been weak for everybody, so just from a broader industry perspective, why do you think craft has gotten weaker sequentially? And how enduring do you think that is? I know that's hard to have a crystal ball there but what do you think that is? And then, just mechanically for the U.S. business it seems like your distributor inventories are higher than you'd like them to be so is it reasonable to think your own shipments will lag your STRS in the fourth quarter? ","Mark Hunter","So Mark let me split that into two so Gavin, I will pass it across to you on the STRS section in a second, let me offer a couple of headlines around craft. I don't think it's true to say the craft is for weak for everybody, that's a really general statement I think there's a number of craft companies that continue to show very strong growth, and we just acquired a number of them which is a good thing for a business. I think what you are starting to see though in the marketplace is what I describe is probably over supply of flavors and SKUs or beer spirals and SKUs in both retailers and consumers are trying to make sense of the plethora of choice and thus against the backdrop the craft has been good for the beer industry, because it's driven conversations and interest in beer to probably an all-time high, but you get to the point where each SKU has to deliver on a velocity basis and has to actually demonstrate its value to customers and consumers. ","As Gavin mentioned earlier things like seasonal packs, which have been a big driver of the craft industry have really started to come under pressure, because consumers are now in essence making up their own seasonal packs by the way that they actually shop the shelf. But I think what you're starting to see is from a retailer perspective; they really simplified offering and Walmart just did that recently as they reset all of their shelf sets, so the more progressive retailers are really trying to focus on those brands that have got long-term distinctive positioning\u2019s, and drive velocity per SKU. Also thing from a consumer perspective, because most of the craft growth has been driven in the back of heavily held IPAs consumers are recognizing; those beers are great but they are not beers you can probably take with you through a long occasion, and we are actually starting to see some consumers step back into some of the American light brands.","I think it is just craft starting to kind of shake itself out with the brands that are well positioned, clearly distinctive and alongside that the retailers really starting to simplify their offer, and that's incentive at the moment but that starting to have an impact on overall kind of craft velocity or craft trends. Gavin you want to anything to that. And then pick up the STW STRS puff question? ","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks, anything I can add to that, pretty much what you said, I mean there's tons of choice and there's not a lot of floor space, velocity retail is important, so that's why our building with beer program which we launched [indiscernible] had such a positive impact with beer buyers at retail, not only on premise but also off premise. As far as the STWs STRS are concerned, Mark, fundamentally that's just a difference in timing. If you remember at the end of Q2, that dynamic was reversed with domestic STW s down and STRS were down less than that. On a year-to-date basis, those two numbers are much closer and generally, we try and align those things much closer by the end of the year as we try to ship to consumption. I wouldn't get too worked up on quarter-over-quarter because of timing on those price increases and so on. ","Mark Swartzberg","That's great. And if I could real quick and that's very helpful, July 4, Anheuser-Busch [ph] have called out the timing of July 4 as affecting the industry? Do you think the timing of July hurt the industry in the third quarter? ","Mark Hunter","Yes, it did, yes. I would agree with that statement. ","Mark Swartzberg","Great. All right, thanks, Mark. Thanks, guys. ","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Good morning, everybody. I'm going to hold off on the free cash flow question until 1:00 o'clock. Dave, this could be one of the most anticipated 1:00 o'clock calls in a while, I think. So my question is just related to the cost savings and if you could give us some outside of the synergies, if you could give us an sense of like what's included and what's not? You've got the process you're going through in Vancouver in terms of selling the brewery and you'll migrate to a new brewery there. I guess there is a potential the same thing could happen in Montreal. Is Eden, North Carolina brewery in that inside the savings number? Just any sense of some of those bigger items that may be in there would be helpful?","Mark Hunter","Mauricio do you want to? ","Mauricio Restrepo","Yes. Hi, Brian. So with respect to the cost savings -- I mean some of the items that you allude to, that you alluded to during your questions are indeed in there. So for example, the savings that will come from the Eden Brewery closure are included in there. The work that we are continuously doing in terms of looking at our procurement in addition to the savings related to procurement that are in the synergy number and as Mark referenced to earlier, we made a concerted effort to ensure that we've separated what is sort of business as usual savings which as you know a way of doing business here from the piece that's going to come specifically from the synergies. There are also other savings that are coming from looking at our supply chain network that are not included in the synergy piece of the optimization of the North America supply chain grid. So just a lot of savings that are coming from our business as usual run-of-the-mill, running the business vis-\u00e0-vis the synergies that have specifically to do with those three buckets that we alluded to earlier.","Mark Hunter","Brian, this is Mark. The other context point I will give you is over the course of the last three or four years, at an enterprise level we've tried to drive forward what we've described as a one way principles. So across our major functional areas to try and drive for consistency of approach and whether that's world-class supply chain, HR one way, and we're now introducing that from a commercial perspective in terms of our commercial excellence approach, really trying to drive for best practice orientation and consistency of approach wherever we can in the business and that's been one of the drivers for unlocking additional efficiency savings through our business. I think a big part has been in our world-class supply chain where we truly believe that we are world-class or close to world-class in many areas. So we will continue to crack the handle on that and drive as much value and efficiency as we can out of those areas while overlooking the synergy opportunity as well.","Bryan Spillane","All right, thanks, gentlemen. We'll catch up at 1:00 o'clock. ","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Brian. Nice to have you back. ","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Rob Ottenstein","Great. Gavin, we understand certainly the goals on the improvement in the volumes and trajectory for 2018-2019. If that doesn't pan out and if we have a continuation of the current trends -- what sort of opportunities would there be do you think in terms of managing the brewery footprint to address that?","Gavin Hattersley","Mark, do you mind if I take the question direct? ","Mark Hunter","No, just on you go Gavin and I will give you some\u2026","Gavin Hattersley","I was talking to Robert, I'm not planning to fail, right. I think we've got the right plans, the right strategies, the right brands and the right people to get this done. And I wouldn't look at this on a simple quarter basis this is a longer term plan, the industry had a tough quarter, it's surely but our expectations are still flat in 2018 with growth in 2019, and I can run you through all the high-level plans that we've got on our brands but I'm -- we as a business are certainly focused on that goal and believe we will achieve it.","Mark Hunter","And Robert, Miller color there is, as an enterprise level we're committed to supporting putting Gavin and the team to make that happen. There has been lots of questions over the course of the last 12 to 18 months on how will we get there and we've tried to release simplified thinking into three specific areas; our economy, our below premium strategy, and many of you have asked about clarity on our thinking there, that's now been clarified and launched and generated a lot of excitement with their distributors. Many of you have asked about our ability to get Coors Light and Miller Lite growing at the same time and we are now doing that consistently and alongside them Coors Banquet is going from strength to strength.","And we continue to drive the premiumization of our portfolio on the craft acquisitions and Henry's are great examples. Don't forget that Red's which is now such a significant brand didn't even exist just over three years ago. And my view is that we still have untapped opportunities in our own portfolio as well. So all of the component parts are there, a lot of it is down to how worthless we want to be from an execution perspective. But Gavin and the leadership team have driven a significant change in the ambition and energy and focus in our U.S. business and it's been great to see that happening and some quarters will be tougher than others but we are absolutely resolute on our ambition to get this business back into growth trajectory and as Gavin said, that's over the course of the next couple of years.","Rob Ottenstein","That's terrific. On the international side, can you give us -- and I know some of this may have come out earlier on in the prelude but can you give us an update of where you are on the Miller brands globally and had there been any new agreements in terms of supply and distribution?","Mark Hunter","Yes. So let me ask you Kandy [ph], who is obviously transitioning at the moment from his previous role across the Stuart but Kandy's been leading that stream of work. So Kandy do you want to just offer some highlights around that at this stage?","Unidentified Company Representative","Sure. Hi, Robert. So we've got progress in terms of planning and executing a transition of the Miller brands into our systems because it was relatively easier in places like Canada and the UK which came on to our business footprint. We have the cities or markets where we've had existing partners; Panama, Honduras, as an example where we moved the distribution on to our existing partners in the markets which were new to us. We have established with one or two exceptions, almost all of them new distribution agreements that are in place. In terms of production, we are aligned either on our infrastructure like MillerCoors and in certain cases, we are continuing to rely on transitional service agreements by ABI; and we will be working to transition those into our own system as well. But overall, I'm very pleased and Stewart, Simon, Fred are all involved this in terms of transitioning over into our set up, our initial two to three weeks has gone without any significant issues, and so we are quite pleased with the transition.","Rob Ottenstein","Are you able to discuss who any of the -- in the more notable markets, are you able to discuss who any of the new Partners are?","Mark Hunter","We haven't made any kind of public statements around that other than in markets like Panama, we have an existing partner there and we've transitioned across but I think I would probably save that maybe until our Q4 February call. Robert can give a filler update just because we are working through some of the finer detail at this point in time but where there is not a partner in place, there are TSA's, transitional service agreements in place and as I mentioned earlier, I mean some of the markets are doing better than we anticipated, some of the markets are going to take a bit more work to get back on the front so as you would expect in a transition of this nature but we'll get probably more color and a fuller update on our February call.","Rob Ottenstein","Great. Well thank you very much.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Robert.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Hunter for any closing remarks. ","Mark Hunter","I just like to thank everybody for their continued interest at Molson Coors. We've opened a new chapter in the history of our business and as a leadership team, we are delighted to be leading the business forward from this position.

With me in the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have Tracey Joubert, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, the CEO of our U.S. business; Fred Landtmeters, our Canada CEO; Simon Cox, the CEO of our Europe business; Stewart Glendinning, our International CEO; Sam Walker, our Global Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, our Global VP of Investor Relations.","Today, Tracey and I will take you through the highlights of our third quarter and year-to-date results, along with some perspective regarding the balance of 2017. Consistent with last quarter, we're also offering slides that show both reported and constant-currency results for both the quarter and year-to-date. You can view and follow along with these slides using the link on the Investor Relations page of our website.","The Molson Coors Brewing Company will deliver growth and long-term shareholder value through our first choice for consumer and customer approach, an expanded international business, the delivery of integration savings, ongoing cost savings, a more efficient global organization and a relentless drive for financial performance.","Our focus is to deliver both top and bottom line growth. Year-to-date, we've delivered worldwide brand volume growth, driven by our global priority brands. And on a constant-currency basis, NSR per hectoliter is up 2.4% as our portfolio premiumization has driven pricing and mix benefits around the globe.","To this point, in terms of progress, above-premium brand volumes increased 19% in the quarter and 20% for the year. And with this strong growth, our above-premium brands now represent 18% of our total volumes. At the same time, we've improved our EBITDA margins this year while investing in the business, with underlying EBITDA margins up by nearly 40 basis points year-to-date.","Our 2017 underlying free cash flow generation has been strong. We begun delevering our balance sheet and we're generating cost savings ahead of our plan, which has helped to mitigate higher-than-anticipated input cost inflation.","Now, a question I get when I talk with investors is, how we prioritize our top and bottom line goals? And the management team and our board address this important point as follows. We, first, will drive margin expansion and bottom line growth by delivering cost savings, ensuring efficient brand investments and paying down debt. Second, we will drive an improved top line through our commercial excellence approach, which provides a more sustainable source of profit growth over the medium to long term. This is our order of priority. Additionally, we will maintain our profit focus and our continued drive for total shareholder return through PACC or profit after capital charge, which is our capital allocation tool.","So, one year on from the close of the MillerCoors transaction, the bigger, better and stronger Molson Coors is driving a cohesive and distinctive First Choice commercial agenda, an expanded international business, a more efficient global organization and a relentless focus on financial performance, all underpinned by highly engaged employees who are playing to win.","And with that as a backdrop, I'll now turn over to Tracey to give financial highlights.","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. So, let's review our consolidated financial headlines for the third quarter versus our pro forma results a year ago, except for cash flow, which is reported on a year-to-date actual basis.","Our net sales decreased 2.1% due to lower financial volumes, partially offset by positive global pricing, sales mix, royalty volume and foreign currency movements.

Our global net sales per hectoliter increased 2.9% and 1.9% in constant currency, due to higher global pricing and sales mix.","Our worldwide total brand volume increased 0.6%, driven by strong growth in Europe and International, partially as a result of adding the Miller global brands business and also from growth in some of our core brands. Our global priority brand volume increased 2.4%.","Our financial volume decreased 4.8%, driven by the U.S. and Canada, which were adversely impacted by reductions in wholesaler inventories, contract brewing and brand volumes. These volume declines were partially offset by growth in both Europe and International due to added Miller International brand volumes as well as positive organic brand performance.","U.S. net income increased (sic) [decreased] 12.1% and underlying non-GAAP net income decreased 3.5%. Our underlying results were primarily attributable to lower financial volume, higher brand amortization expense, increased G&A costs and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by positive pricing and mix, cost savings and lower interest expense.","Our underlying EBITDA decreased 1.2% on a constant-currency basis. Our underlying free cash flow compared to actual results last year increased nearly 80%, driven by the addition of the other 58% of MillerCoors cash flows as well as lower cash tax paid for taxes, which were partially offset by higher cash paid for interest and capital expenditures.","We ended the quarter with net debt of $11.3 billion and we made an additional discretionary contribution of $200 million to our U.S. defined-benefit pension plan in the third quarter as part of our deleveraging goals, bringing our total cash contributions to approximately $310 million for the year. We remain committed to investment-grade debt ratings and reducing our leverage ratio to about 4 times on a rating-agency basis by the end of 2018.","Year-to-date, we improved underlying EBITDA by 1.8% in constant currency, with strong NSR per hectoliter growth and total worldwide brand volume up 1.6%.","And now, I'd like to share some regional highlights from the third quarter. In the U.S., we grew underlying EBITDA 0.8% on a pro forma basis in the quarter, resulting from increased domestic NSR per hectoliter, driven by higher net pricing as well as cost savings and lower MG&A expenses, partially offset by the impact of lower shipment volumes.","Overall, U.S. STRs declined 2.9% for the quarter on a trading-day-adjusted basis, in part because the U.S. volume environment remains challenging. Our domestic sales to wholesalers declined 7.2%, with nearly two-thirds of the gap between STRs and STWs driven by a reduction in distributor inventories and the rest due to one less trading day this quarter. Distributor inventories were reduced in the third quarter following higher-than-planned levels at the end of the second quarter.","Our year-to-date U.S. performance was similar to the third quarter, with a 2.2% increase in underlying EBITDA, 0.8% higher NSR per hectoliter and a 2.3% decline in STR volume. Despite the difficult backdrop, we made progress this quarter against our portfolio strategy, as Mark will share with you shortly.","Our Canada underlying EBITDA declined 0.5% in the quarter, driven by the impact of lower domestic volume, partially offset by positive pricing and foreign currency impact. On a constant-currency basis, underlying EBITDA declined 5.7% during the quarter. We drove strong NSR per hectoliter growth with a combination of price and mix benefits, but industry volume trends remained difficult, declining approximately 2%. Our market share grew slightly, driven by the return of the Miller brands, along with the strong above-premium growth from Coors Banquet and Belgian Moon.","Our third quarter Canada performance represents a trend improvement compared to earlier in the year, as year-to-date underlying EBITDA declined 10.7% in constant currency. Year-to-date NSR per hectoliter grew 2.6% in local currency, reflecting positive net pricing and mix.","Europe continued to produce strong results this quarter, with underlying EBITDA up 13.6%, driven by higher volume, positive sales mix and pricing, increased net pension benefit and favorable foreign currency. Constant currency EBITDA increased 10.4% in the quarter.","Brand volume increased 9.6% in the quarter, primarily due to the addition of the Miller brands and the transfer of royalty and export brand volumes across Europe from our International business. Even without this incremental volume, we continue to achieve growth from our offering of core and above-premium brands, which helped drive net sales per hectoliter growth during the quarter.","Our year-to-date underlying EBITDA, NSR per hectoliter and brand volumes in Europe grew strongly.","Underlying EBITDA for our International business was a loss of $1 million in the quarter, which represents an improvement from a year ago. Although the impact of hurricanes presented a significant challenge in several of our high-margin Caribbean markets, Coors Light continued to drive strong volume growth across Latin America and we have moved off the Miller transition service agreements and established platforms for growth with local partners.","Our brand volume increased 64.7% in the quarter and our third quarter net sales nearly doubled, driven by this higher volume, along with positive pricing, while reported net sales per hectoliter declined about 11.6% due to sales mix changes.","Our year-to-date underlying EBITDA for International improved from a loss of $4.9 million last year to income of $3.1 million this year, with brand volumes up 56.3% and reported NSR per hectoliter down 1.3%. Please see our earnings release for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the third quarter as well as our latest outlook and guidance targets.","Now, this quarter, we have the following updates regarding our guidance metrics. For the medium term, we continue to expect underlying EBITDA margins to increase an annual average of 30 to 60 basis points over the next three, four years. For 2017, we anticipate margins being in this range. Also, it is important to remember the cash tax benefits associated with the MillerCoors transaction, which were $109 million this quarter and are expected to be more than $400 million for full year of 2017.","We now anticipate total capital spending of approximately $650 million, plus or minus 5%, which is updated from $750 million, plus or minus 10%. Our underlying corporate net interest expense of approximately $360 million, plus or minus 5%, is updated from consolidated net interest of $370 million, plus or minus 10%. We have tightened our underlying effective tax rate range to 26% to 28% from 24% to 28% previously. We now expect our cost of goods sold per hectoliter for the International business to increase at a low-single-digit rate versus a mid-single-digit rate decrease previously stated.","We have raised our outlook for pension income to approximately $27 million, up from $24 million.","And although we are not changing our 2017 cost savings guidance of more than $175 million, we are pleased that these savings are coming in ahead of our original plans, because it is helping to cover inflation, particularly related to aluminum, which is higher than our expectations from earlier this year.","And at this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Tracey. I began this call by outlining our plans to drive total shareholder returns. And while the business environment, especially in North America, remains more challenging than anticipated, we believe our ambition to be first choice for consumers and customers will generate sustainable returns to our shareholders.","Our regional business priorities are clear and consistent. In the U.S., we remain focused on gaining segment share in premium, growth in above-premium and stabilizing our below-premium brand share. As you can see in this slide, this drives our consumer excellence approach and let me give you some proof points on our progress.","In premium, Miller Lite is well on track to become the number three beer brand in America. Strong momentum for Coors Banquet continues, as we expect 2017 to mark the 11th consecutive year of annual growth for this iconic American brand.","In 2018, Coors Light will relentlessly sharpen and strengthen its message as the World's Most Refreshing Beer, including some exciting packaging changes. Both Miller Lite and Coors Light are powerhouse brands. They gained segment share again this quarter, a trend that's extended for more than 21\/2 years.","In above-premium, Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy had a record-breaking year with volumes up low-double digits. We plan to build on this success next year through a number of packaging and Shandy innovations. Meanwhile, the Blue Moon family is widening its lead as the world's number one craft brand and Blue Moon Belgian White will continue its growth momentum with new SKUs and a focus on our legendary on-premise orange ritual, which is driving strong velocity and incremental tap handles across the U.S.A.","As per Nielsen, Blue Moon and Leinie's families accounted for 22% of the total craft beer volume growth year-to-date in the U.S. In regional craft, Terrapin, Hop Valley, Revolver, Colorado Native and Saint Archer are all growing at strong double-digit rates, well ahead of the overall craft segment, as we continue to integrate and expand geographically. And Peroni is growing and accelerating this year as we have enhanced the geographic reach of this aspirational import brand through improved market prioritization.","In below-premium, our new packaging types, price points and commercial focus are delivering a significant trend improvement in this segment, as per our strategy. We're also very excited about our brand additions in the U.S. As of October 1, we assumed the rights to import, market and distribute Sol, which further strengthens our above-premium portfolio.","And over the next few months, we'll bring to retail new high-potential brands with Arnold Palmer Spiked, designed to take share in the valuable alcoholic tea segment, and Two Hats, which is positioned to recruit new legal-drinking-age consumers into beer.","We're confident we have the right plans to achieve growth and we will continue to execute with relentless focus while looking for further build, borrow and buy opportunities for additional above-premium scale. Our customers tell us that our First Choice approach to sales and supply chain execution is working, with 14 supplier awards so far in 2017. We also continue to roll out our Building with Beer tool to new channels and customers. And these are the building blocks for long-term profitable growth for our U.S. business unit.","In Canada, our consumer excellence teams will remain focused on gaining segment share in premium, accelerating our growth in above-premium and stabilizing our below-premium brand share. Improving the performance of our two biggest brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian remains the number one priority and we're currently executing upweighted volume-driving activities with consumers.","Our above-premium performance, led by Coors Banquet, MGD, Belgian Moon and the Heineken portfolio, is accelerating with exciting further lift and shift brand additions planned in 2018 and we are executing a plan to simplify our below-premium portfolio with the launch of Miller High Life from late in the fourth quarter.","Since the introduction of Coors Banquet just a few years ago, exceptional consumer demand has propelled this brand at double-digit growth rates to become the most successful new product introduction in the past five years in Canada. Our performance across the portfolio will also be driven by customer excellence, as we lift and shift best practice sales tools from other regions. As an example, we've started to see improved volume performance from the early retail adopters of the Building with Beer program.","Our supply chain team continues to prioritize efforts on building and planning for the new British Columbia and Greater Montreal breweries. This work will create efficiency and flexibility in our supply chain, which we expect to unlock material savings in the medium to long term.","In Europe, consumer and customer excellence is driving the top and bottom line. We'll continue to drive a balanced portfolio approach as we strengthen our national mainstream brands and continue to premiumize by driving our craft portfolio, Staropramen, Coors Light and cider brands, along with the addition of the Miller brands and the royalty and export business in the region.","In July, we completed the purchase of Birradamare, a small Italian craft brewery, which provides us another opportunity in Italy and select export markets to build on our strong above-premium performance.","So far this year, our balanced portfolio approach across Europe resulted in maintaining our share-of-segment in our mainstream brands as well as generating double-digit growth in above-premium. One driver of successful portfolio premiumization in the quarter and the last few years is Coors Light's ongoing focus on ice cold Rocky Mountain refreshment, which is resonating powerfully with consumers, and Coors Light has grown to become our second-largest brand in the UK.","Above-premium Staropramen, outside of the Czech Republic, has also grown at strong double-digit rates across Europe, such that the total Staropramen family now exceeds 2.5 million hectoliters of annual volume in the region.","Furthermore, in what remains a fiercely competitive environment in the UK, our First Choice customer approach earned us the number one ranking in the Advantage Survey of multiple grocers for the second consecutive year.","Our International business will continue to leverage our strong global brands, partnerships and commercial capabilities around the world and focus our brands on the most attractive segments to grow Coors Light, the Miller brands and Blue Moon. Our customer teams have successfully rolled out a common segmentation analysis in all of our markets, Coors Light is growing at strong double-digit rates in Latin America and within a year of acquiring the Miller brands, we are currently launching the original white can packaging for Miller Lite to more than 20 markets globally.","The scaled-up International business requires upfront investments to grow our brands and as indicated earlier this year, our MG&A will be higher this year, funded by a step change in gross profit, as we lay the foundations for accelerating top and bottom line growth from 2018 onwards.","We expect our gross profit to be at the lower-end of the 2017 guidance range of $90 million, plus or minus 10%, principally due to the impact of the hurricanes in the Caribbean. We expect this impact of approximately $3 million to $5 million to flow through to the bottom line this year as we continue to invest in our brands. Clearly for 2018, we have plans to offset these negative impacts and continue to drive top line growth and improved profit performance from our International business.","So, in reviewing our performance in the third quarter as well as year-to-date, we're building traction against our strategic priorities, as indicated by delivering growth in global brand volume, net sales per hectoliter and underlying EBITDA margin.","In the fourth quarter this year, we anticipate less significant distributor inventory dynamics in the U.S. than we saw in the third quarter, along with a favorable comparison in Europe as we cycle a $50 million indirect tax provision in the fourth quarter of last year.","Despite challenging market conditions in North America, we remain on track to deliver our 2017 business and financial plans, exceed our original cost savings targets and cash flow goals as well as maintaining our investment-grade debt ratings.","One year on from the close of the MillerCoors transaction, the bigger, better and stronger Molson Coors is driving a cohesive First Choice commercial agenda, an expanded international business, a more efficient global organization and a relentless focus in financial performance, all underpinned by highly engaged employees who are playing to win.","Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks and slides will be in our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Dave Dunnewald and Kevin Kim will be available via telephone or e-mail to assist with any additional questions you may have regarding our quarterly results.","So, at this point, Rachel, we'd like to open up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning there. Just \u2013 thank you for taking the question. I wanted to explore more the free cash flow guidance. I know you capped it, but some of the components were actually more favorable. So, I was wondering if what led you to be more conservative and if that's related to commodity pressures that you saw throughout the beginning, I mean the first nine months. So, if you can help us like reconcile, again, the free cash flow guidance. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hey, Andrea. Thanks for your question. I'll let Tracey pick up the specifics. I would just remind you that we've already increased the free cash flow guidance as we've come through this year.","So, Tracey, do you want to just talk about the components and the cash flow performance?","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. So, hi, Andrea. So, free cash flow has got many factors that drive it and so for that reason, we do talk to our free cash flow guidance in the sort of plus and minus ranges. So, this quarter, we have reduced our CapEx guidance to $650 million, plus or minus 5%. So, we've reduced it and also tightened the range. This is partially due to identifying ways to achieve our cost savings and synergies while spending or investing less in our breweries and in our RT space (25:37) as we continue with our integration plan.","So, other than that reduction in CapEx, the odd effect is that obviously go into free cash flow. Earnings is one of them, but also a big driver is our working capital. So, for example, December is a big collections month and depending on the timing of our collections, that will play into our free cash flow.","So, we have got a strong track record of delivering our free cash flow. Year-to-date, our free cash flow delivery has been very strong, which has actually helped us to make an incremental $200 million contribution to our pension plan. So, we're very comfortable with our free cash flow guidance and we are confident that we will be within that range.","Operator","The next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you for the opportunity. Good morning, everyone.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hey, Laurent. How are you?","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good. There was a large difference between the sales to retailers and sales to wholesalers in the U.S. this quarter. So, are you back to a right level of inventory at wholesaler level or are you low and we should expect, I mean, a bump in Q4? And in general, what in your view is the right level of wholesaler inventory level in number of days?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yes. So, let me ask Gavin to pick that up against the backdrop of what's an ongoing aspiration to try and ship to consumption. So, Gavin, do you want to just talk about some of the specifics on as we've come through Q2 and Q3 and then how we see the balance of year?","Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Sure, Mark. Thanks and good morning, Laurent. The distributor inventory was reduced in the third quarter, because we had higher-than-planned levels at the end of the second quarter, which is something we called out on the last conference call. Distributed inventories into the third quarter were actually in line with the prior-year levels and that's for sure helped us improve our service to our customers as we've had almost 50% reduction in out of stocks compared to the last year.","I'd also make a point that the third-quarter STWs were negatively impacted because we had one fewer trading day in the quarter. So, year-to-date, our trading-day-adjusted domestic STRs are down about 2.3% and our domestic STWs are down 3.8%. And on a full-year basis, we would anticipate that these numbers would converge as we expect distributed inventories compared to the prior year increase a little bit by a day or two in support of the go-live of our Golden system ordering tool early next year.","Having said all that, we do expect full-year domestic STWs to be slightly below our comparable STR change, because the build-up at the end of 2016 was larger than I expected build-up at the end of 2017. So, a lot of detail there. I hope that answers the question.","Operator","The next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hey, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So, I wanted to take the opportunity to revisit Canada and cannabis in light of Constellation's deal announcement earlier this week. So, a two-part question, if you don't mind. Number one, kind of your current assessment of kind of the Canadian cannabis in terms of potential risk factors and how you're thinking about potentially supporting the business next year from an investment standpoint and then, secondly, your appetite to explore that market? Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Vivien, let me pick that up. And obviously, being based here in Colorado, we're very familiar with cannabis, as it's been legalized here. And clearly this is something that, as the whole legal landscape continues to change, we're actively working to understand. We have a team of people working on that. We're looking at potential impacts and\/or the opportunities associated with and we're developing a range of responses. Those will be discussed across our executive team and our boards and there'll be more to follow in due course. I don't think we have any statement beyond that to make at this point in time.","I think the important thing is to make sure we don't get caught in some kind of adrenaline rush. We're very thoughtful, very purposed and we're very clear on how we want to respond to both what could be challenges and what also could be opportunities. So, more to come in due course.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much. Your U.S. revenue per hectoliter I thought was pretty impressive, given a tough comp on that number, and you came in better than your primary U.S. competitor. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the drivers for revenue per hectoliter in the U.S., price\/mix and how perhaps you're improving your revenue management practices. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Robert, and I'll ask Gavin to talk the specifics. I mean, again, just a couple of context points. Gavin and his team are driving for, I would say, a very disciplined approach in our U.S. business. And then, clearly, we've made some changes in terms of our whole price promotion approach as we've come into 2017. So, I think they are important context points, but, Gavin, do you want to talk about the specifics and how you and the team are driving the NSR per hec?","Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Right. What I mean, Robert, as you know, a number of different factors go into our domestic NSR per hectoliter. We've got things that we've talked about in the past like FET drawbacks and freight and fuel revenue adjustments which we make, and then, of course, there's frontline pricing and product promotions and sales mix. I mean in the quarter, sales mix was actually negative because of the success that we had behind our economy strategy.","At the same time, we had tremendous progress on Blue Moon Belgian White, which continues to grow and grow strongly as one of the few large cross-brands in the country that is actually growing. And we had a record performance from Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy. So, pleasing progress on our above-premium portfolio. And, as Mark said, we put a constant focus on our revenue management initiatives and that's an ongoing effort.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. I mean, I think the only thing I would add to that, Gavin and Robert, is that right across our business, building our capability around pricing and revenue management is central to our whole commercial excellence approach. And if you look at the U.S., Canada and Europe, you're seeing very solid progress when you look at how we're managing one of the critical components of our top line and that's our revenue per hectoliter. So, I feel pleased with progress and we'll continue to focus in that area.","Operator","The next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Good morning, Judy. Normally, you're first on, Judy?","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I guess I was pretty slow this morning. So, Mark, I think in your prepared comment, you commented that management priority is first to focus on generating cost savings for bottom line growth. So, in light of what seems to be a much tougher industry environment for volume in the U.S. market, I just wanted to hear from you sort of what you're doing differently to generate more bottom line growth in the near term, not just the year-to-date EBITDA growth as relatively modest. And then just one clarification on the STW and STR kind of piecing together all of the things that Gavin said, are we expecting in the fourth quarter that STW to still be below the STR?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. So, let me just start with the second question. Gavin, do you want to just come back to Judy just on her question on STW expectations in Q4?","Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Sure, I can, Mark. Thanks. Look. Judy, I mean \u2013 as I said, that we would expect to be closer to shipping to consumption for the full year as we \u2013 so, those two will converge in the fourth quarter. So, put simplistically, STWs will probably be slightly better than STRs in the fourth quarter, yes.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Thanks, Gavin. And then, Judy, just on your first point, I mean just to clarify, I didn't say cost savings was our number one priority. What I said is when you look at our drive to improve both our top and bottom line, clearly, our number one priority is to make sure we're delivering on the bottom line both from a EBITDA margin expansion, absolute EBITDA growth and free cash flow focus and clearly getting our top line moving is a priority, second priority, because it's the best source of sustainable profit growth over the medium to longer term.","So, both of those things have got to work in tandem, but we've got to make sure we deliver on our bottom line financial performance. I'm encouraged by the fact that if you look at our cost saving plan \u2013 the three-year cost saving plan of $550 million over the three years, we're off to a great start in 2017. That's coming in stronger and faster than we had expected. We're not going update that cost savings guidance at this stage. If there was any update, we would do that as we kick off our 2018.","So, continuing to look for more efficient investments to drive our synergies, to further take costs out of the business, to drive productivity and efficiency behind our marketing expenditure is all important. And again, I've reiterated a number of occasions that myself and the management team are ensuring that we're retaining flexibility in our P&L.","If trading conditions are slightly tougher than anticipated, we have got the ability to flex our P&L to protect and develop our bottom line. So, there's quite a lot in there, but hopefully that gives you a sense as to what we're really driving against as a leadership team.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Financial. Please go ahead.","Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Also a U.S. question certainly for you, Mark, perhaps you too, Gavin, can you give us a sense of the budgeting dialogue as you head into 2018? And I'm particularly, of course, interested in the more discretionary items, marketing and other things that influence the top line as it does seem like flat is not a likely outcome in spite of the benefit you'll get from Sol and Arnold Palmer. So, just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about spending and whether that flat objective is still what you're thinking about.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","So, if I get behind your question, Mark, I think what you're asking is, are we going to spend a level irrespective of the impact that just drives flat volume? And again, I've been very consistent that we're not driving for flat volume and growth in the U.S. at any cost. We've been very clear that, that strategic ambition is, I think, very, very appropriate. We want our business back into growth in the U.S. Clearly, that was assumed against a backdrop of U.S. industry volume, which was probably closer to flat. U.S. industry volumes are not as strong as that.","So, it may take a little bit longer to get there. It doesn't change our strategic intent in the U.S. and you've seen a couple of indications as how we want to build out our portfolio with Sol and Arnold Palmer. We continue to work on other initiatives that hopefully will flow through as well in due course. So, just coming back to the specifics of your question, we'll spend a level that's appropriate to build our portfolio and also continue to drive strong financial performance in the U.S.","So, Gavin, I don't know whether you'd want to add any additional color around that.","Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","No, I don't. Thanks, Mark.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. So, Mark, hopefully that answers your question.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Bryan.","Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hi. Just wanted to follow up first on Mark's question just around volume and maybe Judy's question as well, in the third quarter, with the volumes coming in, and presumably STWs came in below what you were originally planning, was there much that you did during the third quarter to offset the volume shortage or did it all happen so suddenly, there wasn't much you can do to adjust and it would have been even much more leverage if there was more volume? Just trying to get a sense if there was any remedial actions you took in response to the volume declines. And then, I have a follow-up.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. So, I mean, I think it's fair to say we've come through both Q2 and Q3 and industry demand in the U.S. has been more sluggish than it was anticipated. And again, we've been consistent that we're retaining flexibility in our P&L to ensure that we've got levers to pull if volume isn't coming through as anticipated. We did that through the third quarter.","Clearly, some parts of a discretionary spend is more fixed than others if you're in big contract, for example, and sponsorships, but whether it's the U.S., Canada or our other business units, we retain that flexibility to offset any volume weakness. Clearly, you can do that up to a certain point. And I think we've demonstrated our ability to do as we've come through the third quarter. Again, that's very consistent with how we've thought about managing our P&L over the course of the last 12 to 18 months.","Operator","The next question comes from Tristan van Strien with Redburn Partners. Please go ahead.","Tristan van Strien - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Hi. Morning, guys. One for Gavin. I just want to ask about Sol distribution to U.S. In terms of what share of your current distributors actually doing Corona at the moment and to what extent is that a barrier? And maybe to follow-up on that, how are you thinking about Sol? Is this about getting distribution or is it more about velocity in the first few years? Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Tristan. Gavin, do you want to jump straight into that?","Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. I would say, Tristan, probably two-thirds to three-quarters of our distributors have Corona, roughly. Look, I think it's really early for us on Sol. We've only had it since the 1st of October. We've seen a lot of excitement from our distributors. We've seen it from our retailers. The transition is going well. It's been a tremendous cross-functional effort over the last few months.","We're working closely with Heineken in Mexico to ensure a smooth transition and we're excited about it. It's a very sessionable lager, it's got a great brand story. It's been around for a tremendously long period of time since 1899 and it fills a nice gap in our portfolio, which we've been under pressure to fill that gap on the Mexican portfolio. Now, we've got Sol and we're excited about it.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Gavin. Back to you, Rachel.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Please go ahead.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning, everyone.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hi, Pablo.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Look, just I wanted to stay within the one question limit, but maybe for Gavin, when we look at the STRs in the first half, they were down 2%, in the third quarter, down 2.9%. Can you just say \u2013 indicate at a portfolio level whether the three buckets worsen or something worse than more than the other? By the three buckets, I mean, you know your value brands, which I think is 30% of volumes, your mainstream brands, and then what, above mainstream. So, you can give color in that regard.","And then, related to that, whether \u2013 you can also answer the same question on a channel basis relative to the trends in the first half, did on-premise worsen more than off-premise? I suppose the hurricanes affect more on-premise business than off-premise. If you can comment on that please, Gavin. And if I may \u2013 I'm allowed, will like to ask a follow-up. Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","I'm not sure who's in charge with follow-ups, Pablo, but, Gavin, why don't you take that one?","Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Lots of questions within that one question limit mark. So, let me try and address it. Look, I mean our third quarter STR volumes were down 2.9%. It was a little worse than the earlier track record and I think it's safe to say that the industry had a tough summer. If you look at the various components in the three segments as you call it out, economy, we're very pleased with the progress we've made in economy. We've set our target two years ago that we wanted to halve the decline in our economy portfolio and maintain share and we've achieved that and in fact we grew share in the third quarter. So we're very pleased with that outcome.","Premium Light's had a tough summer for a variety of reasons. There was a significant discounting from a spirits point of view. On-premise traffic, to answer your channel-specific question, had declined during the prior year. Millennials are going out less. Latino shoppers changed their shopping behavior in 2017. We'd \u2013 certainly, we're impacted by the two hurricanes that we had, which would obviously have a short-term negative impact on the industry, but a more positive impact going forward.","And, again, on above-premium, we're making really nice progress on this. Blue Moon continues to grow and grow well. It's one of the few large craft brands in the country that are growing and we're pleased with that turnaround. Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy had a record summer. So, we were very pleased with the performance of that brand.","Our four craft companies are doing really well and we've got Peroni, which has got growth, which is accelerating. Redd's needs more work from our side, but Redd's Wicked is doing particularly well. And we're excited by our proposition with Hard Soda and with Sparkling sell-throughs and believe both of those brands and the category are here to stay. So, I think I covered most of your questions in that answer, Pablo and Mark.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","As you are trying to address the \u2013 as you're trying to improve the STR trends, I mean, obviously value and above-mainstream are doing better than before, right? But overall trends are not improving, they are worsening. So, the key issue boils down to Miller Lite and Coors Light and is that brand-specific or is it segment-specific? Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Well, we're very pleased with our performance on Miller Lite in particular. It continues to grow share and it's doing well in a declining segment. Coors Light has admittedly had a challenging year, but we believe we've got the right campaign with Climb On and we need to build on that campaign and bring the world's most refreshing beer more directly to the fore. So, we're very happy with our two offerings in the Premium Light segment, Pablo.","Operator","A follow-up question from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Financial. Please go ahead.","Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking that. Just clarity, I didn't catch it, Tracey, the CapEx coming down, order of magnitude $100 million. Were you saying that's a timing issue? Will it show up next year? And in the higher-end of the tax rate guide, I know this is a second question, but is that a view for the longer term? Should we just think about your tax rate being a little higher beyond this year?","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. Hi, Mark. So, yeah, just to recap on the CapEx, so this is not timing. We identified ways to achieve our cost savings and synergies and while spending less in our CapEx on both at our breweries and in the RT space (46:09). So, it is a reduction, a true reduction in 2017.","In terms of tax rates, so, yeah, the underlying tax rate is at the higher-end of what our previous guidance was. This is really relating to geography mix. A lot of our or most of our income comes from the U.S. at the higher tax rate. And then, also, we had some discrete items in 2016 and 2017. 2016 was favorable and 2017 was negative, which did drive that. In terms of going forward, we will update our tax guidance next year. So, I'll leave that until then, Mark.","Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very, very helpful. Thanks, Tracey.","Operator","The next question is a follow-up from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Actually, I have two, if that's okay. One is just a simple, and maybe I missed this, but did you quantify in the U.S. how much you think the storms affected your STWs and STRs?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","We didn't, Bryan, and I think if you're looking for comparisons or read-across from ourself against our biggest competitor, clearly, there was slightly different circumstances because our major breweries in the areas that were affected by hurricanes weren't really impacted in the same way. So, I mean clearly, there's been some impact, but we didn't call it out as a material impact on our volume performance.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. And there's no ongoing effect at this point, you're back to normal service levels in Florida. And I guess Puerto Rico would be the one area where that's not the case, but, for the most part, you're back to normal service levels.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. I mean, Puerto Rico, as you say, and some of the other Caribbean islands, which are important markets for us, are struggling to get back on their feet. And that's going to be kind of a longer path back to normality there. I think it's fair to say in the U.S., our distributors are working very hard to get back to normal service.","Gavin, I don't know whether you'd want to offer any color on that one?","Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, we're back to normal service, Mark, across the board. And from a brewery point of view, as you said, we have virtually no disruptions at our Fort Worth brewery and the Albany brewery was down for two days, but picked back up very quickly. So, no real impact.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks.","Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","The next question is a follow-up from Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Please go ahead.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Just for Tracey. So, I look at EBITDA margin expansion in MillerCoors in the third quarter, very impressive given that you had this operating deleverage with shipments being down 7%, but that's being masked, obviously, by this doubling of corporate expenses. So, two questions there. When we think about 2018, are those corporate expenses continue to be a headwind or are they going to be pretty much flat year-on-year in absolute terms?","And the second question related to all of this, we talk about shifting media from production to customer-facing and those type of things, but how are these corporate expenses, whether we call them centers of excellence or other things, how are they going to help the top line anyway? Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. So, Pablo, let me pick up on that. So, firstly, we haven't doubled underlying corporate expenses. There's a chunk in there's, it's about $35 million, which is really one-time cost related to some of the synergy capture. So, you've got to make sure that you reverse that out. And we were very clear earlier this year that if you look at our corporate G&A line, there's a difference of about $50 million year-on-year based on the guidance. About 40% of that is really a shift in costs around our business as we've moved some people who were working at a business unit-specific level to take on broader global jobs. So, that's just really a movement of money around our business.","Another slice of that relates to our global growth team and a big piece of that investment relates to the Miller trademark globally, so as we pull that brand into our business. I mentioned on the script that we're changing the packaging on Miller Lite in 20 countries concurrently. That's a massive effort. And we're driving that centrally, because it's the fastest way to kind of deploy that kind of change in the marketplace.","So, the investment behind the Miller trademark will remain in that corporate cost. So, again, that doesn't become an incremental headwind as we go into 2018. I think, clearly, we've got start-up costs for things like a World Class Supply Chain 2.0, introduction of global shared services and again, they are now embedded in our cost structure for this year and are not a headwind as we go into next year.","We'll update on our guidance for 2018 corporate G&A in February, but we'll be working very hard to make sure that that's kind of contained, at worse, flat and more to follow in the specifics around that in due course.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Pablo.","Operator","The next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hey, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you for the follow-up. Just in terms of your comment, Mark, on the exploratory committee or working group on candidates, one, can you tell us when that was established? And number two, do they have any early insights into U.S. dynamics, because you've got three years of overlap in the U.S. and more than that even? And then, even in \u2013 like a \u2013 a market like Nevada, we just opened up July 1, the early indications at least from the tax revenue office in Nevada is that liquor tax did come in below expectations. Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Vivien, are you sure you haven't changed jobs, because this is a high focus for you, that's for sure.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Well, I do believe in the interaction. I think you know that. Yeah.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. I mean I'm not going to get into when we established the team, et cetera. I mean, clearly, as we look across the landscape of both opportunities and challenges, where we've got people working on a whole variety of fronts, which includes this front, so I don't think I need to go into the detail on that.","Clearly, in Colorado, we're actually seeing the beer industry relatively healthy. So, it's very difficult if you look across different states in the U.S. to get a consistent read. So, we've got a team of people working on it. There's a range of insights are being developed. And as I've said, we'll work through the implications, both good, bad or indifferent, and more to follow on that. I just don't want to be drawn on it. I think it's competitively sensitive.","And as I've said, we've got to be deliberate and thoughtful about how we respond in due course. So, more to follow in due course and I really don't think there's any value in getting into any of the detail beyond that at this stage.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you very much. I think we all understand that the summer was particularly weak. Our contacts with distributors over the last couple of weeks suggest that business picked up reasonably nicely in October in the U.S. Can you confirm that?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hey, Robert, I think you're aware we stopped giving kind of short-term volume guidance. I mean, you've got access to the news and data the same as we are. So, we're not going to be drawn on a few weeks' trends. I just refer you to the publicly available news and data.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Let me try something else then. Going back to revenue per hectoliter, you also had pretty strong results in Europe on the revenue per hectoliter side and I don't know how much of that is kind of on an organic basis or if there were sort of one-time items or things that weren't comparable, but perhaps you could give us some insight there.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Sure. And I'll let Simon talk to the Europe performance, which has been consistently strong as we've come through 2017. So, Simon, do you want to talk about the portfolio approach and the balance that you're leaving for across the P&L?","Simon Cox - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Thanks, Robert. So, I mean your question was \u2013 I think, Robert, pointing to, is it one-off or is it underlying? If you looked at Q2, I think (55:18) was up 3.7% and in this quarter, it's up 4.1%. So, we're posting fairly consistent results.","We've done that really through a mix of price and mix. So, our pricing was up 1.7% in the quarter. Our mix is up 2.4%. And you would have heard us talk, I think, very consistently now about our attempt to premiumize our portfolio. So, if you look at our premium brands, they were up double-digit in the quarter. If you look at our craft brands, they were up high-single digit.","Cider continues to work well for us and generally as a premiumization opportunity in the UK. Our core brands performed well and they were competitive in the marketplace. And we have been thoughtful about our value brands and actually they declined at low-single digits in the quarter, which we are very comfortable with.","So, if you put all that together, we think that's the right sort of pricing, mix and volume curve, because, as you know, we also grew volume strongly and we continue to try and do that in Europe and manage with a balanced portfolio, investing behind our brands, premiumizing our portfolio, driving craft and making sure that we're not fueling any move towards value in some of our Eastern European markets.","That worked well in Q1, worked well in Q2, worked well in Q3. So, I would describe it as an organic underlying trend that we're leading for. And to your very question, there aren't some funnies or some (56:50) one-offs in there.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","That's terrific. Congratulations on the great result.","Simon Cox - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thank you.","Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Robert.","Mark R.

Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars.","As you know Anheuser-Busch InBev announced yesterday, a further extension of it possible offer for all of the outstanding share capital of SABMiller and there has been some related press speculation that mentions Molson Coors. As a matter of policy Molson Coors does not comment on market rumors and we will not be discussing AB InBev SABMiller situation on our call this morning, including during the Q&A session at the end. We will devote our time this morning to our third quarter financial results, then outlook for the balance of 2015.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Dave. Hello and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call. And we really appreciate you joining us today. With me on the call this morning, I have Gavin Hattersley, the CFO of Molson Coors and the CEO of Miller Coors, Stewart Glendinning, our Canada CEO, Simon Cox, our CEO of European; Kandy Anand, our International CEO; Sam Walker, our Chief Legal and People Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Controller; and obviously Dave Dunnewald, you just heard from our VP of Investor Relations.","In the third quarter our worldwide volume increased 0.7% driven by strong growth in Europe and International. Underlying earnings were lower due to unfavorable foreign currency, increased brand investments and the termination of our Miller brands agreement in Canada and the Modelo brands in Heineken brewing contracts in UK earlier this year.","We increased gross margins and consolidated business bases driven by the U.S. and Europe. We invested more in our brands in all over businesses except international, where lower marketing was primarily due to the substantial restructuring of our China business this year.","In the quarter we continue to transform our portfolio toward above-premium, craft and cider. We expanded the depth and reach of our international brands in fast-growing markets and we increased our commercial capability. We also continued to drive meaningful cash generation and disciplined cash and capital allocation.","More specifically, in the U.S. Miller Coors achieved its best quarterly performance in premium lights in three years as well Coors Light and Miller Light built momentum and grew share of the segment. We continue to roll out Coors Light's new visual identity and Miller Light launched this tiny bottle and grew quarterly volume for the second time in the past year.","Outside of the U.S. and Canada Coors Light grew strongly, and we'll soon launch our largest global brand into the highly profitable Columbian market. Miller Coors is the ninth acquisition of the majority interest in the Saint Archer Brewing Company, a San Diego based brewer of award winning craft sales and this acquisition will further strengthen our global craft portfolio which grew nearly 10% in the third quarter. The integration of the Rekorderlig cider business into our UK and Ireland portfolio has gone well and our global cider portfolio grew a low single digit rate in the quarter.","We continue to restructure our business to ensure we're fit for the future, including the restructuring of our China business the planned closure of the Miller Coors Eden brewery next year following the closure of our Alton UK brewery in May of this year. And importantly we've reached an agreement to sell our Vancouver brewery which will allow us to build a more efficient and flexible brewery in British Columbia.","Other third quarter performance headlines are as follows, worldwide volume increased 0.7% driven by Europe and International and despite the impact of the termination of the Miller brands agreement in Canada and the Modelo brands contract in the UK. Coors Light volume grew 1% globally driven by nearly 20% volume growth outside of the U.S. and Canada.","Our net sales per hectoliter decreased 2.3% in constant currency, driven by mix changes within our Europe and International businesses, including the impact of terminating the Modelo brands and Heineken contract-brewing agreements in the UK. And we grew net pricing in the U.S., Canada and Europe in local currency.","Constant currency net sales increased 0.7% due to higher volume in Europe and International along with the positive net pricing in Canada and Europe. By adding an effect of foreign currency, reported net sales declined 12.9%.","Underlying pre-tax income of $295.4 million was down 10.9% but decreased 1.7% on a constant currency basis, with the key drivers being increased brand investment and the well documented contract terminations. Underlying after-tax income decreased 4.3% driven by unfavorable foreign currency, higher brand investments and terminated contracts. And these factors were partially offset by higher volume positive net pricing a lower tax rate and the results of the cost savings initiatives.","U.S. GAAP net income from continuing operations increased $49.4 million from year ago due to lower brand impairment charges this year in Europe. We incurred impairment charges of 275 million this quarter related to some of our Europe brands including the Allen brand because of continued economic and competitive challenges and increased discount rates across the region we have also changed the accounting treatment of these brands from investment lives to definite lives which we expect to increase amortization expense by approximately $50 million per year based on current foreign exchange rates.","Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $420.2 million, a 10.4% decrease from a year ago, driven almost entirely by unfavorable foreign currency investments. Year-to-date underlying EBITDA was $1.104 billion than 7.7% from a year ago. We also continued to implement our four year 1 billion stock buyback program with $50 million of cash used in the third quarter to repurchase more than 689,000 flat e-common shares from July through early October. Please note that in August we committed another $50 million of cash to be used for stock repurchases during the fourth quarter under accelerated share repurchase program. ","In terms of regional highlights U.S. underlying pretax income decreased 7.5% due to lower volume including a reduction in distributor inventories versus the year ago and continued softness in our economy portfolio along with higher investments and brands and technology as discussed on our last earnings call. These factors were partially offset by positive net pricing and mix supply chain cost savings and lower brewing, packaging, material and fuel costs. One significant news item from Molson Coors was the appointment of Gavin our CEO in September. Gavin has quickly taken actions across a number of areas to energized and focus the entire organization. Coors Light and Molson Light both grew shares of segment and improved volume trends in the third quarter versus the first half of this year. And meanwhile Miller Light and Coors Banquet grew volume and overall market share. The U.S. portfolio of transformation towards the above premium segment continues with lead brands Blue Moon, Belgian White, Leinenkugel and The Redd\u2019s Family each growing the volume. ","Through Tenth and Blake, the leading craft grow in the U.S. Miller Coors expanded its growing craft portfolio with the acquisition of Saint Archer Brewing which was completed in October. We are excited about the growth opportunity offered by this Saint Archer brands which represent a variety of sales that complimentary to the current Tenth and Blake portfolio. Including some outstanding Shandy [ph] ales. The U.S. team also announced the plan closure of its Eden, North Carolina, brewery. In Canada underlying pretax income decreased 5.4% in constant currency primarily due to the negative impact of terminating a Miller brands agreement at the end of March of this year. The fact of lowered volume in the quarter was partially offset by positive pricing and substantial cost savings including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency underlying earnings declined by 18.9%. Canada sales to retail our STRs decline 4.9% primarily due to the termination of the Miller contract. Excluding the Miller brand our STRs decline by 0.5% of 1%. In Coors brands Coors Light and Molson Canadian volumes declined in the quarter. But trends improved versus the second quarter as we rolled out the advertising and commercial executions for Coors Light. And about premium Coors Banquet delivered strong volume and share growth in the third quarter as did Mad Jack Apple Lager, Molson Canadian Cider and Strongbow Cider along with our Granville Island and Creemore craft brands.","In Europe, underling pretax income increased 7.1% in constant currency driven by higher sales volume positive pricing and lower costs. Despite the loss of the Modelo and Heineken contracts in the UK this year and the release of our regulatory reserve last year. Europe underlying pretax income decreased 6.7% in the quarter due to the impact of unfavorable foreign currency. Sales volume increased in 9 of 11 countries and for 8 of our 11 lead brands in the region. Excluding the loss of the Modelo brands the UK market would also have increased volume in the quarter. Equally encouraging areas of Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia that were affected by severe flooding a year ago continued to recover. In Coors brands Carling trends improved, primarily on the year and on Staropramen Bergenbier grew volume and segment share in their core markets. Our craft and above premiums portfolio continued to perform well with Coors Light, Doom Bar and Cobra [ph] all achieving strong growth in the quarter as did above premium Staropramen outside of Czech Republic. ","Our international business again delivered double digit volume growth in the third quarter driven by triple digit volume growth in India and double digit growth for Coors Light in Latin America. India\u2019s growth was due to strong performance of our existing India business and our acquisition of Mount Shivalik Breweries earlier this year. Due to higher volume in India and Latin America along with lower MG&A we ended the quarter with a $600,000 improvement and international's underlying pre-tax loss versus a year ago, or a $1.8 million improvement excluding the impact of foreign currency movements.","Now, I'll turn over to Gavin to give additional third quarter financial highlights and perspective on the rest of 2015, Gavin.","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks, Mark and hello, everybody. Underlying free cash flow for the first three quarters of 2015 totaled $476.8 million which represent a $289.3 million decrease versus the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower underlying after-tax income, negative foreign currency and less benefit from working capital changes, including higher cash paid for taxes.","Our year-to-date free cash flow included the following factors, $461.5 million of operating cash flow and $279.9 million of net add-backs for our discretionary UK pension contribution in January. Settlements of interest swaps the cash impact of special items and Miller Coors investments in businesses. Investing cash outflows included $208.3 million of capital spending. Our underlying free cash flow included $1.088 billion of cash distributions from Miller Coors and $1.145 billion of cash invested in Miller Coors. A detailed reconciliation of our underlying free cash flow is available in our earnings release distributed this morning.","Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $3.002 billion and cash and cash equivalents totaled $393.6 million, resulting in net debt of $2.609 billion, which is lower than a year ago, primarily driven by foreign currency movements and debt pay down. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.","Looking forward to the balance of 2015, the following full year forward guidance is unchanged from the last quarter. Although we\u2019re not changing our 2015 underlying free cash flow target of $550 million plus or minus 10%. We currently expect our results for the year to be in the upper half of this range and that is between $550 million and $605 million. And we expect our 2015 MG&A expense in Corporate to be approximately $110 million.","We are revising the following full year guidance. First we now expect capital spending to be approximately $275 million down from $300 million previously largely driven by foreign currency movements. Second we expect our consolidated net interest expense to be approximately $110 million versus $120 million previously driven by favorable foreign currency and interest rates. Third, we now expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be approximately $300 million in 2015, including our 42% of Miller Coors contributions at today's exchange rates. This was revised from the previous guidance of $300 million to $320 million primarily due to foreign currency movements. Fourth, we now anticipate 2015 pension expense of approximately $23 million, including our portion of Miller Coors. And fifth, we now anticipate that our full year 2015 underlying effective tax rate will be in the range of 14% to 16% down from 18% to 22% previously due to the favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions and other tax benefits. After this year, we still expect our underlying tax rate to be near the low end of our long-term range of 20% to 24% for the next few years, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions.","In 2015 cost outlook, we now expect our full year cost savings to be near the upper end of the $40 million to $60 million range that we've been targeting. By region we continue to expect Europe cost of goods sold per hectoliter to decrease to the low single digit rate this year in local currency and International business cost of goods sold to decrease at a low double digit rate per hectoliter. We now expect Canada cost of goods sold per hectoliter in local currency to increase at a low single digit rate down from the annual guidance of mid-single digit last quarter, driven by lower brewery and distribution costs. And Miller Coors now expects 2015 cost of goods sold per hectoliter to be approximately in line with or slightly below the year before. This is previous guidance of in line. This change is driven by lower packaging commodity and fuel costs.","And finally regarding the profit and cash headwind from foreign currency that we expect this year, if we apply foreign exchange rates at the end of October to our results for the fourth quarter of 2014, it would reduce underlying pretax earnings for that period by approximately $10 million and the impact on cash would have been even larger. By adding the foreign exchange impact on pretax results for the first three quarters of this year, we arrive at a full-year foreign currency impact of nearly $70 million versus our 2014 consolidated pretax results.","At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap up and the Q&A. Mark?","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Gavin. In addition to the foreign currency headwind that Gavin just mentioned our results in the fourth quarter of this year will continue to be affected by determination of major business contract which we anticipate will have a full year 2015 profit impact of $40 million pretax. Additionally, we plan to significantly step up our portfolio investments in the balance of this year particularly in the U.S. and Canada. These investments will have a negative impact in the fourth quarter bottom line results, but we expect them to provide benefits long term as we focused on delighting our consumer and our customers to ensure we are the first choice brewer in the geographies and segments where we choose to play.","Regionally in the U.S. we are driving three key priorities. Job number one is to transform our portfolio and reignite volume growth we are targeting getting our volume trends to flat in 2018 and growth in 2019 for the first time since Miller Coors was formed, and to that we have three focus areas. Firstly, taking share and growing our American Light Lagers Coors Light and Miller Light. As part of the Coors Light overhaul [Audio Gap]. Secondly, continue to the premimize portfolio and further developed [Audio Gap], examples include the successful launches of Blue Moon White IPA and Leinenkugel Grapefruit Shandy this year as well as the acquisition of some [Indiscernible] excellent craft brand and suddenly we've began the process of simplifying un-clarifying our below premium portfolio offering. ","Job number two is to improve our commercial capability including winning in non-premise and increasing the relevance of our brands in this critical channel, where brands are built, and job number three is to ensure that our cost base is competitive and fits for the future including closing our Eden brewery next year. Consistent with our priorities we intend to invest significantly in our brands and information technology in the fourth quarter including beginning of fuse of enterprise system ramp up starting of this Shanondor brewery. We continuously expect our U.S. underline operating margins for full year 2015 to be relatively flat versus prior year. We would be disciplined, decisive and accountable and remain laser focused on growing our business in the United States from transforming then Miller Coors portfolio. ","In Canada we continue to invest in our core brands and above premiums including craft, imports and flavored malt beverages. In core brands in the advertising campaign and increased focus on commercial execution on Coors Light are showing early positive signs particularly in our highest share regions. Initial consumer response to our latest advertising created for Molson Canadian has been also been positive. In the fourth quarter we are again investing aggressively in these programs. And above premium our portfolio is benefiting from the strong performance of Coors Banquet Mad Jack Apple lager, Rickard\u2019s Radler and Molson Canadian Cider brands along with Dos Equis, Tecate, Sol and Strongbow. Belgian Moon is also performing well after three months in the Canada market. In Europe determinate Modelo and Heineken contracts Miller Coors continues to present a headwind in the fourth quarter as well in the amortization expense for the brands we impaired this quarter and moved to definite life.","In some Europe markets we continue to see consumer migrations to all new brands and increased competitive pricing. We\u2019ll continue to invest in a core brand portfolio across Europe to ensure that these brands remain relevant and contemporary for our consumers. In the third quarter the majority of our lead brands grew volume including Ozujsko, Staropramen, Bergenbier and Borsodi. In the balance of this year our Europe theme will be ramping up for the full repay attrition of the Staropramen brand into the UK starting on January the 1st. ","Additionally, we are implementing significant new initiatives to further improve the efficiency and efficiency of our European operations and provide more resources to invest in driving top line and bottom line growth. As the most recent example we announce earlier this week that we have made a proposal and entered into consultation process in the UK to close our Burton South brewery and consolidate production with another recently modernize Burton North brewery by the end of September 2017. ","Our international business is focused on attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant currency basis and accelerating our overall growth and expansion in new and existing markets. We\u2019ll continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light develop Coors 1873 in Latin America, including introducing new brands to consumers in the high potential Columbia market. We will also continue to build in Staropramen's momentum in greater Europe and rapid growth on our existing India business with the growth from our newly acquired Mount Shivalik Breweries operation.","Finally, here are the most recent volume trends reached of our businesses early in fourth quarter. In U.S. through October 31st STRs decreased at low single digit rate. In Canada through October 31st SPRs were down low double digits excluding the Miller brands last year our Canada SPRs decreased a high single digit rates. In Europe, October sales volume was down mid-single digits partially due to loss of the Modelo brands in the UK. ","Our international sales volume including royalty volume increased at double digit rate in October. Now as always please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and frames could change in the weeks ahead.","So to summarize our discussion today, in the third quarter, we grew our worldwide volume and constant currency net sales, increased our gross margins and invested significantly more in our brands. Underlying earnings, however, were lower due to unfavorable foreign currency and the termination of contracts this year.","There has been a great deal of news flow around the global beer category in recent weeks. Notwithstanding this, our organization remains focused on our strategy of driving brand-led profit growth, meaningful cash generation and disciplined cash and capital allocation. We remain resolute on utilizing PACC as our key business-decision framework, using our cash to reward investors and ensure a healthy balance sheet, reducing costs to provide front-end firepower, and making smart investments to deliver value enhancing growth opportunities. Our strategy is underpinned by highly engaged, passionate and inspired people with the ambition to be First Choice in the eyes of our consumers and customers.","Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just first the few personal comments about Gavin, as he transitions really to the CEO role within MillerCoors. This is Gavin's 15th quarterly earnings call. And I think everybody has come to recognize this transparent and productive relationships with both our analysts and investor communities. He's been an integral part of the Molson Coors strategy and progress over the last three years, and the good news is that Gavin will remain a member of our executive team here at Molson Coors.","So, Gavin, from me, just a big personal thank you and best wishes as you become 100% focused on MillerCoors as CEO. You go with our best wishes, Gavin.","Gavin Hattersley","Thank you.","Mark Hunter","In order to help Gavin focus his full energy and attention on the MillerCoors business, I'm pleased to announce that our Europe CFO David Heede will be stepping into the global CFO role on an interim basis as we work to finalize the selection process for Gavin's successor here at Molson Coors. David has more than 30 years of leadership experience in many areas of our company and he's played a central role in a very successful integration of our Central Europe and UK businesses. David will have a strong global finance team supporting him. And I have every confidence that we'll not miss a beat in this critical area where we complete the global CFO search process.","And then finally, as usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, 1 pm Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via the recorded webcast on our website.","So, at this point, Leanne, we'd like to open it up for questions please. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Vivien Azer","My first question has to do with the price mix in Europe, I totally appreciate that the loss of Modelo is a drag there and you called out lower contract brewing volume and negative mix. But I'm trying to kind of get a sense of what's happening kind of underneath that given your commentary on some intensified promotional activity and then a tougher competitive landscape. So, if you could just elaborate on price mix in Europe, that'd be helpful. Thank you.","Mark Hunter","I'll ask Simon to pick up on that. So, Simon, do you want to just talk to a little bit more of the detail with regard to our Europe performance?","Simon Cox","Yes, sure. Thanks for the question Vivien. When you look at our price mix, pricing across Europe is at actually 0.3% positive across the region. And so all the drag on net sales to -- net sales revenue perhaps was to do with mix. And actually you more or less correctly called out the two main drivers of that during your commentary. It is very much to do with the loss of Modelo brands in the UK and the fact that the contract manufacturing revenue is also put into our net sales revenue line but doesn\u2019t actually attract any of the hectoliters because obviously it's not our own sales. And that has quite a significant impact on the overall NSR per hectoliter. So, there isn't too much of the color to add. But we're actually very pleased with the way the brands are performing across, both the UK and the Central European region. And so it is really pricing marginally up and mix driven by Modelo and contract manufacturing is the drag.","Vivien Azer","And just a follow-up on -- is it fair to say that more muted price increases are reasonable to anticipate just given the broader macro environment in the EU?","Simon Cox","As you know, we don't give forward guidance on pricing. But historically if you look into our performance over the last three quarters, we've issued a sensible balance I think between volume and pricing. We're orientating our portfolio much more towards maintaining strong positions in our core brands and ensuring that in pockets of value growth like cider, craft beer in the UK, premium brands, Staropramen growth in Czech Republic. These are all things that can support overall pricing growth and that's where we're orientating our portfolio. So, that's been working well for us I think over the past three quarters. And that's where we're going to focus on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Shackleton from Nomura. Your line is open.","Ian Shackleton","Obviously, Gavin set out some targets of volume growth for MillerCoors going forward. I just wonder what assumptions around that were on pricing mix and whether we assume the lower number that you\u2019ve been reporting today, I just have a 1% as sort of guideline, we should be expecting the future on the higher number that we've had into last couple of years?","Mark Hunter","I let Gavin get into the detail, but obviously, the principal response is we don't give any guidance with regard to future pricing. But Gavin, do you want to talk a little bit more about ambitions in terms of getting back to flat volume?","Gavin Hattersley","We do want to be flat in 2018 and grow in 2019. We\u2019ve got a very strategy and very clear plans to achieve that. It requires significant focus on our Premium Lights brands with Coors Light and Miller Lite and we are very pleased that we in the third quarter had the best performance in those two combined brands in over three years. And it does require us to transform our portfolio more into the above-premium and get really specific about what we\u2019re doing with our economy brands.","Mark Hunter","More broadly, I mean our medium-term guidance in terms of pricing hasn't been updated for our U.S. business. So, no color over that.","Ian Shackleton","Just a quick follow-up, I mean you've gone through last couple of years surprises and quite a few this quarter on the tax rate on the positive side, i.e., so it was coming beneath what we\u2019d expect and we\u2019ve got another example of that today for the full year. Could you just give us a little bit more granularity what is helping particularly in this quarter to bring down that rate?","Gavin Hattersley","Look, I mean the one thing we can't predict is when we\u2019re going to resolve uncertain tax positions. They are uncertain for a reason and obviously we can't predict when we resolve them. And we again resolved some uncertain tax positions in the third quarter. And having said, so the large change of the reduction to 14% to 16% is related to that. And we haven't changed our longer term guidance of 20% to 24%. And in the shorter term, for example next year, we expect towards the lower end of that, that remains unchanged. If you want to get a feel for the level of uncertain tax positions that are still out there, formal SEC filings of the Qs would give you some guidance on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Judy Hong","So, just on Canada, Mark, I think I may have missed the October STR number excluding the Miller brand?","Mark Hunter","Yes, it's a high single digit decline. ","Judy Hong","Just any reason, why it was so low sequentially?","Mark Hunter","Stewart, do you want to give a little bit of a flavor as to what you're seeing in Canada coming through the third quarter and any commentary around the start of the fourth quarter?","Stewart Glendinning","Judy, overall the market was much healthier in the third quarter, benefiting from some warmer weather. Our portfolio was in a much better place. Going into the fourth quarter, nothing has changed in that portfolios, it's still robust, activity levels strong. Really the only big item in the -- in October to point out is that there is one less trading day in October but other than that there is nothing materially that\u2019s going on in the marketplace. ","Judy Hong","So, maybe just a calendar issue, as opposed to\u2026","Mark Hunter","The other think I would additional is, as per my prepared remarks, if you look at our STRs for the quarter, when you exclude the loss of the Miller brands, the volume is down about 0.5%. So on underlying basis, I would describe our volume performance as reasonably solid.","Judy Hong","And then Stewart, just maybe if we can get an update on your brewery optimization plan in Canada. And we've heard a little bit during the quarter in terms of the Vancouver and I think potentially maybe an update on the Montreal side. So, what are some of the updates that you can provide us with respect to the recent announcements and how you would plan to optimize and the margin impact that would have in 2016 and beyond?","Stewart Glendinning","Okay, Judy but not a lot we can say obviously on margin since we don't give any forward guidance. But good news coming out of Vancouver for sure, that was an old brewery that was going to consume a bunch of capital and we have been able to lock-in contract for sale of the property. Broadly the sale of that property will fund the construction of a new brewery. And when we move into that brewery, we should expect to see lower going forward CapEx and the lower operating costs on that brewery. In Montreal, we have a similar study underway to understand whether we should invest in the current brewery or to invest in new build. And I won\u2019t have the answer to that question until likely early next year. Overall, I think we've got a very strong plan for reshaping the supply chain in Canada. And of course that's one of the things that's driving the estimates of savings that the Gavin's provided to the Street.","Judy Hong","Stewart, if I can just follow up, if I think about from a capacity standpoint in Canada, it seems like because you are building a new brewery in Vancouver, the capacity numbers really don\u2019t change much in Canada despite some of the volume declines that we've seen in the last few years. Can you just comment on why you wouldn\u2019t necessarily take out more capacity and looking at the breweries in Canada?","Stewart Glendinning","Look, I never actually spoke to the capacity to conclude whether we would take it up or take it down. What I will say is we are going to build the brewery to provide the best operating efficiencies for our company. And more importantly, what you get with a new brewery is the ability to drive a more flexible brewing. If you look at what's going on in the market today, it's important to be able to provide a wide range of brew sizes to accommodate the smaller brew stuff. I think we\u2019ll gain a lot of from that. But you can rest assured that rightsizing our capacity is a key part of our plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","John Faucher","Question for Gavin. Gavin, you talked about -- when you talked about sort of the changes in the U.S. business, particularly on Coors Light with the focus I think on a new agency but sort of the same Rocky Mountain heritage. So, is that a sign that the message isn\u2019t the issue, it's been the delivery of the advertising or the amount of the advertising; is there some lesson learned there that we should glean from the fact that the campaign idea generally stays exactly where it is?","Gavin Hattersley","I would say couple of things there. Obviously changing an agency not going to change the direction of the Coors Light brand. It\u2019s the total package as it relates to Coors Light. So, our new brand identity which we launched in the second quarter and which really got completely rolled out in the third quarter is part of that being extraordinarily well-received by both distributors, customers and retailers a lot. And so we\u2019re pleased with the performance in Coors Light which has been driven largely by that over the last couple of quarters. And as David said on this morning's call, Coors Light\u2019s performance in the third quarter was the base that we've had for quite some time.","And our new above the line marketing campaign will be focused on Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment. There will be a different way of expressing that than you have seen in the past. And thirdly, we are putting significantly more money behind Coors Light. And we\u2019ve put large -- meaningfully more behind Coors Light in the third quarter and we\u2019re seeing the impact of that. So, I wouldn\u2019t point to just any one thing but a total package of what we're doing on Coors Light, John.","Mark Hunter","John, its Mark here. The only thing I would add to that is if you look across the global footprint of Coors Light, Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment isn\u2019t up for debate. That's what the brand stands for that's its absolute bedrock. And we consistently dramatize that across all of the market that we execute the brand. And clearly to Gavin's point, how we dramatize it in the U.S. is going to be evolved but that will still be very much of a bringing to Light Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment in a way that's contemporary relevant and distinct. And David Kroll this morning spoke to the need for us actually to develop campaign ideas in the U.S. that have got longevity so that we can get behind something and drive it over the medium to long-term as opposed to changing creative ideas on a annual or biannual basis. The Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment is absolutely in the heart of what Coors Light stands for.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philipp Gusinde from MUFG. [Ph] Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Actually I had a two-part question, if I may. The first one is with regard to the accelerated share repurchase program. Do you have any commitments beyond the $50 million that you talked about for the current quarter? And then the second question, trying to be very respectful of Dave's question, or request not to talk about any potential activity in the space, but if I may perhaps ask a more holistic question, just talking a bit about capital allocation as you have talked about in the past. If you were to state a once in a lifetime opportunity, have been Molson and Coors family ever talked about then potentially contributing new equity if that's were to be required in order to maintain an investment grade rating?","Mark Hunter","Let me try and do with both of those questions. On the first question on the share repurchase program, we\u2019ve set out $1 billion repurchase program over four years but the majority of that towards the latter half of that program. We've confirmed what we've done in the third quarter and what's likely to happen in the fourth quarter. On our next earnings call, we will update you with regard to progress on that program. So, there is no new news with regard to our share repurchase program.","With regard to capital allocations, I don\u2019t think this call is a time or place to get into discussions about what the preferences are of the Molson or the Coors family would be. Under certain circumstances, the families have been long term investors in the beer industry, we are talking centuries here, not just quarters. And they've said that they\u2019re very committed to the long-term vitality of our organization. So, as opportunities come and go, we'll consider them appropriately with our board but those will be confidential board discussions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan Spillane","Just two questions, one is, in Europe, I think in the press release, there is a mention of, there was a reserve that was released during the quarter. Could you give us a sense of just how much of an impact that had on profit?","Mark Hunter","Do you remember the specifics? They\u2019re released last year. Simon or David do you have that\u2026","Simon Cox","We didn't give the specific number last year but we said that it was a factor in our results in third quarter of 2014, but no specific number\u2019s been provided.","Bryan Spillane","And then, I guess more broadly, just as we're thinking about free cash flow, this year we had a few items that negatively affected free cash flow. I guess as we start thinking forward from here, is the Vancouver brewery -- I guess I understand that it's going to be net cash neutral once you sell the property and build but is there a period of time where that will potentially be a drag on free cash flow? And then also in terms of pensions, with interest rates still having not moved yet, or just a way the markets have behaved, is there anything that we should be thinking about in terms of pensions that might cause you to have to contribute more, again I guess next year?","Mark Hunter","Gavin, do you want to take that?","Gavin Hattersley","Sure. Look Bryan, we haven't given any guidance for 2016 and beyond on cash flow at this stage. I guess the only point that I would make is that if we did build a brewery, it would be out of multi years; you don't necessarily just build it in the one year. And I guess that's what our concern that particular point. As far as pension contributions are concerned, I think our requirements under the UK Pension Plan which for Molson Coors remains a biggest pension cash contribution area, quite clearly laid out in our financial filings. So, you can have a look at those, there Bryan. And as know, we made a one-off contribution this year, which impacts the contributions that we have to make in the IPOs. It's very clearly set on.","Mark Hunter","Gavin, just one other additional perspective. Bryan, if you look back at the changes we made our UK supply chain over the course of the last five years, I mean we've fundamentally transformed and modernized our manufacturing facilities in the UK. And we've managed to that all within what you describe as a pretty normal capital envelope within our business. We expect to be able to do something similar in Canada looking at the cash that we secure from for example Vancouver brewery [indiscernible] under requirement to continue to modernize our brewery network in Canada. So, I think our track record speaks to our ability to modernize our manufacturing facilities and do that in a way which is within a recognized capital envelope in the business.","Gavin Hattersley","One other think I'd like to just clarify there, Bryan. You said that the proceeds and the investments would offset each other but in terms of how that's disclosed in cash flow, for the proceeds from the sale of the Vancouver property would not be included in underlying free cash flow but capital investments would.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Nicolas. Your line is open.","Mark Swartzberg","A few questions on Canada, one just a technical one, the down high single digit comment at the Miller impact for October, what would that number be if we have it on an equal selling days basis?","Gavin Hattersley","Yes, I agree with the question. Stewart, I'll be impressed if you know the answer to that, but Dave, do you want to\u2026.","Dave Dunnewald","I do, it's somewhere around 5% Bryan. But yes -- so it's right around 5% is the technical answer.","Mark Swartzberg","Okay, down 5 for the month of October excluding the Miller impact on an apples-to-apples days basis.","Dave Dunnewald","Apples-to-apples, one less trading day equates to about 4.9 something but rounded to 5, if you want.","Mark Swartzberg","And then, total brewing capacity in Canada, have you disclosed what that figure is? Can you disclose what the total brewing capacity across the country is?","Dave Dunnewald","To my knowledge, we haven't disclosed that. I think the more important thing is to recognize that as we reshape up the supply chain footprint for the country, of course you're going to be looking at what our needs are, what kind of brewing we're going to be undertaking and where best to brew it and capacity will be wrapped into that.","Mark Swartzberg","And then, I guess the last on Canada, all of you have this goal of improving above premium craft and cider performance. I think you've been very clear about how that looks here in the U.S. and there's some real progress there. I think there's progress there in Canada as well. But could you talk a little bit about more about how well positioned you are presently for that and what the trends in that component of Canada look like?","Mark Hunter","Mark, was that an MCBC question or Canada specific question? Sorry, you broke up a little bit just\u2026","Mark Swartzberg","Yes, specific to Canada. I think we've good visibility on how you\u2019re positioned here in the U.S. but with Canada, I was wondering how you\u2019re positioned and how the outlook against that objective is?","Mark Hunter","I mean just in headline terms, Stewart and his team are really driving three big change initiatives across our Canadian business, partially transforming our supply chain and making sure that we really are fit for future, secondly ensuring our cost structure, again as competitive, and thirdly, we're working very hard on transforming the portfolio which includes driving further into above-","premium and cider, craft et cetera. So, Steward, do you want to just give a color on the progress that made over the last couple of years and the momentum is building in that particular part of the portfolio?","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, certainly Mark. I mean all of the changes primarily that have taken place have been at the top end of the portfolio. We've been -- as you know, we have The Six Pints team here, which is our equivalent in Canada of Tenth and Blake. That group with craft brands [ph] Granville, and Creemore have been driving those brands across the country, so craft portfolio growing rapidly. We also recently introduce Belgian Moon into a Canada, that reception\u2019s been very warm with strongly encouraged by the rate of sale that we've seen in those where we\u2019ve brought that brand into customers. And then of course, the biggest launch of all, so far has been Coors Banquet which we brought in at a premium price position and that's better than one share of the market now. So, I would say those are the big ones. On the apple side of course, we\u2019ve got two very quick growing ciders which is the Strongbow and own Molson Canadian Cider and then this year, we launched Mad Jack, which is an apple flavored lager. So, all of those apple variants are performing strongly, all of them playing at the upper end of the market.","Mark Swartzberg","And when you think about your view of where the consumer\u2019s going against those opportunities, is it right to think, tuck-ins and innovation and just good spending in plant against the brands that already exist there, that's how you think about executing further against that goal?","Stewart Glendinning","I think that makes a lot of sense. So I will say, it's an important just to understand the dynamics across the broad market. There are consumer needs, at every segment of the market and to exclude one at the expense of the other doesn't make sense. Premiums are huge out of our business and so that remains an important focus in innovation as well.","Mark Swartzberg","Okay, great, thank you Stewart, thanks everyone. ","Stewart Glendinning","No, I'm sorry, Bryan, I meant to mention one part of the market also. As you know, this year we've also broaden the types [ph] of brands and Dos Equis and Sol had the nice portfolio and they're also growing well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. Your line is open. ","Rob Ottenstein","I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about your plans and strategy for Coors Light outside of the U.S. and Canada and maybe perhaps start by giving a some sense of what percentage of Coors Light volumes are outside of U.S. and Canada; how much they grew in the quarter and on average roughly how they\u2019re positioned pricewise outside of North America, what percentage of mainstream price in place?","Mark Hunter","So let me just give you a little bit contexts and I\u2019ll ask Simon to talk about the Coors Light progress in the UK and Ireland and then Kandy to talk more broadly about our other international markets. We don't offer percentage of our volume, relating the proportion of Coors Light outside of North America but it's into millions of hectoliters. So, I'll give you a sense of scale. And through the quarter, we grew at 20%, outside of the U.S. and Canada. So, it's a meaningful presence as growing very rapidly. So clearly within the UK and Ireland that brand has been there now for approximately a decade. Simon, do you want to just give a flavor for the momentum you're seeing and Kandy can talk more broadly, outside of the UK and Ireland.","Simon Cox","Yes, thank you for the question. And Coors Light has been performing as one of the strongest performing brands in the market for over three years and this quarter is no exception, we've seen double-digit growth of course like in the UK and Ireland this quarter. And basically, it\u2019s just a brand that continues to work extremely well for our consumers and on for our customers and for us.","In terms of answering your question around pricing index, it tends to be priced above the mainstream. So on the on-trade, if you walk into a typical English pub, you will see calling on the bars, mainstream price, and you will Coors Light generally at a 5% to 10% premium to that. That's a similar trend into UK off-trade although of course that's a little bit more volatile, based on what tends to be quite a discount driven off-trade market. But generally, it comes under premium to mainstream pricing and in the UK and Ireland is continuing in really strong growth for us. So, very important brand in that portfolio and doing extremely well.","Rob Ottenstein","And in terms of India, can you give us a sense of what the organic volume growth was there?","Mark Hunter","Rob, why doesn\u2019t Kandy give you a flavor for what\u2019s happening with Coors Light and talk specifically about the India performance. Kandy?","Kandy Anand","As you know Coors Light has been engine of growth for us for several quarters in the last couple of years. It continues to grow very strong double digits with a big focus on Latin America. It grows on the back of an earlier answer that Mark gave, on Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment. We are very much focused on that positioning. We think it relies for marketing programs, placements of coolers and working with our partners and sales execution. And we see that that growth continuing in the future. We also spoke about our excitement about our launch in Colombia which actually happens next week and they are doing that in partnership with CCC which is a joint venture of CCU in Postob\u00f3n and Colombia. So that\u2019s on Coors Light overall. In the international business, we've also -- you asked about India. On India, we\u2019re very pleased with our progress this year. Our overall volumes have grown triple digit along with the acquisition. But just on that organic basis on the royalty [ph] acquisition our volumes are also growing double digit there. So, at this point of time, we are still under three steps that we spoke about during the June conference and continue to drive our business through that.","Rob Ottenstein","Kandy, in terms of the Coors Light pricing in Latin America, is it also a 5% to 10% premium to mainstream or is it a higher premium there?","Kandy Anand","Typically it's been a higher premium in those markets. We tend to have a pricing of on the average 20% above the mainstream. It of course varies by market, maybe a little bit less than one and more on the other but on the average we target 20ish pricing premium. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open.","Brett Cooper","Hi, guys, a few questions. In the past, you've confirmed impairments in Europe were a function of specific brands. And then if you look at the portfolio in total, the appreciation in value of non-impacted brands offset the brands where impairments have been taken. Can we get a similar confirmation today, given the impairments in the quarter?","Mark Hunter","Sorry Brett, could you just -- there was a lot in that question. Could you just repeat that again, please, apologies.","Brett Cooper","Specifically, when you guys take impairments on the European brand, its brands specific and what you've done in the past it's that if you look at the value of Staropramen, it offsets the impairments you've taken. And since we have a new impairment today, I just wanted to make sure that that\u2019s still the case. That the sort of the total portfolio, if you will is better off in terms of intangibles than when you bought the business?","Mark Hunter","That is correct. So, we've seen very strong performance as you pointed out, for example on Staropramen. So, that's correct yes.","Brett Cooper","Should have asked this morning but in the U.S. the business transformation expenses that you looked on 2016, those continued -- sorry, in the end of 2015 here. Those continue as you go through the transformations through 2017; is that correct or should they abate for any reason?","Gavin Hattersley","Yes. That's correct, Brett. We will continue to incur meaningful BT expenses in 2016 and also in 2017 although it\u2019s slightly lesser.","Brett Cooper","And then finally, in Canada, is actually according to your cost savings that you guys are delivering at Molson Coors excluding your share of the MillerCoors piece are coming from Canada and you are beginning to see some traction on what you are doing at Coors Light. Is there a need or desire to reinvest more of those savings to get the business back to share stability? Thanks.","Mark Hunter","Well. Brett, I think we laid that in the last quarter that our intention was to invest incrementally through the second half of this year. And I mentioned already on the call the economic engine of our businesses is the strength of our brands. So, we remain committed to invest to build our brand equity and our brand health. We outweighed our investment in Canada through the third quarter and continue to plan to do the same in the fourth quarter, so very much in line with the guidance that we gave around the second half of this year. Building the strength of our brands in Canada is an absolute priority for us.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic from SIG. Your line is open.","Pablo Zuanic","Good morning everyone. In your prepared remarks, you said that you are planning on working on simplifying and clarifying your value brands. So three questions on that. One, can you elaborate on what do you mean by that? I think simplifying means SKU cuts but clarifying the message? So that's one. Two as you define them, value brands would be percentage roughly of your volumes or revenues? And three, again roughly on Coors Light EBIT margin versus some of these value brands, roughly what the difference here at the gross margin level or EBIT margin that would be very helpful? Thank you.","Mark Hunter","Hi, Pablo. A lot of detail in that, Gavin, did you manage to get that...","Gavin Hattersley","I'll give a shot and if I miss anything, then somebody will correct me. From a simplification point of view, it does go to SKU simplification. We have a lot of brands in that segment and we have a lot of different packages. So simplifying that is a key focus area for us. In terms of what brands are in there, brands such as Miller High Life which has been around for over a 100 years and it's very clearly differentiated. We have brands like Keystone in that area and then we have regional brands such as Hamm. And so, making sure that we have a very clear positioning and message behind those brands is the work we're doing. The differentiation from a price point of view is it can be varied but if Coors Light and Miller Lite are in a 100, economy can be anywhere from anywhere from -- in our portfolio from 72% to 90% of that. And then from an overall portfolio point of view which I think was your other question, it is around a quarter of our portfolio would be in the below premium segment. I think I\u2019ve covered a little.","Mark Hunter","Yes, the only other thing that Pablo asked was about our margin comparisons that we incurred like in the rest of portfolio and that\u2019s not information we go in the public domain other than the that\u2026","Unidentified Analyst","Understood, but just a follow-up, thank you for that. So in terms of target of reaching flat volumes, I think it was 2018 or 2019; how is this particular strategy supposed to play out? Is this a headwind or a tailwind in terms of volume growth? Because of you are guiding SKU simplifying that would mean potentially a reduction if you can clarify that please? Thanks.","Mark Hunter","So, I mean the [indiscernible] portfolio would definitely be a headwind for us in terms of achieving that that means we need to perform better on premiums and above-premiums, no question about that.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Andrew Holland from Societe Generale. Your line is open.","Andrew Holland","Just we haven't really talked so much about Europe. And I just wanted to try and distinguish between your performance in the UK and your performance in Central Europe. So, just first looking at price mix which you say was down in Europe. Is that entirely attributable to the UK and the loss of Heineken and Modelo? And can you tell me if price mix was actually up across your Central European countries, is number one. And something similar for volume, you said was up in 9 out of 11. I guess that one of two volumes were down would have been in the UK again because of the loss of Heineken and Modelo brands, can you confirm that that is the case and give us an idea of volume ex the UK?","Mark Hunter","I\u2019ll ask Simon to talk in a little bit more detail in a second. I did cover in my prepared remarks the fact that if you strip out the loss of the Modelo volume in UK that UK business would have been in volume growth. So that was one of your specifics. We don't tend to breakout price or volume information on a market-by-market basis. So Simon, is there any additional color that you would offer you Andrew\u2019s question?","Simon Cox","I think you've probably broadly covered it there, Mark. I mean it's a similar answer to the first question I gave that the reduction in NSR per hectoliter is all driven by the two factors of the Modelo brands in the UK and the loss of contract manufacturing. And just to explain that again, obviously the revenue from contract manufacturing goes into our net sales revenue line but the volume denominator perhaps [ph] because only pertains to our owned brand sales, so it's actually quite a significant headwind in terms of the overall what we call out as mix. If you strip that out and if you strip Modelo out, then you'd get a more positive picture. So, that's really the main explanation there. Pricing across Europe and UK was pretty similar and pretty solid. And then as Mark just alluded to, if you remove the impact of the Modelo brands, then the UK business would have also slightly grown it's volumes. So, if you triangulate that against a 5% overall increase in volume and that gives you an idea of the relative performance of Central Europe which was very positive through the quarter.","Mark Hunter","So, I think that concludes the questions. So, just on behalf of the team here at Molson Coors, I'd like to thank you all for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. And just as a reminder Dave Dunnewald will as usual be hosting a more detailed call at 1'o clock this afternoon, Dave? Yes, 1'o clock Eastern Time. So, many thanks for your interest in Molson Coors Brewing Company. And we look forward to catching up with all of you through the fourth quarter and beyond. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. "],"14965":["Molson Coors Brewing Co.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors. Mr. Hunter, please go ahead.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thank you, Anita. Hello and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors Earnings Call, and thank you for joining us today. With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors we have Tracey Joubert, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, the CEO of our U.S. business; Fred Landtemeters, our Canada CEO; Simon Cox, the CEO of our Europe business; Sergey Yeskov, the CEO of our International business; Lee Reichert, our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller; and Kevin Kim, Global Director of Investor Relations.","Today, Tracey and I will take you through our plans to drive long-term total shareholder returns, highlighting our second quarter results, and also discuss our outlook for the business. As usual, we're offering related slides on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now, you may have seen a press release from our Canadian business earlier today announcing that Molson Coors Canada has entered into a definitive agreement to partner with The Hydropothecary Corporation, or HEXO, in Canada to form a stand-alone joint venture focused on non-alcoholic cannabis-infused beverages for the Canadian market. We will discuss this opportunity in the outlook section of our prepared remarks, but first let's focus on the Q2 results for the company.","We were pleased with the sequential improvements in the second quarter for top and bottom line results. Our full year underlying cost savings and free cash flow guidance has not changed, despite ongoing industry demand challenges in the U.S. and Canada, and inflationary pressures. While we are aggressively addressing our volume performance in North America, performance in our Europe and International businesses was strong in the quarter.","More specifically for the quarter, our underlying EPS growth of 10.6% reflected positive global net pricing, cost savings delivery, lower marketing spend, and a lower tax rate, while we continued to strengthen our balance sheet with lower net debt. Our results also include the unfavorable timing effect of the revenue recognition accounting standard, which reduced underlying EPS by $0.05 for the quarter. This timing difference is largely expected to reverse as a benefit in the fourth quarter. Across the organization, our teams exercised flexibility in the P&L with lower MG&A spend across all business units.","In the U.S., our results reflected headwinds from the overall beer industry, as well as continued negative impacts from the Golden brewery system implementation. Although the industry faced another tough quarter due to a challenging April and impact of holiday mismatches, we are dissatisfied with our overall market share trends and will continue to focus on reinvigorating Coors Light, while maintaining the strong improvements in Miller Lite and continuing to accelerate performance in above premium to improve both top and bottom line results.","Coors Light lost segment share and we are working to turn that trend around by more boldly leveraging The World's Most Refreshing Beer campaign. Our branding efforts will focus on creating a deeper connection with our existing consumer base and recruiting the next generation of legal drinking age consumers, while our sales teams will focus on regaining distribution and maximizing retail support.","Improved premiumization efforts will focus on growing our national and regional craft portfolio, improving our FMB performance through innovations, such as Arnold Palmer Spiked and Henry's Hard Sparkling, and continuing to take share in the import segment led by Sol and Peroni.","The Golden brewery system implementation and ongoing freight carrier constraints negatively impacted our volumes, accounting for nearly 1% of volume declines in our U.S. business unit this quarter. The Golden installation has now stabilized and we are brewing, packing, and shipping beer in line with expectations. We're now prepping for the successful transition of the five additional system implementations for the remaining U.S. breweries over the next 12 months. As previously disclosed, we expect a gross profit tailwind in the second half of this year as distributors build up inventories ahead of the next system implementation. As a result, we expect our second-half volumes will reflect better STWs than STRs.","In Canada, while brand volumes reflected sequential improvements, excluding the impact from the revenue recognition accounting standard, NSR per hectoliter was down 1.4% on a constant-currency basis. This was driven principally by negative mix shift within the portfolio, as our simplified below premium strategy delivered ahead of expectations. Through the balance of the year, we'll address our NSR per hectoliter performance through our premiumization efforts by focusing on improving performance in the Premium segment and driving growth across our powerful above premium portfolio.","In our Europe and International businesses, despite various year-over-year headwinds, our teams produced strong results driven by balanced top and bottom line growth, as we grew our core national champion brands and above premium brand volumes in Europe, and improved profitability from focused brand performance in our International business. Going forward, we plan to maintain positive momentum and we remain focused on delivering underlying EBITDA of $20 million to $25 million this year in our International business.","Across all of our markets, premiumization of our portfolio remains an important element of our strategy and our above premium brands accounted for 21% of our portfolio, up from 20% last year. Despite strong growth from Europe and many of our above premium brands, total above premium volumes declined by 1%, driven by softer volumes in the U.S. and Canada. Continued premiumization of the portfolio while strengthening our mainstream brands remains central to our approach.","Our teams are leaning in to deliver on our commitments for the full year by finding opportunities to earn more, use less, and invest wisely. Guidance for free cash flow of $1.5 billion, plus or minus 10%, this year is based on continuing to drive our First Choice commercial excellence initiatives, as well as our disciplined approach to cost savings, flexibility with discretionary spending, and our continued focus on driving working capital efficiencies.","More specifically, we have a strong track record of delivering on cost savings and our $210 million guidance for the year remains unchanged. Additionally, as discussed in New York, we expect our results to benefit from additional cost mitigation efforts, particularly in the second half of the year.","Our ability to flex the P&L with our discretionary spending to protect the bottom line is another reason that we are committed to our cash plans this year. Future results prove this as MG&A spend was down substantially across all business units. For example, MG&A spend in the U.S. was down over 5%. We plan to use this same disciplined approach across our business throughout the second half of the year.","Now before I turn the call to Tracey to give more detail on the quarter, I also wanted to highlight the recent release of our Our Beer Print Sustainability Report, which demonstrates our company's positive impact in our communities and their environment against our 2025 goals. As a leading global brewer, 14 of our global sites have already reached zero waste to landfill, and we have plans to improve this across all of our brewing and major manufacturing facilities as part of our larger Beer Print efforts.","So with those headlines, over to you, Tracey.","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. Our number one priority for 2018 is delivering on our bottom line, which includes generating cost savings, delivering strong free cash flow, and strengthening our balance sheet via debt paydown.","Our earnings release provides more details on our cash generation and cost savings guidance, which has not changed. We are reiterating our underlying free cash flow guidance of $1.5 billion, plus or minus 10%. We're also reiterating our cost savings guidance of $210 million in 2018, which is part of our three-year target of $600 million.","Recent cost inflation makes delivering these savings particularly important this year. As we discussed at our Analyst Day, our teams are also focused on additional cost mitigation efforts, which will not be reported within our cost savings number, but should benefit our second half profitability.","Also, while we are reiterating our annual COGS per hectoliter guidance in Canada, Europe and International, we are now raising our U.S. guidance to up mid-single digits for the year. We do have hedging programs in place that provide partial protection from the well-documented inflationary environment this year. However, the inflationary environment remains a headwind, including volatility from aluminum costs and the Midwest Premium, and incremental pressures from the freight carrier market in the U.S. In the current volatile cost environment, our teams are working to mitigate the impact of these increases.","Before I share consolidated highlights, I would like to remind you of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which we'll refer to as revenue recognition for the remainder of the prepared remarks today. As outlined in our earnings release, this is expected to have no significant impact in net income for the full year, but will cause some timing differences between quarters, impacting some year-over-year comparability for net sales and MG&A primarily in the U.S. and Canada this quarter.","For example, revenue recognition negatively impacted EPS by $0.05 this quarter and $0.06 on a year-to-date basis, but this timing difference is expected to flip back as a benefit in the fourth quarter.","As highlighted in our earnings release, underlying EBITDA decreased 2.6% on a reported basis and 3.8% on a constant currency basis, driven by lower financial volume, higher cost inflation, and the unfavorable timing impact of revenue recognition, partially offset by positive global net pricing, cost savings, and lower marketing spend.","U.S. GAAP net income increased 28.6%, driven by unrealized mark-to-market gains on our commodity position versus losses a year ago, cost savings, lower income tax expense, and lower interest expense, partially offset by lower financial volume, higher input cost to inflation, and the unfavorable timing impact of revenue recognition.","Net sales decreased 0.2% on a reported basis and decreased 1.9% in constant currency. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis decreased 0.3% in constant currency and increased 1.9% on a reported financial volume basis. Worldwide brand volume decreased 2.4% and financial volume decreased 2.1%. Global priority brand volume decreased 4%.","And now on to regional highlights. In the U.S., underlying EBITDA decreased 7.2% versus last year, driven by higher COGS, particularly aluminum and freight, lower volumes, negative sales mix, and the unfavorable impact of revenue recognition, partially offset by higher net pricing and lower MG&A expenses.","Top line pressure this quarter was driven by brand volume decline. However, strong NSR per hectoliter growth reflected sequential improvements and strong Q2 pricing. Despite volume and COGS headwinds, we demonstrated flexibility in the P&L with a 5.2% decline in MG&A.","In Q2, we gained share in Premium Light, led by Miller Lite's increasing segment share for the 15th consolidated quarter. Coors Light continued to underperform and, as Mark noted, is a significant focus area. Declines in our above premium portfolio were driven by underperformance from the Leinenkugel shandy family and the tough competitive environment in the FMB segment, with volume losses from the Redd's franchise and Henry's Hard Soda. However, we are competing better within the growing hard seltzer segment through Henry's Hard Sparkling and have more than doubled our share of the category since Q1.","Arnold Palmer Spiked is beating expectations and is the top-selling new FMB in 2018 according to Nielsen. Crispin is up double digits on the strength of Crispin Ros\u00e9, and in craft Blue Moon Belgian White remains by far the number one craft brand in the U.S., accounting for about 8% of total industry craft volume in the country. Strong growth from our regional craft brands continued to outpace the segment.","In imports, the marketing and packaging overall of Sol has led to a new momentum for the brand, which is up triple digits to-date per Nielsen. Peroni also continued to gain momentum, growing volume for the 15th consecutive quarter and is the top 10 growth brand on premise according to Nielsen.","In below premium we continued to grow share of segments in Q2 led by the Keystone family. Keystone Light remains among Nielsen's top 10 growth brands, while the Steel Reserve Alloy Series has accomplished six consecutive quarters of double-digit growth.","In Europe, our Q2 underlying EBITDA improved by 18.2% on a reported basis and 11.7% on a constant currency basis due to favorable gross profit impact, spend efficiency, and timing of brand investments and the partial reversal of bad debt provisions, as well as the addition of the Aspall business.","The top line benefited from above premium brand and national champion brand growth, as well as World Cup consumption, as volume grew 2.9% coupled with NSR per hectoliter expansion of 1.5% on a constant currency basis. In addition to strong top line performance, lower marketing investments also helped drive the double-digit increase in the bottom line.","As previously discussed on our Q1 call, top and bottom line results were impacted by the increased commercial investment we made in our First Choice Agenda during 2018. In addition, we have chosen to adopt recently-revised industry guidelines for calculating excise tax payments in one of our markets, which reduced our Europe NSR per hectoliter by low single digits.","Our Canada underlying EBITDA decreased 5.1% in Q2 on a reported basis and 7.8% on a constant currency basis, driven by revenue recognition, negative sales mix, and lower volume, partially offset by marketing investments. The top line reflected a 2.4% decline in brand volume, with declines in Western Canada and Ontario, coupled with the net sales per hectoliter decline of 4.5% in constant currency during the quarter. Excluding the effect of revenue recognition, NSR per hectoliter would have decreased 1.4% due to negative mix. The bottom line reflected benefit from lower MG&A spending and lower COGS per hectoliter.","The premium segment declined mid-single digits, but Coors Light continues to improve its market share trajectory, confirming the positive impact of our renewed marketing and sales focus behind the brand. While the above premium and craft segments declined, growth came from continued success of MGD and Belgian Moon, while the newly acquired Trou du Diable is broadening its reach in Qu\u00e9bec.","Strong growth in the Value segment, which represents about a fifth of our volumes in Canada, was driven by a recent addition actions to refocus the portfolio, including the very successful launch of Miller High Life.","Regarding International, underlying EBITDA versus last year improved $7.4 million in the second quarter, driven by positive net pricing, positive brand and geographic mix, along with higher volume and lower MG&A costs. These factors were partially offset by the loss of the Modelo brands in Japan.","The top line benefited from a 3.8% improvement in net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis and a 0.6% increase in brand volume in the quarter. Positive volumes were driven by organic growth in our focus markets, partially offset by the loss of Modelo contract in Japan. The bottom line also reflected improved COGS per hectoliter performance, in addition to lower MG&A spending levels in the quarter. Looking forward, we will ensure our business continues to generate strong free cash flow as we strengthen our balance sheet and deliver on cost savings.","And finally, I want to reiterate our discussion from our Analyst Day around capital allocation priorities. Returning cash to shareholders over the next two years includes the following. First, we are committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating and expect to achieve approximately 4 times leverage on a rating agency basis by the end of 2018. After that point, our plans are to achieve about 3.75 times leverage on a rating agency basis around the middle of 2019. After which our board currently intends to reinstitute a dividend payout ratio target in the range of 20% to 25% of annual trading underlying EBITDA for the second half of 2019 and ongoing thereafter.","Deleveraging and our dividend are our current priorities and as we pass these two stages, we will then consider future uses of cash, which may include continued deleverage, investment behind growth initiatives, and share repurchase activity in the context of our capital allocation framework underpinned by Profit after Capital Charge, or PACC model.","At this point I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Tracey. All of our business units are focused on a series of commercial excellence drivers that will help build our top and bottom line. These include building extraordinary brands, strengthening customer excellence, and driving disruptive growth. Within building extraordinary brands, we're concentrating on energizing our core brands and accelerating the growth of our above premium and craft portfolio, and building the scale and footprint of our global brand portfolio.","Within strengthening customer excellence, we're scaling up and driving the Molson Coors Advantage program across all of our global sales teams, and this approach is designed to drive category value that both our customers and Molson Coors can share. And finally within driving disruptive growth initiatives, we're focused on expanding our portfolio beyond beer, driving a leading edge digital and e-commerce agenda across every aspect of our business, and accelerating the pace of our growth in international markets. All of these commercial activities are underpinned by strong insights and analytics to refine and amplify their impact.","Now, as referenced earlier, the proposed joint venture in Canada announced this morning by Molson Coors Canada is consistent with the company's overall strategy to drive disruptive growth in our markets globally. As we recently shared in our New York Analyst Meeting, we're growing our global non-alcoholic beer portfolio and have recently invested in diversified brewed beverages in the U.S., like the Bhakti chai tea company and Clearly Kombucha.","With Canada breaking new ground by federally legalizing cannabis this fall, Molson Coors Canada is in a unique position as one of Canada's leading beverage companies to pursue opportunities in this nascent, but rapidly expanding consumer segment. By creating a separate stand-alone venture, with a trusted partner who shares our values and commitments to doing business the right way, Molson Coors Canada can drive disruptive growth, while remaining focused on its core beer business. More details will be provided in due course once the transaction closes and the joint venture is formed. Let me now return to our regional outlook.","In the U.S., as we said in Q1, we will build distributor inventories in the second half of the year as we prepare for further brewery system implementations. Also, we will continue to drive our portfolio strategy of building distinctive brands across all segments to meet the needs of American beer drinkers. We have an urgent focus on improving Coors Light trends through bolder execution of The World's Most Refreshing Beer, and sharper feature and display activity, while continuing the strong share trends for Miller Lite through a distinctive competitive positioning.","Additionally, we expect FMB and cider performance to benefit from incremental volumes from Arnold Palmer Spiked distribution, labor and PACC innovations from Henry's Hard Sparkling, and introduction of slim cans for Crispin Ros\u00e9. More broadly, in above premium we're accelerating our import share with Sol and Peroni, while strengthening the Blue Moon franchise and rapidly scaling our family of regional craft breweries.","In Europe, we're encouraged by the strong start to the summer selling season. Our teams will continue to use a balanced portfolio approach by building on momentum from International growth of Staropramen outside of the Czech Republic, Coors Light, and our craft and cider portfolio. Additionally, we will remain disciplined with retail execution and optimization of our brewery network and infrastructure.","As discussed on our Q1 earnings call, when modeling the results of Europe, remember that we currently anticipate a low single-digit negative impact per quarter to NSR per hectoliter for the remainder of the year, as we've chosen to adopt recently revised industry guidelines for calculating excise tax payments in one of our markets.","In Canada, the commercial excellence teams will continue to focus on strengthening the portfolio by stabilizing a premium brand performance, accelerating the growth of our above premium portfolio, and simplifying our offering in the Value segment. In premium, Coors Light is our top priority and we expect to improve brand activations and promotional intensity with an emphasis on refreshment to drive feature and display. Our premiumization efforts will drive an acceleration of the growth of our key import brand Heineken, as well as our MGD and Coors Banquet brands.","Trou du Diable, our most recent Canadian craft addition, is broadening our footprint in the world of craft in Qu\u00e9bec and is delivering strong results. We've also lifted and shifted Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy and Henry's Hard Soda from the U.S. And the recent addition of Coors Edge, a new non-alcoholic offering, is complementing Heineken 0.0 in this rapidly growing segment.","In below premium, the recently launched Miller High Life brand continues to deliver strong results, while complementing our Pilsner and Black Label brands and underpinning continued segment share growth. Finally, as we look to ongoing productivity improvements, the construction of our new highly efficient brewery in B.C. is on track for brewing in 2019 and planning for a new brewery in Qu\u00e9bec is advancing quickly.","Strong year-to-date performance from the International business gives us added confidence in generating $20 million to $25 million of underlying EBITDA this year. We expect the second half to build on the successes in Latin America, including in Mexico, Paraguay, and Honduras, along with further development of our Asia Pacific markets, such as South Korea.","Please note that Q2 represented the last quarter of lapping the loss of the Modelo contract in Japan last year. We'll continue to focus our efforts on succeeding in high-potential markets and brands that will play a pivotal role in reaching our long-term top and bottom line International growth targets. International will be a meaningful driver of underlying EBITDA performance for Molson Coors this year.","Across Molson Coors, our teams are focused on our first priority, which is to drive margin expansion, bottom line growth, and strong free cash flow enable deleverage; and our second priority, which remains to deliver an improved top line through our First Choice commercial excellence approach, which clearly provides the most sustainable source of profit growth over the medium to long term. Capital allocation within our business continues to be guided by the PACC approach, as we seek to deliver total shareholder returns.","Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks and slides will be on our website for your reference later this afternoon. Kevin Kim will be available via telephone or e-mail to assist with any additional questions.","So at this point, Anita, we'd like to open up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question today comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Mr. Spillane, please go ahead.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi and good morning, everyone.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Good morning, Bryan.","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Good morning.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Mark, I guess, at the Analyst Day in June, you made a comment about the consensus for the full year being, I guess, pessimistic, if I'm remembering the term correctly. And I'm just piecing together some of the things, incremental points that we've kind of heard today. It sounds like inflation is a little bit higher in the U.S., COGS inflation. Volumes were a little bit weaker than expected in the second quarter, but then there's going to be some inventory build. So just trying to \u2013 as we kind of tie together all of the sort of forward-looking comments that you made, does that affect at all kind of your view of where things stood versus the consensus back in June?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Bryan. So, obviously, I tried to offer a perspective when we met in June, and I think that held good at that point in time. And on the back of that, Q2 estimates came down by about $0.09 and full year estimates came up by about $0.07. So you've now seen our Q2 reported numbers and I think we've given a perspective as we come into the second half. Clearly, there'll be a benefit from the rev-rec reversal. There'll be a benefit from the STW builds. As you mentioned, inflation pressures are reasonably intense at the moment.","So I think we've still got a pretty balanced perspective on the full year. And if you remember, against the backdrop of what's been reasonably sluggish demand inflation and some of the mix challenges, we came into the year with a sense of a contingency in our plan and we're working hard on not only our base cost savings, but additional cost mitigation. I think we're demonstrating we've got flexibility with regard to our commercial spend and we're very focused on driving the right decisions to ensure that we deliver against the deleverage commitment. So probably a bit of a longer answer than you anticipated, but hopefully that gives you the color.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, I appreciate that. Thanks, Mark.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you very much. I'm wondering if you could maybe just kind of step back a little bit and talk about kind of a little bit of the recent history on the positioning for Coors Light and kind of the journey that you've taken on that, kind of what's worked, what hasn't worked, and what your analytics are telling you are the issues in terms of the brand equity, kind of what are the actual problems that your team is coming back and saying this is where we have particular problems in terms of whether it's the image of the brand or anything else in terms of the whole marketing landscape. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hi, Robert. Thanks for that. Let me give you a broad perspective and then, Gavin, do you want to pick up on some of the specifics in the U.S. But if you take a step back, obviously, we drive Coors Light as one of our global brands. The positioning of the brand is consistent on a multi-market basis and that's built very much around Cold Rocky Mountain refreshment, which comes to life as The World's Most Refreshing Beer. And that's working well for us in multiple markets, Robert, whether that's LatAm, Europe. Actually in Canada, as Fred made mention later, through the second quarter Coors Light was back in pretty solid single-digit growth in May, as an example. So we know when we get the execution right that the brand performs.","Our brand equity measures are actually moving in the right direction. We've got some challenges, I think, about making sure the total 360-degree program for Coors Light is as aggressive, assertive, and as well executed as it needs to be. So, Gavin, do you want to pick up on just some of the color around opportunity areas in the U.S. in particular?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, sure, Mark. I mean, look, Robert, it's no secret that the first six months have been a difficult six months for Coors Light. It has disproportionately, relative to some other brands, been impacted by the BP&S issues that we had in Golden. About a fifth of its decline in the second quarter would be associated with that. We launched new marketing executions in the middle of the second quarter and they're a step-up on last year, but they haven't driven a strong enough change in momentum. And so we'll be leaning in more heavily and even more differently on The World's Most Refreshing Beer messaging.","Our summer YETI program landed really well with our distributors and our retailers. And so we'll be building \u2013 it gives us a nice base for next summer. We're learning on our media mix what works and what doesn't, and so we'll be adjusting our media mix and leaning into what is working and what is not. And the final thing I would say is that our new CMO, who we're in the process of recruiting, their number one job will be Coors Light.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Gavin.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","And can you just follow-up on that, where you are on the CMO process, internal, external, and any thoughts around that and timing?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, Robert, we're looking at a wide range of candidates. We're looking for a fresh perspective on our marketing with, as I said, an urgent focus on turning around Coors Light and getting more growth in above premium. Our plans for the summer are locked, they're loaded, and we're executing them. And I don't need to sacrifice finding the right person for a short-term timeline. So we're moving at pace to recruit the marketing leader, but we're not ready to announce that yet.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Thank you very much.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Robert.","Operator","The next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hi, Judy.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, I guess, one is just a quick follow-up to the Coors Light question. Mark, I think you commented in your prepared comments about maybe increasing some promotional intensity as also part of the effort. So I'm just wondering if you can elaborate that a little bit more just in terms of promotion activity around Coors Light specifically?","And then my broader question is just really on the cost mitigation efforts that you're making. Obviously, it's been good to see managing that flexibility to meet the challenges of some of the headwinds this year. I'm just wondering if you can give some concrete examples of where you're lowering spending and how do you kind of assess the risk of not cutting too deep, particularly around the areas where that potentially impacts the market share performance. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, thanks, Judy. The comment I made in my prepared remarks are around promotional intensity relating specifically to Coors Light in Canada, and I think Fred has been very clear that we have the lion's share of our spend buying Coors Light into Q2 and Q3. That's kind of the critical couple of quarters and the brand is responding very, very positively. April was tough just because industry was really, really poor.","But as we've come through May and June, we're very, very encouraged by the trends we're seeing on Coors Light. And that promotional intensity really relates to the way that we bring the brand to life, specifically in The Beer Store in Ontario, where we've reinstituted in case promotional mechanics, which we'd walked away from and the rest of the market hadn't. So it's really about how we choose to invest our commercial dollars, Judy. Don't read that as any sense but, hey, we want to get really aggressive on price. We are not doing that. We're making sure we offer great value to our consumers and we'll do that in a way that's appropriate market-by-market. Tracey, do you want to pick up on costs?","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. So hi, Judy. So, as we look at the inflationary environment, which is well documented and we've spoken about this morning, it is very important for us to look at cost mitigation if it's in addition to the cost savings that we're going to deliver this year. So I'll give you an example around G&A spend. So where we have head count vacancies, for example, we may choose not to fill them this year, and then fill those next year. So that would be an example of the types of mitigation that we're looking at.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","I think, Judy, you also want to talk just about making sure that we've got the balance right in terms of supporting our portfolio. And one of the things that we benefit from is the fact that our ROMI program allows us to, I think, measure in a pretty sophisticated way where we get the biggest bang for our buck. And interestingly, if you look at Coors Light and Miller Lite in the U.S., our spend is relatively similar, pretty much identical. Miller Lite is performing better. So it really is about kind of the quality of our content and the quality of our execution, and that's really what we're focused on.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Judy.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much. Mark, as it relates to the U.S., in June you'd called out a soft April, but seemed more upbeat on May trends. And based on the results today, I'm assuming that June slowed again, which would align with what we see in the market data. But I'd just love your perspective on what you've seen across the quarter and whether it impacts your confidence in the back half at all. It sounds like you still expect a meaningful ramp in shipment volumes, but I'm not clear if that's just a product of shipment comps and timing or whether you see true cause for industry trends or market share improving as well.","And maybe on a related point, Gavin, with STWs leading STRs in the quarter, can you just update us on where you see channel inventories exiting the quarter and whether that impacts anything you've said previously about that first quarter shortfall, that $30 million or so in gross profit, being made up in the back half? Or do we see some of that being made up in the quarter? Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Steve. Gavin, I'll attempt to pick up the first question and if you can pick up the second. I think it's fair to say, Steve, on the U.S. industry, I mean, we're seeing a choppiness from an industry demand perspective. We kind of get a good month and then a weaker month certainly as we've come through the second quarter and come into July.","We're very encouraged by the fact our July volume performance in the U.S. is about 200 basis points better than what we've seen on a year-to-date basis. So we alluded to the fact that we believed as we came into the second half and we got some of the Golden issues behind us, we'd be much more back in our stride, and that's certainly playing out in the volume numbers and improvement in the share trend that we've seen, which has been meaningful for our business as we've come through July.","So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color. Industry is still tracking at the half year down about 2.3%. And we've talked publicly in the past that we expect the U.S. beer industry on a medium to long-term basis probably to be down somewhere between 0.5% and 1%. We talked to that when we were together in New York. Gavin, do you want to pick up the specifics of STWs versus STRs?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, sure, Mark. I mean, also add just a touch more color to the second quarter, Steve. Our Golden rollout did hurt us in the second quarter, probably about 100 basis points from a volume percentage point of view. And we also agree with the industry pundits that July 4 falling on a Wednesday hurt volume sales in June. And, of course, we had the holiday timing and difficult April. And, as Mark says, our trends have improved quite nicely in the last four-week read.","From a shipments point of view, we're still expecting to build inventory with our distributors as we head into the next go-lives. We've had suggested orders for July and the distributors have actually met that and slightly exceeded it. So I think our comments around inventory build that we made on the first quarter call still hold true for the second half, and you will see STWs outpace STRs meaningfully in the second half as we build those inventories heading into the full year and the $30 million number still holds true.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, that's great. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","The next question is from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Gerald Pascarelli - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Gerald Pascarelli on for Vivien. Thanks very much for taking the questions. So on cannabis, has your team performed their due diligence to identify potential partners? What were the key criteria that you were looking for? And within that due diligence, what insights have you gleaned as it relates to the interaction between alcohol and cannabis as substitute social lubricants? Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","I was going to say thanks for your question, Vivien, but you caught me on the back foot there. So two questions there. I mean, clearly, as we went through this process, we did a very thorough due diligence process. Clearly, we're looking for an organization that was reflective of our values. We're looking for an organization that was science-based. We're looking for an organization that had guarantee in continuity of supplies. And we're looking for an organization that already had a track record and shared the ambition that we have to create alcohol-free cannabis-infused beverages that are delivered in a responsible way.","So, I mean, that was a framework we used. Clearly, there was a little bit more detailed buying that from a financial due diligence perspective, but that was kind of the broad framework. And we're delighted with the partnership we've announced today. We think we've got a very strong partner and we're setting a business up to really drive a very clear and very responsible agenda in Canada. Fred, do you want to talk a little bit about what we're seeing from an interaction between cannabis and other alcoholic beverages?","Frederic Landtmeters - Molson Coors Canada, Inc.","Sure, Mark. So basically it's been very clear since we knew that legalization of cannabis was going to be confirmed that the consumer acceptance of cannabis in Canada is increasing. And we believe that that's only going to continue to happen. So in parallel with that, we expect consumer needs and preferences to evolve, and it's really in that context that we have made the decision to set up the JV with HEXO.","So the interaction, and in terms of impact of cannabis on beer, I've mentioned it before and I still have the same perspective that it's really difficult to evaluate that as long as legalization doesn't really happen, and that's foreseen to be in October of this year. So I think it's going to be a little bit of wait-and-see in terms of the real impact. But clearly, in terms of consumer needs and preferences, based on the acceptance and the legalization, we expect that to increase going forward.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","And, Gerald, the other thing I would add is, as we went through this process, the decision we had to make was do we want to be a spectator or a participant. We concluded we wanted to be a participant in this new segment and we concluded we wanted to be an active participant with a trusted partner, and that's what we've announced today. I think it's clear that the opportunity is still unproven, because we're actually not through legalization. But we believe, based on all the work we've done, that it's potentially have got very significant potential and that needs to be proven out over the medium to long term. So this is a first step for us. I think it's a very appropriate structure that we've set up and we're very excited about what the next handful of years could bring.","Gerald Pascarelli - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Good morning.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Good morning.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So we're a couple of years past the original statement that you were hoping to return to volume growth in the U.S. in 2019. Obviously, expectations have moderated a lot since then, but we're pretty far away from that goal, given the top line performance we saw in Q1. And given these volume declines are accelerating, I'm just hoping to get sort of a high-level perspective and review on what hasn't played out since then as you expected. Maybe some of the challenges that have cropped up and, more importantly, taking a forward look with the dissatisfaction with your U.S. market share results you mentioned. What's different about the strategy today to drive that forward U.S. volume growth versus if you were to go back a year or two ago? Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Again, let me give you a couple of high-level comments, and then Gavin can talk to some of the detail. I think both Gavin and I have been pretty consistent as we've come through 2018 and the back end of 2017. Our ambition to get to flat and growth is, obviously, going to be tempered by the overall industry performance we've seen, which clearly has been more negative than we'd anticipated.","Getting our business stabilized and back into growth remains a strategic imperative. And I think we've demonstrated with the addition of brands like Sol and like Arnold Palmer, we are resolute on broadening and deepening the potential and the capability of our portfolio, and we continue to work on other additions to our portfolio. So the strategic intent hasn't changed, but clearly has been more challenging.","And in simple terms, there are two pieces that have not gone according to plan. One is the Coors Light performance, and the second is our performance in FMBs. All other parts of our portfolio are pretty much in line with what we'd anticipated. So, that tries to simplify it as best I can. But, Gavin, do you want to pick up and offer any other color?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. Mark, I mean, you covered it fairly comprehensively. I mean, all I can add to what you said was, I mean, obviously, given the first six months, we're not going to get to flat in 2018 and you've covered the reasons why. It doesn't change the strategic importance of it, but we're certainly not going to get to flat and growth by any cost. I think we were pretty clear on that as well. We've had some self-inflicted challenges around our Golden rollout and our intent just to make sure that those don't happen with our future rollouts.","If you take a step back and look at the three segments, we're pleased with our performance. In the economy portfolio, we've met our objective of halving our decline rate and holding share. We have grown the above premium overall, but we're not growing as quickly as we want to do, not by any means. And we do think we've got some real winners in above premium, which we'll be leaning into, like Sol and Arnold Palmer Spiked and Peroni and our craft companies.","Blue Moon has returned to growth. Blue Moon was the biggest impact after Coors Banquet of our Golden go-live, and so that brand family has returned to growth in the last four weeks. A strong brand, very pleased with that. And as Mark says, Coors Light remains our biggest challenge in the Premium Light segment. Miller Lite continues to gain meaningful share of Premium Light, and job number one for us is to return Coors Light to the position it was in before.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And the Coors Light improvement, is that mainly through the marketing message, as you touched on earlier? Are there other areas you think that can drive improvement in that brand that you're focused on?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, sure. This is not just about marketing. There's many elements of Coors Light which we're working on and which we need to improve focus and trajectory. So, no, this is not just about a marketing campaign at all.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hi, Amit.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hey, Amit. How are you?","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Mark, good, thanks. Couple of questions, Mark. First, if you can provide us an update on the Pabst lawsuit, where are we, what's the expected timeline and what's the preferable solution from your perspective from that lawsuit.","And then second, for Tracey. Tracey, your comments on capital allocation are very clear on three objectives. Is that how you see \u2013 is that the right order of investment or capital allocation as you think about the three between dividend, investment, and share buyback?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. On the first one, the Pabst lawsuit goes to trial in November. The preferred outcome is we win the lawsuit. That's as simple as I can make it. We've been very clear in our intentions, we've been very clear on how we expect this to play out, and we'll know in November whether we've been successful or not. So that's probably all I can say at this stage. There's no new news beyond that. Tracey, do you want to pick up on capital allocation?","Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yes. Hi, Amit. So on the capital allocation, we have spoken about the three buckets of allocation, and it's not in any particular order. But our number one priority is to secure our investment-grade rating, so that's really the strengthening of the balance sheet in the sort of short term. And then after that, we look at all of our capital allocations and any investment we make we look through our PACC model. So just making sure that we get the highest return to drive the long-term shareholder value, so we will assess each of the investments as and when they come up, and then decide which is the best one for that long-term shareholder return.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Amit.","Operator","Next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you and good morning. So going back to the discretionary marketing spending from the MG&A decline of 5% in the U.S. So how much was it related to marketing vis-\u00e0-vis the underlying items as part of the restructuring program that you have? That's my first question.","And related to that, what gives you comfort \u2013 and I know Gavin has spoke to that and you also, Mark, on reverting Coors Light share losses now that your marketing spend is lower, or should we expect market share recovery only in 2019 when you cycle the tough comps for cost and therefore, you can go back to normalized levels of marketing? Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Andrea, on our MG&A, we don't split that out by separate line item. So it's bundled together and we're not going to break that out. On the second point, the challenge we're dealing with on Coors Light is not unique in our business. We've dealt with this challenge in many of other markets with our large core brands and we've got a track record of both stabilizing and turning around our brands. And actually in the U.S. if you look at the success on Miller Lite, so our spend levels on Coors Light are very equivalent to our spend levels in Miller Lite.","So for me, this is less of a spend issue and much more of quality of content and focus of execution issue, and that's what the teams are resolved to deal with as we go through the second half. I'm not going to predict where our share number will be in the second half, but as Gavin and I have spoken to getting our broader business stabilized and back into growth remains a strategic imperative in the U.S.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Andrea.","Operator","The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hi, Lauren.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. I was hoping we could talk a little bit about pricing. I was pretty surprised just the call out about global pricing up so strongly, U.S. pricing, and evenly it looks even a bit stronger than what we see in the P&L, because the mention of negative mix in a couple spots. So could you talk a little bit about early thoughts on industry pricing evolving from here, particularly in the context of rising input costs, if you've sort of made your move? Or is something that might come in the second half of the year still potentially incremental to what we're seeing in the P&L already?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","So I'm assuming, Lauren, is your question related to the U.S.?","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","U.S. and global. I mean, I care most about the U.S., obviously, just given the size, but there was commentary on positive pricing everywhere.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, I mean, across our business, I think we have built our sophistication around our pricing and revenue management approach, and we're very clear on the frameworks and our expectations that we have across our markets. But the specific detail is delegated to each of the business unit CEOs to make sure they're making the right calls on a market-by-market basis. But, clearly, as I think we've talked about consistently, premiumization of our portfolios are driving our mix positively and, at the same time, making sure the overall NSR per hectoliter continues to move up as one of the KPIs that we set for our self in our business. So that's kind of a broad perspective. Gavin, do you want to talk in a bit more detail about the U.S. pricing environment and our intentions going forward? Not that you offer a lot of detail, I'm sure.","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah. No, we'll be offering a lot of details on a go-forward basis Lauren (00:54:28).","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","(00:54:27).","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","But just one call out. I've noticed a number of folk are calling out 0.9% increase in our pricing. Actually, that is 1.6% when you adjust on a comparable basis for the revenue recognition guidance. We had negative mix in the quarter of about 80 basis points, so our frontline up about 2.4% across all the pricing components. Most of that mix negativity was package mix. And, obviously, that's driven by the success of our Keystone Light 15 packs and Keystone Ice.","And from a cost input pressure point of view, I mean, we've made no secret about the fact that aluminum tariffs and freight and the unjustified increase in the Midwest Premium are having a negative impact on our cost structure, and they may factor into future pricing decisions. That said, as Mark says, we price our brands as we always have priced them. It's done at the local level. It's done at market by market and brand by brand, and it takes into account the competitive environment in which we're operating.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And would you say that you don't think your share performance is at all impacted by pricing? It looks like it's trending a bit above what you're seeing from some of your competition at this point.","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","No, I don't think our share performance has been impacted by pricing. I think our share loss is driven by the challenging supply chain environment that we've had in the first six months, which we are, obviously, through that now. Our competitors' innovations have driven faster results than our innovations have and we'll, obviously, be driving hard against that. We're also cycling some really good share performance from last year. We're cycling the Keystone 15-pack from last year. And whilst Keystone Light is still growing very nicely, our biggest competitor is, obviously, benefiting from the launch of the Natty Light 15-pack. Our share trends are stabilized and actually slightly improved over the last two reads.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, that's great. Thanks so much.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Lauren, the only other thing I would add is just a reminder of how our incentive program is set up. So our annual incentive program has got four key components, one of which is our NSR per hectoliter. So it has been and remains a priority in our business to improve our NSR through both pure price and mix.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks so much.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Lauren.","Operator","The next question comes from Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Please go ahead.","Pablo Zuanic - SIG","Good morning, everyone. Just two questions. First on the pricing question that you just had, maybe asking a different way. I think in the Coca-Cola conference call, they talked about taking pricing out of cycle. In the beer industry, normally we see price increases in the late fall. So just if you can talk about that, are we seeing price increases earlier than normal, or should we expect to see price increases later in the fall? Just in general. I know you're not going to forward comment on price. But just in general, if you can add some color there, because, again, your peers in other industry soft drinks are talking about out-of-cycle pricing.","And the second question, just in terms of relationship with STWs and STRs. I mean, given the comps, it seems that pretty much through 2Q 2019 your STWs should be running ahead of STRs, right? Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Gavin, do you want to pick up both of those? They're very U.S.-specific.","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, sure. No, there haven't been out-of-cycle price increases, Pablo. I think the comment you might be referencing was some of the soft drink guys have taken out-of-cycle pricings. We have not done that. And then from an STW point of view, certainly in Q3 and Q4 I would be expecting our STWs to run ahead of STRs. I mean, I'm not ready to give you any input or feedback for Q1 or Q2 of next year at this point.","Pablo Zuanic - SIG","That's fine. Thanks. And, Mark, if I can just a follow-up, more general question on, I know Sol is still very small and I can't believe I'm asking a question about Sol. But I'm surprised about how visible the product has become on the shelves, the advertising. It seems that you're executing very well, but a lot of the distributors that you go through are also Constellation Brands distributors, Corona, Modelo Especial, and also Heineken distributors, right, Dos Equis, Tecate. So just enlighten us a little bit on that, because I was very skeptical about the launch, given the overlap with more established competitors, using the same distributors, but here you are apparently making some headway there.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Pablo. Yeah, I mean, I'm pleased that you've recognized that. I think Gavin and the sales team led by Kevin are doing a first-class job. The one thing to remember is that much of the volume is driven through the major customers, grocery customers and national chain customers. And accountability for negotiating and securing those placement sits with our team and our distributor's job is to fulfill against those placements. So, obviously, our distributors negotiate for independent on and independent off. So Kevin Doyle and his chain team have done a great job of securing listings, and that's what you're seeing turn up in the marketplace.","So we've had generally good support across our distributor base. As you say, clearly some distributors are a little bit more tentative, but I think the proof will be in the pudding, and we like and our distributors and our customers like brands that succeed and has a gravitational pull. And our job is to demonstrate that Sol is a brand that is off to a great start, can maintain that momentum, and has more to offer. And I think as we continue to do that, you'll see more people get behind the brand. Gavin, I probably went into a lot more detail there than I should have done, but anything to add to that?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, sure. And, Mark, just a few things. I mean, Sol growing in triple digits, we're very pleased with that. Lots of excitement from our distributors. And that triple-digit increase in volume is in the context of a substantial increase in price. I mean, our dollars are running \u2013 and retail dollars are running substantially higher than that. We're well over 200%. So when you think about that and the new premium bottle, the new 24-ounce can, the new vibrant and fresh look for the brand, we're very excited about it and so are our distributors, and we're seeing that.","Pablo Zuanic - SIG","Helpful. And, Mark, if I can ask one last one if you're there. This idea of cannabis in beer in Canada I understand, but in the U.S., is that a possibility in those markets where cannabis are legal?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","It's a good question, Pablo, and our focus is absolutely on Canada at this point in time. It's going to be federally legal and approved there, and in the U.S. that's not the case. So we'll keep a watch in brief on the U.S., but as a federally regulated company then we'll tread very, very carefully. And I think the great thing about what we're doing in Canada gives us a real opportunity to incubate and test. As I mentioned, this whole segment and the opportunity is speculated, but unproven at this point in time. We believe potentially it's got really significant potential and we're going to learn a lot. And if other markets start to open up in due course and this becomes federally legal, then we'll be in a good place at that point in time. But Canada is a focus at this stage, Pablo.","Pablo Zuanic - SIG","Got it. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Tristan van Strien with Redburn. Please go ahead.","Tristan van Strien - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Good morning. Sorry, a bit more about pricing, my apologies for that. But just on the longer timeframe, when MillerCoors was created a decade ago, there was a lot of effort being put into narrow the gap between pricing Premium Lights and below premium, and a lot of work was put into that. But now it appears to have all reversed more than that, in the case of Keystone Light today is actually cheaper than it was a decade ago. So it's, obviously, worked for Keystone light, like there is some great growth. So how should we think about this going forward? Do you expect this gap to further widen, especially now with Natty Light also discounting in the 15-pack? And maybe related to that, a decade ago Coors Light was sitting at a 30% premium to Keystone Light, today carries close to a 45% premium. What gives you the confidence that the brand can carry such a big premium compared to the below premium brands?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Thanks, Tristan. One of the things that we do do is very carefully track substitution and cannibalization. And if behind your point is there any concern that Keystone Light is having an impact on Coors Light, there is no data to support that. But, Gavin, do you want to just talk more generally about the inter-relationship between below premium and premium pricing?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, I mean, thanks, Mark. Tristan, we spend a lot of time looking at the gaps between our various brands, between the economy brands and the Premium Light brands. And I think I said on the call last year maybe that in some markets we've probably gone a little too far in economy and dialed it back a little bit. But generally we're very careful about the gaps that exist between our economy and our Premium Lights, and also our above premium brands and we spend a lot of time looking at what our competitors are doing.","Yeah, I mean, it's true that in some markets the price of beer is very similar to what it was many years ago, but I could point to just as many markets where that is not true. And, I think, we've also been consistent in the fact that we have taken price fairly consistently on an overall basis over the years. I wouldn't necessarily agree with all the premises of what you're saying.","Tristan van Strien - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Okay. Maybe just also related to that and that's just more on your CMO search. You guys have always had very much of a pure marketing-oriented CMOs rather than commercial directors or chief commercial officers as you would call them. But it looks like you said earlier Coors Light is not just a marketing issue; it's much broader. And, I guess, I put pricing in there potentially as well. So when you're looking for this new person, are you looking for somebody who's more commercially-oriented, or is it more a pure marketer you're looking for?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Let me make a general comment, Tristan, which is I expect all of my marketers to be commercially-oriented. But, Gav, do you want to talk about the specifics?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, I mean, I think you answered the question perfectly, Mark. We're not just looking for someone who's a pure brand architect brand architect, but I do want someone who's got deep brand experience. And beyond that, looking for a broader commercially-oriented person. My comments around marketing, Tristan, was about this is not just a marketing campaign, right? It's about all elements, as Mark said earlier on, around 360 through-the-line approach. And so, how you come to market, in which pack sizes, what your visual identity is, how you bring The World's Most Refreshing Beer to life in the market, it's all of these elements.","Tristan van Strien - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","And just one...","Tristan van Strien - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Yeah.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Tristan, one last point is that if you look at the CMOs across our business, every one of our CMOs has got a balance and a blend of both sales and marketing experience. So that's a model that certainly has worked for us and continues to work for us in our other business units.","Operator","The last question today comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hey, everyone. Just a quick one. I think when we were in New York, you were talking about marketing spend or marketing support has some level of flexibility relative to volume and sales. And, clearly, we're \u2013 I guess, this is more of a U.S. question, but we're seeing some level of softness or weakness. I mean, can you just talk about how you look at marketing spend relative to a spirits industry, where the largest player is talking about stepping up meaningfully and we've generally seen increases, just the interaction between beer and spirits and thinking about that on your spending in the marketplace? Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, Brett, it's a good question. I think it varies on a kind of geography-by-geography basis. I mean, we try and be as sophisticated as we can when we look at how much we're investing behind our brands and look broadly competitively principally against our beer competitors, but we do also reference what's happening in other segments as well. But the principal focus is really against our beer competitors. I think once you get into spirits and you look at some of the premium pricing and just some of the kind of niche segments, it's very difficult to draw comparison.","So we continued to use our ROMI model. We continue to test the effectiveness of our spend in marketplace. And if you look at our International and our Europe business, for example, through the second quarter and first half, our MG&A spend is down and our performance is strong and improving. So I think we're pretty sophisticated in terms of how we look at the absolute spend requirements and the competitiveness of the market, and clearly that's always going to be set in the context of how is our broader business performing, what's inflationary pressures, what's happening with the overall industry demand. So it's a pretty complex three-dimensional model and it's as much science as we can and a little bit of art. I don't know if that helps, Brett.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","No, that's great. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mark Hunter for any closing remarks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Thanks, Anita.

Swinburn","Thank you, Chrissy. Hello, and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call, and thank you for joining us today. With me on the call this morning are Gavin Hattersley, Molson Coors' CFO; Dave Perkins, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors Central Europe; Stewart Glendinning, CEO of Molson Coors U.K.; Kandy Anand, CEO of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors' Chief Legal and People Officer; Zahir Ibrahim, Molson Coors' Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors' VP of Investor Relations.","On the earnings call today, Gavin and I will take you through highlights of our third quarter results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with our outlook for the fourth quarter.","The third quarter was our first full reporting period following our Central European acquisition. The addition of this business provided more than $60 million of pretax earnings accretion on an underlying basis, net of related interest expense. Strong results in the U.S. also contributed to our bottom line growth. As a result, underlying after-tax income increased more than 17% to $249 million, and underlying EPS grew more than 20% to $1.37 per share. Gross margin and underlying operating margin, including our share of MillerCoors, both increased significantly with the addition of the Central Europe business this year.","Regionally, the U.S. had another good earnings quarter, up 16%, while the U.K., Canada and our International business reported lower earnings, with the Canada beer market being particularly weak in the third quarter. In local currency, Central Europe underlying earnings increased nearly 16% on a pro forma basis. Negative currency movements, however, meant Central Europe pro forma earnings decreased 2.2% in the third quarter. Central Europe pro forma volume declined 1.5% due to a decrease in consumer demand, particularly in September, but we maintained solid market share in the region. Gavin will provide additional financial highlights in a minute.","With respect to our brands, third quarter Coors Light brand sales to retail grew market share in the U.S., the U.K. and in Canada. In Central Europe, we grew share in the majority of our markets, and Staropramen brand grew volume at a low double-digit rate in the region. Our premium craft brands in the U.S. and Canada substantially outperformed the industry to grow market share in the quarter. Miller Lite declined mid-single digits but reduced its trend graph to the overall market versus the first half of the year. The Carling brand grew share in its biggest channel, the on-premise, in a very weak U.K. economy, whilst Coors Light is growing at a strong double-digit rate and is now our second biggest brand in the U.K.","Nonetheless, we saw a decline in consumer demand across our businesses in the third quarter, and we expect the fourth quarter to be the most challenging of this year, with difficult profit comparisons in Canada and the U.K. and higher costs in the U.S. and Central Europe.","In this challenging macroeconomic climate, we have consistently said that in addition to growing our brands, we would aggressively drive costs out of our business. In the third quarter, our Resources for Growth program delivered $22 million in saving, bringing total program savings to $172 million since 2010. In Canada and the U.K., these cost savings offset cost of goods inflation. Our share of MillerCoors results added another $12 million of cost saving.","Consistent with this strategy, in the third quarter, we began a number of new initiatives to standardize and further streamline our company over the next 2 years. As a first step, at the end of this year, we will combine our U.K. and Ireland business with our new Central Europe organization to create a single European business called Molson Coors Europe.  This move will allow us to use our go-to-market resources more effectively in the region and promote better sharing of commercial best practices and marketing expertise. With the larger European footprint, we'll be able to negotiate better terms with suppliers, improve processes and integrate systems to increase efficiencies. We will continue to manage the export and license business in Europe, including Staropramen export through Molson Coors International.","Along with this restructuring, we are making a few leadership changes. First, I've named Mark Hunter as CEO of our combined Europe business effective January 1. Since taking on the leadership of Molson Coors Central Europe earlier this year, Mark has gained deep insight into the business and earned the trust and confidence of the new team. And it's a major advantage for us that Mark brings so much experience with these markets to his new expanded role.","Next, Dave Perkins plans to retire at the end of January. Dave has spent more than 30 years in the beer business and has led operations around the globe, from Asia to Europe to Mexico and beyond. It is fitting that he retires from the top job in Canada after spending so many years successfully building the Molson brands.","Finally, I have appointed Stewart Glendinning to replace David as CEO in Canada upon Dave's retirement. Stewart's experience includes a broad range of executive leadership positions, including Global Chief Financial Officer and CEO U.K. and Ireland. And as such, he is perfectly qualified to lead the Canada business.","With that as an overview, I'll turn it over to Gavin to give third quarter financial highlights and a perspective on the fourth quarter. Gavin?","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks, Peter, and hello, everybody. In third quarter financial highlights, Molson Coors third quarter underlying earnings increased 17.2% to $248 million -- $248.9 million, while underlying earnings per share increased 20.2% to $1.37 per share. The acquisition of Central Europe drove the increase in underlying EPS, along with the performance of MillerCoors and lower shares outstanding, following our repurchases in the second half of last year. Earnings accretion from Central Europe is made up of $82.6 million of underlying pretax income in the quarter, including the export business that is now part of our International group and partially offset by $22.4 million of acquisition-related interest expense in Corporate.","Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors increased nearly 31% due to the addition of Central Europe results. On a pro forma basis, including Central Europe in 2011, worldwide volume decreased 3% for the quarter, driven by lower volume in the U.K., the United States, Canada and Central Europe and partially offset by growth in International.","Regionally, MillerCoors contributed a 16% increase in underlying profit, driven by continued strong pricing, favorable brand mix and cost reductions. In Canada, positive pricing and cost reductions were more than offset by the negative impact of lower volume and mix shift towards higher-cost products and packages, increased pension costs and foreign currency movements. The U.K. had a very challenging quarter due to lower volumes, higher input inflation, cycling the prior year reduction in employee incentive expenses, partially offset by cost reductions.","Now a note about how we are presenting our results for our new Central Europe business and MillerCoors International. In order to provide the most useful information, we will discuss Central Europe results this year in comparison to pro forma results for the comparable prior year period. As Peter mentioned, beginning this quarter, our International group is managing the export and license business for our Central Europe brands. The discussion of our consolidated financials and our Canada, U.K. and Corporate results will be on the same basis as before the Central Europe acquisition.","As we have in previous quarters, I will provide an overview of our results with MillerCoors presented as it were proportionately consolidated. This is a non-GAAP approach, but we believe it provides a useful view of some key performance metrics for our business. On this basis, total company net sales increased 14.2% in the third quarter, driven by the addition of the Central Europe business, along with growth in the U.S. and International. Net sales per hectoliter decreased 11.8% in the quarter due to the addition of Central Europe sales with a lower net sales per hectoliter, which more than offset solid pricing in the U.S., Central Europe and Canada. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 13.2% due to the addition of Central Europe, which has a lower cost structure than our other segments. Total company gross margin was 41.4%, 100 basis points higher than a year ago, primarily due to the strong economies of scale and margin structure in Central Europe, coupled with the margin expansion of 140 basis points in the U.S. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 12% due to the addition of Central Europe results. Underlying operating margin was 17.3%, up 150 basis points from a year ago due to the addition of Central Europe operating income this year and margin growth in the U.S.","Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter, including for Central Europe, on a comparable pro forma basis.","It is important to note that our third quarter underlying results exclude some special and other noncore gains, losses and expenses that net to a $62.4 million pretax charge. These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results primarily relate to Central Europe acquisition, financing and integration and the impairment of our China joint venture, and are described in detail in this morning's earnings release.","Underlying free cash flow for the first 3 quarters of this year totaled $742 million, nearly reaching our goal of $750 million, plus or minus 10%, for 2012. This $278 million increase over last year was primarily driven by an increase in operating cash flow due to the addition of Central Europe and year-over-year changes in the timing of working capital. Our year-to-date cash generation was made up of the following: $840 million of operating cash flow, which includes $437 million from MillerCoors, plus $148 million of net addbacks for Central Europe acquisition-related costs, along with purchases and sales of businesses and other assets. Investing cash outflows were $143 million of capital spending and $103 million of cash invested in MillerCoors. Although we nearly achieved our full year free cash flow goal in the third quarter, it is important to remember that timing of working capital can have a large effect on quarterly cash generation. And our goal of $750 million, plus or minus 10%, is unchanged.","Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $4.7 billion, $200 million lower than the beginning of the quarter. And cash and cash equivalents totaled $586 million, resulting in net debt of $4.1 billion, approximately $300 million lower than 3 months earlier.","Looking forward, we are updating our guidance in a few areas. We expect our 2012 MG&A expense in Corporate to be approximately $135 million, with about $40 million of this representing acquisition-related fees and expenses that we exclude from our underlying results. After lowering our 2012 effective tax rate guidance in September to a range of 15% to 19%, we are now also lowering our long-term tax rate guidance to a range of 20% to 24%. This 2-percentage-point reduction in the range is principally due to the Central Europe acquisition.","As far as our cost outlook is concerned, in Canada for 2012, we continue to expect our all-in cost of goods sold to increase at a high single-digit rate per hectoliter in local currency due to higher pension costs, mix shifts towards higher-cost brands and packages and the absence of the NAB contract volume in the first half of last year. In the United States, we continue to expect MillerCoors cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a low single-digit rate for the full year 2012. In Central Europe, we now anticipate a mid-single-digit increase in pro forma cost of goods sold per hectoliter this year in local currency, a change driven by increases in both brewing and packaging material costs. In the U.K., we still expect our full year cost of goods sold per hectoliter to grow at a high single-digit rate in local currency, primarily due to input inflation, sales mix, pension costs and expenses related to the U.K. brewery improvement program. Our International business anticipate cost of goods sold per hectoliter to decrease at a low single-digit rate for the full year due to the addition of the Central Europe export business, along with geographic mix changes.","In other outlook, at current rates, we do not expect foreign exchange to have a significant impact on consolidated fourth quarter financial results. Nonetheless, as Peter mentioned, we expect the fourth quarter to be the most challenging overall this year, with difficult profit and volume comparisons in Canada and the U.K., along with increased input costs in Central Europe and significantly higher marketing and business transformation costs in the United States.","At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for regional outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Peter?","Peter S. Swinburn","Thanks, Gavin. In Canada, we launched Rickard's Cardigan and Oakhouse, our first seasonal brands in the Rickard's family. We continue to realize strong pricing gains but remain focused on managing the right balance of price and volume. Our recent fourth quarter volume trends reflect continued industry weakness, as well as the impact of the National Hockey League lockout, which has limited our opportunity to activate Molson Canadian and Coors Light at retail.","Also, in the fourth quarter, we are cycling the 53rd week in our fiscal 2011, which last year provided approximately $12 million of additional pretax income in Canada. We are also cycling approximately $10 million of adjustments last year that we do not expect to repeat this year. And finally, we anticipate about $5 million of additional pension and other retirement expenses in the fourth quarter, which is consistent with each of the first 3 quarters this year.","In the U.S., we expect fourth quarter results to be affected significantly by incremental spending for marketing and business transformation, as well as the impact of a planned reduction in distributor inventories by year end. Specifically, we expect to see high single-digit increase in MillerCoors' marketing, general and administrative costs, driven by brand investments in the range of $20 million higher than last year, along with a substantial increase in business transformation spending, which is designed to transform the way the U.S. team works to improving core capabilities, simplifying business processes and building information systems. On a year-to-date basis, U.S. sales to wholesalers have significantly outpaced sales to retailers, resulting in higher distributor inventory levels at the end of September versus prior year. However, given MillerCoors' plan to shift to consumption for the full year, we expect distributor inventory levels to revert to 2011 levels by year's end.","In Central Europe, our third quarter results were impacted by weak economic conditions. However, we grew share in the majority of our markets in the region. Our innovations continued to take share and support margin growth. We plan to accelerate further introductions to additional countries in the near term. Because the business put forward its investments behind innovations and marketing efforts ahead of the peak season this year, our results in the third quarter benefited from lower marketing and innovation spending versus a year ago. We expect this benefit to continue in the fourth quarter. Additionally, following expansion last year, Staropramen is growing strongly across all of the Central Europe markets in which we operate.","In the U.K., we are capitalizing on the success of Carling Zest citrus by introducing a winter version with a hint of spiced orange. Also, our brewery network investment continues, with building work started in preparation for the arrival of a new state-of-the-art bottling line in Burton in the first quarter of 2013. In the fourth quarter, we face particularly challenging STR and underlying profit comparisons, which increased 16% and 29%, respectively, in the U.K. a year ago.","Our International business continues to drive top line growth through our key global brands. And the addition to Staropramen to our portfolio enhances our growth opportunities. We now expect the 2012 investment in our International business to be moderately lower than last year on an underlying basis, including the benefit of 6 months of Central Europe export earnings.","Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the fourth quarter. In Canada, our sales-to-retail in the first 4 weeks of the quarter declined at a high single-digit rate versus 2011, primarily related to continued industry declines, along with the NHL lockout. In the U.S., for the 4 weeks ended October 27, STRs were flat versus a year ago. In Central Europe, our sales volume decreased at a low single-digit rate in the first month of the quarter. In the first 4 weeks of the quarter, our U.K. STRs decreased at a low double-digit rate, driven by challenging comparisons in the off-premise channel. And in the first 4 weeks, our International STRs decreased at a double-digit rate, excluding the addition of Central Europe export, driven by the year-on-year timing differences and the deconsolidation of the China joint venture. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead.","To summarize our discussion today, in the first full quarter of owning our Central Europe business, the addition of these results, net of financing costs, drove strong earnings growth. We continue to expect that the acquisition will strengthen our company, enhance our growth profile and increase shareholder value. In the third quarter, we grew total company underlying free cash flow, operating profit, after-tax income and earnings per share, all at double-digit rates. Looking forward, we anticipate significant volume and earnings headwinds in the fourth quarter. Recognizing these challenges in our businesses, we began a number of new initiatives in the third quarter to standardize and further streamline our company over the next 2 years. Combining the U.K. and Ireland business with our new Central Europe organization to create a single Molson Coors Europe business is the start of that process. All of these steps are designed to improve efficiency and effectiveness across our company and drive profit cash and value for our shareholders.","Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 2 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. That call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.","So at this point, Chrissy, we would like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The first question is just really trying to understand better what's going on in Canada, both from an industry perspective and from your market share perspective, so just some color around the industry-wide softness that you're seeing. And then your volume softness, how much is that industry-wide-driven as opposed to maybe competitive environment getting worse, especially for some of the value brands?","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes, okay, Judy, thanks. I'll pass that on to Dave. There are a number of moving parts, and so I think it's better if Dave gives you the detail on that. Dave?","David Perkins","... and in Molson volume for quarter 3. Nonetheless, we did see underlying softness in the industry. Hand in hand with that, we saw a pretty competitive pricing environment, so more beer being sold on promotion across the country. And the other thing that we saw that was very significant for us was a strong shift to cans that has been unfolding through the year. And just to give you a sense of the significance, in a market like Qu\u00e9bec, where it was most pronounced, we saw cans increase about 30%, so very significant shift. Within that context, we maintained positive pricing. I think you've seen in our NSR per hec numbers that we've led the industry there. So I'm pleased on the pricing front. We lost about 1 share point. We estimate 1\/2 of that share loss is related to can shortages that we ran through the quarter. And so we had difficulty meeting that unexpectedly large shift to cans. We're at very high capacity utilization, our first season of ramping up our major new can line in Montreal. And so we did run some reasonably extensive shortages of product. So that would account for about 1\/2 the share loss, as I said. The remainder of the share loss is really what I've talked about in prior quarters, you've seen it in recent quarters, and it's the segment shifting that we continue to experience. So we're very well developed in the mainstream. We are less well developed in above-premium, but we're growing our share there, and that's really a focus for us. And then we're quite underdeveloped in value where we see growth. And through Keystone and the use of regional brands, we continue to attempt to strengthen our position there. And so the segment shifting is really the key factor in the underlying longer-term trend that you're seeing, and in this quarter, as I say, amplified by a can shortage. Just to give you a sense on the regional front, we did moderate our share decline in the West. We were more price competitive in the quarter. And we saw a response to that, that gives us confidence as we continue to play with the price and volume balance, that we do have responsiveness in our portfolio. Unfortunately, the gains we made in the West were more than offset by lost sales in the East with the can shortage.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Dave, is it...","David Perkins","Is that helpful?","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. But the can shortage situation, is that pretty much done, and now you're back into meeting demands on the can side?","David Perkins","Yes, that is behind us. And as we look to next year, with the can line in year 2 and with advanced planning, we're confident in our ability to meet what seems to be a pretty strong trend in the market. As far as October is concerned, just to give you a sense there in what we're seeing, I mean, there's probably 2 key factors. We are cycling the strongest quarter from an industry perspective that we saw last year. So the industry, even taking out the 53rd-week effect, was up 1.8%. So it was a strong result, and that was behind very good weather that we're not benefiting from this year. And the NHL lockout is a major -- NHL is a major property for us. Hockey generates a lot of beer occasions in Canada, whether it's in bars, in home or in the venues. And it's a really important part of how we activate behind our power brands, Coors Light and Canadian. So we're obviously working to replace the hockey programming, but hockey would be the premier property. And on top, we lose the direct volume in the hockey venues that are ours.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just secondly, in Central Europe, just again, sort of the demand falloff that you saw in September because you talked about July being up high-single digits, so clearly, the quarter -- the late quarter trends were much weaker than we saw in the -- earlier in the quarter. So can you just give us some sense of what's happening both from a macro perspective as just well as from a competitive perspective? And then sort of in terms of what's happening with the macro being tougher in those markets, how are you thinking about the ability to maybe even extract more cost savings, particularly as you integrate the U.K. business into Central Europe and have a wholly integrated European division?","Peter S. Swinburn","So, Judy, I'll take the second part of that question first, and I'll let Mark address the first part. For the moment, we've put $50 million as a synergy number for Central Europe, and that's the number we're speaking to. As I alluded to in the script, we're starting with the reorganization in Central Europe and the U.K. But obviously, we need to make more cost moves within the business, and that will be something that we can talk about at a later date. So, Mark, you want to talk specifically about consumer demand and market share in Central Europe?","Mark Hunter","Sure. Judy, just to your very specifics, to start at macro level, I think what we saw as we went through the third quarter, really through the second half of August then in September, real kind of slowdown in consumer demand. Now clearly, we're currently investigating what we think is driving that. Probably at the highest level, what we are seeing is the GDP forecasts for, first of all, with the markets that we operate in turning in a negative direction versus the 2011 numbers. And certainly, in Serbia, Croatia, Hungary and Czech, we expect GDP to be actually negative by the end of 2012 on a full year basis. So there's clearly a macro sluggishness from a demand perspective, and that manifested itself in industry volumes. And I'll just pick a couple of markets to give you an example. So at the end of August, the Hungarian market was up about 2.5 points in volume; in September, it was down 5 points. Czech market was up just under a couple of points the end of August; and in September, it was down 7.5 points. So clearly, in September, consumers tightened their belt. Now clearly, to your second question, what does that mean competitively, well, those pressures are felt by us and all of our competitors. The good news is that in 5 of our 7 markets, we actually grew share, and in our biggest markets, we continued to grow our business, which was good news, and grow our pricing. And obviously, that manifested itself in a double-digit increase in our earnings, which is very, very positive. I think the one thing just to call out and flag to you is probably the Romanian market. So if you look at industry volume in Central Europe through the third quarter, our handling level looks reasonably -- volume is up about 4%. So 90% of that growth came in Romania. And it came in Romania in a very, very low margin segment, the value segment. And I think one of our competitors had already flagged the fact that they saw very, very high growth, but it had actually been margin dilutive on a Pan-European basis. We choose not to compete there, so we actually gave up some share in Romania as one of the 2 markets where we gave up some share. If you strip out Romania, industry was up by less than 1%. If you strip out Romania in our business, our volume was actually up by about 3%. So excluding the Romanian market, where there is that volatility in the value segment, I feel very, very pleased with our performance, as I say, strong earnings growth and share growth in 5 of the 7 markets. And we continue to manage our costs very effectively, both from an investment perspective and a G&A perspective. So I think the business is feeling very solid and competitively performing very strongly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So, Peter, given some of the volume struggles around the world really across your geographies, as well as market share issues and the difficult macro environment you cited, do you think you need to boost marketing spending going forward to drive a volume pickup in 2013? And also, how do you protect profit in that difficult environment? I'd love some clarity just on kind of prioritizing volume growth versus profit in your key markets at this point given the environment.","Peter S. Swinburn","Sure. Thanks very much. Well, as we flagged in the earnings, we're actually increasing our G&A marketing spend in the U.S. by a figure of around about $20 million. So the short answer is yes, we're taking some action. We did increase our marketing spend this year, which we flagged at the beginning of the year. In terms of how we're addressing it, I think Dave alluded to the fact -- and I think Tom did in the U.S. earnings call this morning, that most of our portfolios are skewed towards mainstream premium. And we suffer from not having enough exposure to above-premium. And what you'll see is both from -- in all of our innovation activity that we've undertaken over the last couple of years and going forward, we're very much skewed towards premiumizing the portfolio. And so we're looking to mix as being a big driver for us over a 2- to 3-year period. So if you look at some -- again, U.S. was talked about this morning, but if you looked at what we did in the U.K. this year with Carling Zest, that was very much a premium play. The Coors Light Iced T was a premium play. Aluminum Pints, it's selling at an index of 1 10 to 1 20 was a premium play, and so on. And so really, that's the way that we're dealing with it.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And when do you think you'll give us more clarity on the potential level of cost savings from the combination of the U.K. and Ireland business with Central Europe? And also, just can you give us a sense of the overall cost-cutting potential or productivity potential at your company as we look going forward versus recent trend, and if at some point you'll outline new longer-term cost savings goals across the company?","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes, we'll be in a position to give you much more detail, I would suspect, when we have our analyst call next year in New York, and so we can be much more definitive then. In terms of the overall approach, I mean, we've consistently said that we see cost saving as something that's an ongoing task within the business. We believe there is more cost to take out of the business, and we're actively seeking to do that at the moment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Gavin, on the cost of sales per hectoliter, I wonder if you could speak directionally as you look beyond the fourth quarter, whether it's fair to characterize the whole of Molson Coors as being in a less inflationary environment next year than you've been this year, and perhaps even remark whether a given region -- how a given region might compare to that overall performance.","Gavin Hattersley","Mark, sorry, I can't help you at this point in time. What we normally do is we give our cost of goods sold guidance for the year during our fourth quarter earnings call. So we'll be doing that for you in February of next year.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then probably a little bit more, Gavin or Peter or Mark, on the consolidation of Europe. Can you walk us through a little bit about how you're thinking has unfolded since you announced the StarBev transaction, how much the performance in September and October has motivated this decision to consolidate, and how much of this was other factors and part of the game plan when you announced the transaction?","Peter S. Swinburn","Sure, Mark, I'll take that. Short answer, no, it was not motivated or driven by anything that happened in September or October. We always planned to look at this and probably do it. It's pretty standard for most businesses to have a European platform, which -- the honest truth is we expected integration to be slower and take longer than we expected. We are -- really, this is a good news story because the integration has gone much more smoothly and has bedded in much more quickly than we expected. So we just feel we're in a position to be able to make this call earlier than we would've otherwise done, simple as that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've got 2 questions. One, just in Central Europe on the cost of goods per hectoliter or the input costs, is there anything different about that market that would cause -- I guess, what I'm trying to drive at is whether or not you're -- there is some difference in the way that you buy raw materials there, you're not hedged out as far -- where it would've -- where you would've seen an increase relative to what you were thinking back in July? Or was it just simply the type of raw materials or the type of costs that increased are the type that you can't hedge? Just try to make me understand whether there's something different about that market in terms of the way you buy raw materials than your other markets.","Peter S. Swinburn","Sure, I understand. Bryan, I think the best thing is I'll let Mark talk to the specific of what's driven the difference between our Q2 guidance and Q3 guidance. It's very simple and straightforward. I'll let Mark do that, and then maybe Gavin might want to come back in terms of hedging and what have you. So, Mark?","Mark Hunter","Yes. So in headline terms, I wouldn't point to anything that's materially different between how we buy in Central Europe versus other parts of our market. Relative to the guidance we gave in Q2, the only thing that is different has been really the issue with grain harvests across Europe cost, particularly in Romania and Serbia. And that's having an impact on costs as we move into Q4. Everything else is very much in line with the guidance that we offered.","Gavin Hattersley","And from a hedging point of view, Bryan, as you know, we've got a very comprehensive hedging program in the U.S., and we've got a solid and comprehensive growth hedging program in our other businesses. And our supply chain group is working to get Central Europe embedded in those programs. So I would say they're not quite at the same level from a hedging perspective as the rest of our businesses are, and we're getting there quite quickly.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, Peter, just as a follow-up to Dara's question earlier, I'd just go back to the Investor Day in March. I mean, the message that we took away -- one of the messages we took away was that they're trying to rebalance -- you're trying to rebalance the model so that we get to a point where we're seeing more of the profit growth driven by sales growth as opposed to being overly dependent on cost saves and that's sort of the motivation to increase the new product innovation, part of the motivation to get into the StarBev markets. And clearly, right now, we're not seeing the top line growth for a number of reasons. But just, I guess, as I listen to a new or some incremental cost savings potentially over the next 2 years, I just want to make sure that we're -- I'm clear that what's happening isn't that we're sort of losing faith in the ability to drive the top line and thus are going to focus more on cost savings, or as much as this is just something that you weren't ready to talk about in March, and it's still an imperative to drive the top line to sustainably drive the bottom line. I hope that's clear.","Peter S. Swinburn","No, it's very clear, Bryan, and it's a great point, and you've got it spot on. We -- in no way are we abandoning the top line. I mean, the business really has to show top line growth. It's a journey, though, so as I said earlier, a lot of what we're trying to do is to get the above-premium part of our overall portfolio moving in the right direction. We have undoubtedly suffered from a lack of consumer demand in a number of our markets in this quarter. But the cost-saving piece is just the other part of the triangle. We've consistently said that we will continue to look at cost savings and continue to drive down costs in the business. So really, it's not an either\/or, it's very much doing both of them.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","A quick question on Canada. With pricing for you guys up 3, I think your competitor was up 1.25, volumes were down, I guess if we back out Canada, we're down 3% in the quarter. So I mean, how sustainable is, I guess, the better pricing that we're seeing from others in the market, and how should we think about that going forward? And then a second question is on Coors Light Iced T. Obviously, you guys made a big deal about that. At the Analyst Day, can you just give us an update, I don't know, if it's -- what it's contributing to your business in terms of growth or consumer demand on that side?","Peter S. Swinburn","Thanks, Brett.","David Perkins","Yes, sure. On the pricing front, we have outpaced the competition, there's no question. It wouldn't have made sense to do anything differently given the shortages we were running. Our net pricing would have been about 2%, and then the balance was through mix. So we do have a meaningful premiumization effect in our business, and I think that is sustainable. Coors Light is a really good example of that. I mean, Coors Light has come out the end of the summer in line with our expectations. It was profitable in year 1 for us despite a fairly aggressive investment behind it. And it appears to have had a halo effect on the mother brand because Coors Light itself has performed better than it has in recent years even. So we're quite happy with what we've seen overall there. And I think it is indicative of what we're able to do through premiumization. Look, how that plays out in terms of the price volume mix and the competitive dynamic, we watch that from day to day, but what's happened in this quarter was the right thing to have happen. Does that answer both your questions adequately?","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","It does. If I could just have one follow-up, so without the NHL -- I'm just trying to think about how we model this in the fourth quarter -- there's certainly going -- clearly going to be a volume impact on it. Is there less marketing dollars going in because of, I guess, the loss of the ability to activate against NHL?","David Perkins","Well, I wouldn't give guidance on what we're doing in Q4 on marketing spend. What I'd say is we are looking for and are working behind substitute programming to ensure that we remain competitive in the quarter. But as I said earlier, there is no doubt that this property is quite unique in its impact both on industry volume and on our share. And so to think that we can actually replace it in the short term, I think, is unrealistic.","Operator","Your next question -- sorry, since that person got out of queue, there are no further questions in queue at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.","Peter S. Swinburn","Thank you, Chrissy. Thank you for everybody for joining us today and for your interest in the business, and we look forward to speaking to you again at the fourth quarter earnings call. Thanks very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors. Please go ahead.","Mark Hunter","Thank you, Carmen. Hello and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call. And many thanks for joining us today. With me on the call this morning, we have Gavin Hattersley, CFO of Molson Coors and currently the Interim CEO of Miller Coors and from Molson Coors we have Stewart Glendinning, our Canada CEO, Simon Cox, our CEO for European business; Kandy Anand, our International CEO; Sam Walker, our Chief Legal and People Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, our VP of Investor Relations.","In the second quarter our underlying pretax earnings on a constant currency basis increased 5.9% driven by positive net pricing along with the results of cost savings initiatives.","Due to higher tax rate and unfavorable foreign currency our underlying after-tax income decreased by 9.9%. We increased the gross margins in the U.S., Canada and Europe and grew net sales revenue for hectoliter in the U.S. and Canada in local currency. Overall Europe NSR per hectoliter declined in local currency, but if we exclude the impact of the terminated Modelo and Heineken contracts, NSR per hectoliter increased in all of our major Europe markets apart from Serbia. ","We also expanded global underlying operating margins, driven by our U.S. and Canada businesses. In the quarter we continued to implement our strategy of driving brand-led profit growth, meaningful cash generation and disciplined cash and capital allocation. We have invested consistently behind our core brands, with for example Coors Light in the U.S. growing share of segment, we made progress in transforming our portfolio toward above-premium, craft and cider and we expanded the depth and reach of our international brands in fast-growing markets. And we have continued to increase our commercial capability.","Additionally this year, we have repatriated Staropramen lager to our U.K. portfolio and purchased the Mount Shivalik Breweries business in India and the Rekorderlig cider brand distribution rights in the U.K. and Ireland. These acquisitions give us high potential platforms to grow our business in key markets. We also made a decision to substantially restructure our China business as we focused on accelerating the performance of our overall International business and we have closed our Alton brewery in the U.K. as we continue to restructure our U.K. supply chain.\" ","Additionally, we remained resolute on utilizing PACC as our key business-decision framework, using our cash to reward investors and ensure a healthy balance sheet, reducing costs to provide front-end firepower, and placing smart bets that deliver brand-led growth opportunities. Our strategy is underpinned by highly engaged, passionate and inspired people with the ambition to be First Choice in the eyes of our consumers and our customers.","This progress in the quarter was against the backdrop of continued volume pressure in our largest markets, significant impact from foreign currency movements, a higher tax rate, and terminations of business contracts in the U.K. and Canada, as previously communicated. ","Other 2nd quarter performance headlines are as follows. Our net sales per hectoliter decreased 2.2% in constant currency, driven by sales mix changes within our Europe and International businesses, including the impact of terminating the Modelo brands and Heineken contract-brewing agreements in the U.K. These factors were partially offset by positive global pricing and revenue management in local currency.","Constant currency net sales decreased 3.3% due to lower volume in Europe and Canada and negative mix in Europe and International, again partially offset by positive net pricing. And by adding in the additional effect of foreign currency, reported net sales declined 15.4%.","Coors Light volume declined 2.3% globally, driven by declines in the U.S. and Canada, partially offset by high-single-digit volume growth outside North America. Our global craft portfolio grew volume high-single digits in the quarter, and our cider portfolio grew more than 30%.","Worldwide volume declined 1.9%, including the impact of the termination of our Miller brands agreement in Canada and the Modelo brands contract in the U.K. Underlying pretax income of $327.9 million was down 0.9% but increased 5.9% on a constant currency basis.","Underlying after-tax income decreased 9.9%, driven by a higher tax rate, which was cycling a large discrete tax benefit a year ago, and unfavorable foreign currency. These factors were partially offset by positive net pricing and the results of cost savings initiatives.","Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $455.3 million, a 4.4% decrease from a year ago, again due to foreign currency movements.","Additionally, we began to implement our four year $1 billion stock buy-back program, with more than 672,000 Class B common shares repurchased in the 2nd quarter, and another $50 million of cash used early in the 3rd quarter for Class B stock repurchases.","In terms of regional highlights, in the U.S. underlying earnings increased 8% due to lower brewing and packaging materials and fuel costs, as well as higher net pricing and supply chain cost savings. Volume was lower in a weak 2nd quarter for the U.S. beer industry. Overall, Miller Coors achieved strong financial results, along with continued progress in transforming our U.S. portfolio toward the above-premium segment. In core brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite both grew share of segment, while Coors Banquet grew volume and market share. Our Above Premium portfolio, led by Blue Moon Belgian White, Leinenkugel\u2019s and the Redd\u2019s family, grew in the quarter. ","In Canada, underlying pretax income grew 4.3% in constant currency, due to positive pricing and mix, as well as substantial cost savings, despite the negative impact of terminating our Miller brands agreement at the end of March this year. Including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency, underlying earnings declined by 5.5%. Canada sales to retail or STRs, declined 8.1%, with the biggest individual driver being the termination of the Miller contract. ","In core brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian volumes declined in the quarter, in part due to industry weakness in their highest-share regions. In above premium, Coors Banquet delivered strong volume and share growth in the 2nd quarter, as did Mad Jack Apple Lager, Molson Canadian Cider and Strongbow Cider -- and we delivered double-digit growth from our Granville Island craft brands. ","In Europe, excluding the impact of currency movements and the terminated Modelo and Heineken contracts, our Europe underlying pretax income would have increased in the 2nd quarter, driven by higher sales volume, positive pricing and lower costs. Europe business underlying income decreased 21.5% in the quarter, entirely due to the impact of unfavorable foreign currency and the terminated contracts. We were pleased to see some recovery -- and higher beer volumes -- in the areas of Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia that were badly affected by severe flooding a year ago. In core brands, Carling trends improved from earlier in the year, and Ozujsko and Bergenbier grew volume and segment share in their core markets. And our craft and above premium portfolio continued to perform well, with Coors Light, Doom Bar and Staropramen outside of Czech all achieving strong growth in the quarter.","Our International business again delivered double-digit volume growth in the second quarter with triple-digit volume growth in India, due to the strong performance of our existing India business and our acquisition of Mount Shivalik Breweries earlier this year, along with double-digit growth for Coors Light in Latin America. During the quarter, as part of our International profitability goal, we announced our decision to substantially restructure our existing China business, which resulted in the recognition of $3.6 million of price promotion expense. This additional promotional expense and unfavorable foreign currency were the primary driver of the $2.1 million increase in International's underlying pretax loss versus a year ago. These factors were partially offset by higher volume and lower marketing spending.","Now I'll turn to over to Gavin to give additional second quarter financial highlights and perspective on the rest of 2015. Gavin? ","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks, Mark and hello, everybody. In financial highlights, underlying free cash flow for the first half of 2015 totaled $241.1 million which represents a $90.6 million decrease versus the first six months of 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by a lower underlying after-tax income, negative foreign currency and less benefit from working capital changes, including higher cash paid for taxes.","Our first half free cash flow included the following factors, $198.1 million of operating cash flow and $248 million of net add-backs for our discretionary U.K. pension contribution in January. Miller Coors investments in businesses and the cash impact of special items. Investing cash outflows included $139.8 million of capital spending. Our underlying free cash flow included $692.9 million of cash distributions from Miller Coors and $758.1 million of cash invested in Miller Coors. A detailed reconciliation of our underlying free cash flow is available in our earnings release distributed this morning.","Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $3.138 billion and cash and cash equivalents totaled $413.8 million, resulting in net debt of $2.724 billion, which is $430.4 million lower than a year ago. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results for the quarter. ","Looking forward to the balance of 2015. The following full year forward guidance is unchanged from last quarter. Our annual target for underlying free cash flow is $550 million, plus or minus 10%, at July 31 foreign currency rates. We expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million in 2015, including our 42% of Miller Coors contributions. We anticipate 2015 pension expense of approximately $27 million, including our portion of Miller Coors. We expect capital spending to be approximately $300 million. We expect our 2015 MG&A expense in Corporate to be approximately $110 million.","Our consolidated net interest expense to be approximately $120 million, which is based on foreign exchange rates and hedging positions at the end of the second quarter and our 2015 underlying effective tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 22%. After this year, we expect our underlying tax rate to be near the low end of our long-term range of 20% to 24% for the next few years, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions. ","In 2015 cost outlook, we continue to expect Canada cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a mid-single digit rate in local currency and International business COGS to decrease at a low double-digit range per hectoliter. Miller Coors, however, now expects 2015 cost goods sold per hectoliter to be approximately in-line with the year before versus pervious guidance of the low single-digit increase, with the change driven by lower fuel and commodity costs.","In Europe, we now anticipate a low-single digit decrease in cost of goods sold per hectoliter this year in local currency, versus a mid-single digit decrease previously, primarily due to increased sales of higher-cost above premium brands. ","And finally, regarding the profit and cash headwind from foreign currency that we expect this year: If we apply foreign exchange rates at the end of July to our results for the second half of 2014, it would reduce underlying pretax earnings for that period by more than $43 million -- and the impact on cash would have been even larger. By adding the foreign exchange impact on pretax results for the first half of this year, we arrive at a full-year foreign currency impact of more than $70 million versus our 2014 consolidated pretax results. We have taken steps in recent years to mitigate some of our foreign currency exposures via debt structures and hedging.","At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap up and the Q&A. Mark?","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Gavin. In addition to the foreign currency headwind that Gavin just discussed, our results in the balance of this year will continue to be challenged by the termination of three major business contracts, which we anticipate will have a full-year 2015 profit impact of $40 million pretax, as well as a higher effective tax rate. Additionally and importantly, we plan to significantly step up our portfolio investments across all of our businesses. These investments will have a particularly negative impact on third quarter and overall second half bottom-line results, but we expect them to provide benefits long term, as we focus on delighting our consumers and our customers to ensure we are the first choice in the geographies and segments where we choose to play. ","Regionally, in the U.S., we are driving a handful of priorities. Job number one is to transform our portfolio and rediscover volume growth. And to do this, we have three focus areas. Firstly, taking share and growing our American light lagers, Coors Light and Miller Lite. As part of Coors Light's overhaul, we are rolling out a contemporary visual identity across all packaging, and we have introduced new national television advertising that emphasizes Coors Light\u2019s Rocky Mountain heritage.","Secondly, we'll continue to premiumise the portfolio and further develop Above Premium offerings that have the potential to build scale quickly and sustainably. Examples include the successful launches of Blue Moon White IPA and Leinenkugel\u2019s Grapefruit Shandy, along with the expansion of Blue Moon Cinnamon Horchata 6-packs, as well as the introduction of Leinenkugel\u2019s new seasonal release, Harvest Patch Shandy. And then thirdly, we will simplify and clarify our below-premium portfolio offering.","Job Number Two in the US is to improve our commercial capability, including winning an on-premise and increasing the relevance of our brands in this critical channel, where brands critically are built, and finally Job Number Three is to ensure that our cost base is competitive and fit for the future.","Consistent with our priorities, in the 2nd half of this year, we intend to invest significantly in our brands and information technology, and as a result we expect our US underlying operating margins for full-year 2015 to be relatively flat versus prior year.","In Canada, we continue to invest in our core brands and Above Premium, including Craft, imports, cider and flavored malt beverages. For our core brands, a new ad campaign and increased focus on commercial execution on Coors Light will provide the foundation to help improve trends for our largest brand in Canada. Also, solid creative execution and integrated supporting programs for Molson Canadian, particularly related to our Anything for Hockey and Beer Fridge advertising, are starting to create a renewed bond between drinkers and our second-largest brand. In the 2nd half of this year, we plan to invest aggressively in these programs. ","In Above Premium, the termination of the Miller brands contract will present a headwind for our business through to the 1st quarter of next year. Despite this, the strong performance of the Coors Banquet, Mad Jack Apple Lager, Rickard\u2019s Radler and Molson Canadian Cider brands are influencing the transformation of our portfolio toward the above-premium segment, and our expanded partnership for the Heineken, Dos Equis, Sol and Strongbow brands is delivering volume and share. We also recently announced that Blue Moon Belgian White, the number-one selling craft beer in the United States, is coming to Canada this month as Belgian Moon. ","In Europe, we will cycle the terminated Modelo and Heineken contracts in the UK for the balance of this year. The Modelo brands volume represented about 1 share point in the UK for us last year. The repatriation of the Staropramen brand rights for the UK business and securing the U.K. distribution rights for Rekorderlig cider are part of the plans we said we would execute to transform our portfolio and mitigate the impact of these contract losses. Starting in 2016, we expect these two brands to add more than 350,000 hectoliters of above Premium volume annually to our Europe business and provide attractive growth potential for the future. ","In combination with the integration of the Franciscan Well craft brands in Ireland and the acquisition of the brewing and kegging operation of Thomas Hardy\u2019s Burtonwood Brewery in England, we now have a broad range of consumer and customer offerings in the above-premium, craft and cider segments across the U.K. and Ireland. Also, we continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across Europe to ensure that these critical brands remain relevant and contemporary for our consumers. The positive momentum we are currently seeing in the Carling, Ozujsko, Bergenbier and Borsodi brands illustrates that this investment strategy is working. Additionally, we intend to explore further opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our European operations over the coming months to unlock more resources to invest in driving top-line and bottom-line growth.","Our International business is focused on attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant-currency basis and accelerating our overall growth and expansion into new and existing markets. We will continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light and develop Coors 1873 in Latin America. We will also continue to build on Staropramen\u2019s momentum in greater Europe, recognizing that volume for this brand in the UK and Ireland will transfer at the end of this year from our International business to our Europe operation. Additionally, we will augment rapid growth in our existing India business with growth from our newly acquired Mount Shivalik Breweries operation.","Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the 3rd quarter. In the U.S. through July 25th, STRs decreased a low-single digit rate. In Canada through July 31th, STRs were down high-single digits, however excluding the Miller brands last year, our Canada STRs for this period decreased at a low single-digit rate. ","In Europe in July, sales volume was up high single-digits, driven by growth in 10 out of 11 countries in the region. ","Our International sales volume, including royalty volume, increased at a double-digit rate in July.","As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead. ","So to summarize our discussion today, our 2nd quarter financial results reflect continued volume pressure in our largest markets, significant impact from foreign currency movements, a higher tax rate, and terminations of business contracts in the UK and Canada. We expect these headwinds to continue in the balance of this year, along with a significant step-up in our brand investments across all of our businesses, which we expect to negatively impact our short-term profit but provide longer-term benefits to our financial performance. Going forward, we will continue to implement our strategy of driving brand-led profit growth, meaningful cash generation and disciplined cash and capital allocation. Over time, we expect this strategy to help us unlock opportunities for growth in Molson Coors Brewing Company's top-line, bottom-line and long-term shareholder value.","Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, 1 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via web cast on our Web site.","Additionally, we hope to see many of you at the Barclays Global Consumer Staples Conference in Boston on Thursday, September 10.","So, at this point, Carmen, we would like to open it up for questions please. Thank you. Carmen?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from the line Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Judy Hong","My first question is on Canada. So, it seems like you lost share but you\u2019re pricing and profitability was relatively healthy. So, can you just talk a little bit about your market share performance and kind of your balancing share versus profit, it sounds like may did the investments we'll step up in the back half, so would you expect the market share performance to improve and is that really more of near term priority in Canada?","Mark Hunter","Hi, Judy. Let me offer you just a couple of comments and then Stewart can pick up on the detail. I think the encouraging thing in Canada as you mentioned is our pricing performance was strong and having now secure de-pricing performance clearly, it gives us option as we move into the second half of the year, a signal very clearly that we do intends step up the level of our commercial investments behind out portfolio. Stewart, do you want to talk about some of the priorities as we go through the second half of the year?","Stewart Glendinning","Sure, Mark. Look, Judy, we're not going to give any specific guidance on where we think share will end up. I think there is always a careful balance between share and the price. We've got the flexibility in the back half for being able to choose that, one area of note, I'd just point out is our conscious decision with Coors Light in Quebec in the second quarter to take the price up to match the 5% beers that's the one market in Canada, where the 4% beers have historically have been priced underneath to the 5% beers. So we sought to address, that was a really specific decision. In other parts of the country, we saw some fairly aggressive pricing and price spending and my team is looking at those tactics for the back half. ","Judy Hong","Okay. So would you attribute some of the market share losses to the healthy pricing and the more aggressive competition or is it sort of the ongoing challenges that you've been stating?","Mark Hunter","I wouldn't say that the answer that is, yes. There were placing where higher prices have translated into lower ship.","Judy Hong","Okay. And then Gavin just two questions for you. One is just on the U.S. and sorry, I missed the Miller Coors calls but I think one of the priorities that we're hearing more from you is just simplifying and streamlining the low premium segment and recognize that you've got a long tail there and I guess, historically some of the challenges that you've padded, just working with your distributors and making sure that you've got a plan in place. So, can you just elaborate on the plan there? And then on the financial side, the free cash flow guidance this year just remind me what\u2019s embedded in terms of the currency impact and any other kind of puts and takes that\u2019s changed since your last guidance?","Gavin Hattersley","Okay. So, Judy, let me take the last one first, from a free cash flow point of view, I'll just remind you that our guidance is $550 million plus or minus 10%. And we haven't been specific about the foreign exchange impact on that underlying free cash flow other than to say that the 70 million I referred to from a profit point of view, the impact from a cash point of view would be even higher than that. And if I can just remind you of some of the impacts beyond FX because obviously foreign exchange is a big part of that, but we did have our strong push on working capital in 2014, which over delivered for us and if you recall some of our larger customers paid early and then we do have a higher capital investment plans, some of the cost savings programs and we have higher cash tax payments, as our cash tax rates gets closer to our underlying tax rates. So that's really the cash flow side.","And let me just talk my Molson Coors cap off and put the Miller Coors cap on. ","Mark Hunter","Below premium.","Gavin Hattersley","Below premium was the other question. Look I mean we all continue to lose share of industry and shares of segments in our economy brands and we are reviewing our long term strategy for these brands. We know we have the ability to win in the economy segment for example in 2014 and the first half of this year Steel Reserve has been up in mid-single digits, in large part due to the introduction of the Flavored Steel Reserve Alloy Series. So we're going to get sharper from our below premium economy segment point of view, we're going to simplify and I'm not ready to share those details publicly. We do have our full distributor meeting with our distributors coming up and we'll elaborate a little bit more then.","Judy Hong","Got it.","Mark Hunter","Judy, the only thing I would add, I mean your specific question was around the relationship with our distributors and below premium brands that job number one is for the team at Miller Coors to really clarify our below premium portfolio strategy and align that with our retailers, our distributors will then benefit from the impact of that clarity. That's a work in progress and Gavin and the team will be taking that to market in the near term.","Judy Hong","Got it, okay, thank you. ","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.","Vivien Azer","My first question has to do with your price mix realization in Europe. I recognize that there are a lot of moving pieces as some of your previous partnerships unwind, but given the change in your COGS outlook, driven by premium mix shift can you offer a little bit more color on what your price mix or price per hectoliter realization would have looked like on an underlying basis in Europe in the quarter?","Mark Hunter","Vivien, I'll let Simon talk to the detail, just you know from a context point, one of the things I referred to in the script was actually in local currency we saw pricing growth in a per hectoliter basis. The context in Europe as we go from local currency to Euros or from sterling to Euros and then onto dollar, so it can get a little bit complex. Simon, you want to offer just a bit more detail as to how you are reading the mix across countries and across our portfolio?","Simon Cox","Yes, thanks Vivien. As Mark said when you talk across 11 countries with a fair degree of movement in some of them and the impact to contract manufacturing and the loss of Modelo is complex but let me try and simplify it for you. I think the first thing to say is that pricing in this quarter overall in Europe was up 0.6%, so the negative was really the mix and again the mix comes back to the loss of the contracts. If you take those impacts away then our net sales revenue per hectoliter was up in 10 out of our 11 markets with the exception being Serbia. So overall, based on the fact that actually we did -- again if you strip out the Modelo brands grow volumes, we were quite pleased that the pricing and volume mix equation with pricing being up 0.6% and net sales revenue per hectoliter being up in 10 of the 11 markets. So overall we think our pricing was pretty solid particularly when combined with our volume performance.","Vivien Azer","That's very helpful.","Mark Hunter","And Vivien I would just now refer you back to the fact that we've seen -- certainly our volumes across a majority of our markets and through July continue to move positively. So I think the team are getting the balance right between price and volume virtually across all of our markets.","Vivien Azer","Absolutely, no that's great. My second question has to do with Canada and the industry backdrop, you know one of your key competitors reported earnings and actually he had characterized the Canadian market, how the industry is, having had good performance in the quarter which stands in contrast a little bit I think to the way that you guys characterize the market. So can you could offer any more context, is that just a function of relative geographic mix or is there anything underlying kind of the discrepancy in that commentary.","Mark Hunter","Stewart, do you want to pick that up and just give a feedback [ph] of the industry backdrop?","Stewart Glendinning ","I'm not sure Vivien where you saw the discrepancy, certainly we saw an industry that was healthy, in positive territory. I think from our stand point we had two things going on in our business when you look at the underlying performance. Our pricing was stronger and we certainly weren\u2019t affected by geographic mix, when you look across the country the west was much stronger than the east. And if you looked at Ontario and Quebec and the Atlantic provinces, all of those declined. Those are the provinces in which we are strongest.","Vivien Azer","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from Ian Shackleton with Nomura.","Ian Shackleton","Yes, good morning gentlemen. Two questions, firstly in Europe, certainly the volume numbers look pretty good, I just want to know whether you could give out market shares across the major markets, I know it\u2019s a relatively easy comp to the flooding, but you do seem to have done pretty well and perhaps you can give us an idea on shares. On Canada I mean you gave us the figure of minus 8.1 and then say that half of that due to the Miller brand. Is there nothing coming back from the extended Heineken contract yet? Is that something still to come or does that have a reasonable impact, positive impact on this quarter?","Mark Hunter","Hi Ian, I'll ask both Simon and Stewart just to talk to the specifics. I think it's fair to say within Europe that we don't [indiscernible] into the share by country. At also Europe\u2019s level we did lose a little bit, about 0.33%, but than if you reversed out the impact of the loss of the Modelo then actually, it holds a relatively flat year on year. Simon, anything you would add to that?","Simon Cox","Not a lot, Mark, because as you say we don't intend to speak to that by country. If you do reverse have that in Modelo volumes and then aggregate it back up, we did actually slightly grow share across the region, which is a setting combination with what we regarded to be pretty decent pricing performance and this is what we're seeing in the market in terms of discounting, then we were pretty happy with our volume performance. So, very slight share gaining, if you reverse out the impact of losing the Modelo contracts.","Mark Hunter","Yes, probably the only other thing I'd add, Ian is that, in a number of markets within economy segment have grown pretty rapidly over the course of the last 12 months. And we are responding to that, but certainly not leaping to that and if we do how many share weakness anywhere it would tend to be in the economy segment, which is obviously lower margin segment. So, we're playing I think a very balanced and responsive game across the markets in Europe.","Steward, do you want to talk about it some of the emerging tailwinds in Canada's as you look at the broader portfolio?","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, absolutely, I mean, Ian you asked a question about losing the Miller brands and picking up the intensive [ph] brands, certainly we've had a good start with intensive brands but they're much, much smaller than the loss of the intensive brand. So, I don\u2019t know if you want more on that, but that's sort of intensive brands are a fraction of the Miller size.","Ian Shackleton","So, just to be clear, these intensive brands can be quite slow, we don't want to see step up in that seeing Q3free going forward. It will be over the next few years, will it?","Stewart Glendinning","We think we got some really good brands and of course we know that we can grow them, but we're growing off a very small base","Ian Shackleton","Understood. And just quick follow up, just getting premium back for the UK, it's called a big amount, I think, you're paying there, which is quite surprise to me, but when do you actually get that back, is that come in from 2016?","Mark Hunter","Yes and the majority of the deal is that we get the brand back from full on the 28th of December this year. So, effectively yes, for 2016 onwards.","Stewart Glendinning","Ian, other thing I'd add is, as you would expect the repay interstation of the startup from a backend to the UK has been running through our PACC model and it makes absolute sense for our business on the basis of utilization of PACC based on existing arrangement and the new arrangement and with that new arrangement will open up to us in terms of the growth profile of the brand","Ian Shackleton","I mean, I think, you've mentioned the figure 350,000 hectoliters, which should start [indiscernible], is that split 50:50 at the moment? ","Mark Hunter","I don't recall, if we mentioned this, Ina.","Ian Shackleton","We know you have the opportunity.","Mark Hunter","Let\u2019s just stick to the 150,000 hec on a full year basis in 2016 and obviously we've got an ambition to more that forward from there, but we open again the detail at this stage.","Ian Shackleton","Very good. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from this line John Faucher with JP Morgan. ","John Faucher","Two questions here, the first is can you just give us some rough idea of the magnitude of the incremental investment, just showing us an idea as we look to try to model out the balance of the year and then a second is little bit more sort of Nebulas [ph] from that standpoint potentially, but either seems to be a greater sense of urgency with you guys in terms of looking a lot of the productivity particularly related to Canada and then looking at some of the changes that are going on at Miller Coors, is there something -- do you feel like that's a fair assessment, if there is a greater sense of urgency and if so, what do you think is driving that, because it\u2019s something that investors seem to be picking up on. Thanks.","Mark Hunter","John, let me take your second question first then Gavin can talk on the specifics on incremental investment or rather than lack of specifics increments of investment. On the second point, I've been very clear that when I commented the role that there is no fundamental change in our strategy but I'm very keen for our business to run harder and faster, and I've talked I think very consistently about the need for us to accelerate our brand building capabilities and performance faster and importantly to improve our capability at the frontend of the business. That is now our working trend, we've rolled our whole fuels sales execution model across all of the sales force in the UK and Canada. So that\u2019s hundreds of people are now changing their behaviors, their routines and we're measuring people in a different way, around both effectiveness and efficiency.","So, really starting to work harder to unlocking further growth potential in our portfolio as we continue to build that portfolio out and then parallel to that, containing to drive for a new fit for future cost base in the organization. So, I'm very pleased with how the teams have responded and I'm pleased that you're picking up that sense of urgency. It\u2019s not nebulas, it\u2019s important. ","Gavin do you want to talk about the marketing investments?","Gavin Hattersley","Sure, John thanks. We're not going to give specifics on that, but what I can said is that we are going to be increasing our marketing spend meaningfully in the U.S. and also in Canada and Internationally. We also -- are particularly in the U.S. have some significant business transformation cost in the back half, you know where we have had some go trials [ph] of our new systems and earlier this year and late last year. We've got some really big one coming forward in the back half and obviously that carries a certain level of cost associated with it.","But as to giving you specifics, no, we're not going to do that.","John Faucher","And should we, should we expect that to be more media related, sponsorships, sort of, all of the above? Any just sort of rough ideas in terms of what buckets it could all go into?","Mark Hunter","John, as I mentioned we do have the Coors Light overall which we're in the process of doing at the moment, which is the new contemporary visual identity across all packaging. We've introduced the national television advertising behind Coors Light's Rocky Mountain heritage. We're going to put -- continue to put firepower behind Miller Lite's heritage program which we're very pleased with. We got the styled bottle from 1975 which is actually just gone into market which we're very excited about. We're going to continue to put money in the Above Premium and the craft portfolio's, Blue Moon White IPO for example, we've got the new Leinenkugel seasonal release that's coming up, Harvest Patch Shandy, we've got Redds. I mean I could on and on and on, John so I guess what I'm saying is it's more, I guess it will be weighted more towards media in the back half, yes.","John Faucher","Excellent, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Financial.","Mark Swartzberg","My question, really two, one's a follow on to John's and it's simply the incremental spend. Is it something that you had planned in your budget at the start of the year or is this based on things you're seeing here as the year progresses? And then I had an unrelated question.","Gavin Hattersley","Yes, I mean I would say largely in the business it was planned and I would say in the US we probably shaping it up to even a little more than we'd originally planned given some of the activities that we want to do Mark but broadly I would say it was in line.","Mark Hunter","I think that's fair Mark and obviously as we've seen a little bit of benefit comes through on the COGS line and in the U.S. is given us the opportunity to make some choices and we're making the right choice which is to further invest behind our brand portfolio, because we're very clear we want to get the business, really claim to win in the U.S. So we're in a position where we can make those choices and I think that the right choices for the long term health of our broad business.","Mark Swartzberg","Got it, okay great. And then with the U.S., JV I may have missed at the very beginning, I missed the opening comments but is there any update on the transition to a permanent CEO there?","Mark Hunter","Let me give you a couple of headlines, so both Allen and I have been working very hard from a recruitment perspective, have made good progress, we're both delighted with the way that Gavin has landed within the business on an interim basis and the way the team have rallied behind him and the changes that he has already implemented in the business, so I'm confident we should be in a position -- certainly in the near term to start to really confirm how we're going to move forward on a permanent basis. So more to follow, but as I'm sure you'd expect I'm not to start getting into people's career developments on a call like this Mark, but making good progress overall.","Mark Swartzberg","Okay, great, thank you guys.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.","Rob Ottenstein ","Great, Gavin, a first question. Given the pretty remarkable success of Constellation, with the Mexican brands, what impact has that had on the pricing environment in the U.S., particularly in the light of the fact that in a lot of states the gap now is very low between their brands and the premium brands and there's two possibilities here. One is, it looks in certain states that Constellation is becoming a price leader and they're taking some pretty, an ultra-aggressive price in California so that would be positive, the other way of looking at is, is you know there's been a lot of market share lost to them and that could create more competitive pricing dynamics. So just wondering if first off if you could kind of give us a sense of you know the pricing environment in the US and how things may have changed because of the success they've had.","Gavin Hattersley","Thanks Robert, I mean that's quite a question. So I think maybe just of, there's no question that the Mexican imports are playing in the, in somewhat of the same space, refreshing and insatiable [ph] space that the American light lagers are. The good news is that demonstrates that there's a continued relevance of refreshing and insatiable lager beers for the beer drinkers and with Miller Lite and Coors Light we think we've got two great brands that can grow volume and share and compete with them and particularly given some of the great sales and marketing programs that we've got coming. From a pricing point of view I'm obviously not going to you about what our strategy is, what I can tell is that we worked very hard over the last five weeks to develop a very clear point of view on pricing which has been led by Kevin Doyle and the team and that's a pricing strategy that we're communicating with our distributors. So we had a clear point of view, I'm obviously not going to share it, but just remember we do follow that pricing strategy that\u00a0is local in nature, it's varies by brand-by-brand and it's varies market-by-markets and more detail in than Robert, I can't give you.","Rob Ottenstein ","No, I'm not looking for your pricing strategy, I\u2019m more in terms of your assessments of the pricing environment versus cost. And so do you think, I think, we're seeing signs that Constellation is starting to become a price leader in certain markets, here at 3% price increase in California, do you think there is the chance of a perhaps a greater umbrella effect from them, than in prior years?","Mark Hunter","Yes, look Robert, I mean I don't think my answer\u2019s going to be any different other than that we have a clear pricing strategy that we're not going to share publically. That's all about all I\u2019m prepared to say on that particular topic. ","Rob Ottenstein ","Okay. I would, I got it. And maybe an easier question, you talked about a couple of years ago, your move in the economy segment to PET, can you give us, I guess, a sense of where that stands now or are you a 100% national and your general assessment of whether that's been a success or not?","Mark Hunter","We are not a 100% national, no, but we are on track with the plan that we have in place for that rollout and then so far we're pleased with that, Robert. ","Rob Ottenstein ","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic with SIG.","Pablo Zuanic","Hello, everyone. Look, I have two questions. Can you -- just remind us if you can please in terms of the right of refusal mechanics in the event that you're able to buy the other half of the Miller Coors and you own actually 58%, if you can just go through that. And Gavin question for you, in very basic terms, if we think about [indiscernible] top line versus profit margin expansion, I would argue that [indiscernible] there was a lot of improvement in terms of a broad portfolio on top line momentum relative to the industry, but that margins had not improved much, will there be any difference in terms of way that you're doing things right now because given all the changes you've implemented, but I'd like to get more color whether, there is any noise yet in terms of focusing Modelo margins, I mean the past, and less on top line, thanks."," [Multiple speakers] ","Gavin Hattersley","I'd take issue with one thing with one thing you said there, Pablo, because under Tom\u2019s leadership, we actually expanded our operating margins almost double since the beginning of the joint ventures. I think we've been pretty successful from that perspective. From a portfolio transformation point of view, I would say, we've made really nice progress under his leadership as well and we're going to continue to focus on transforming our portfolio. We need to take share of the American light lager segments, we need to continue to put premium onto the portfolio and develop the above premium offerings and we're working very hard for that and I think we've made good progress and I'm going to continue to focus on that in a very deliberate focused and bold way.","Pablo Zuanic","At that point, could there be any changes to the medium term profit margin guidance outlook for Miller Coors and this time also [indiscernible] provide that, but you said something that I would be hearing a new on some point?","Gavin Hattersley","There has been no update to the guidance that was previously given Pablo.","Pablo Zuanic","Thanks, and second question.","Mark Hunter","I think let me just add to Gavin's comment, I think, we've been very clear about the three priorities areas within the business, a lot of that continues a good work that Tom and the team did. And looks to accelerate that over the course of the life of our long range plan. So, with regard to other question, obviously all of that information is in our filings from late 2007 and mid-2008. As to the opportunity and clearly it\u2019s purely speculative, what's that right for us to secure a bigger share of the joint venture within the U.S., there is a right of first offer and last offer and some other associated rights, but the detail buying that's in all of the public filings, which I'd refer you to rather than get into them on this call.","Thanks for your questions. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. ","Bryan Spillane","I guess follow up questions, one -- and I might miss this earlier in the call, but just in terms of the your outlook on what the effective foreign exchange will be on pre-tax profits, I think, after the last quarter, we were looking at about 55 million for the year, is that still the right number or is your outlook on the effect from FX changed at all?","Mark Hunter","I think, what I say, Bryan, was that, if you have to plan foreign exchange rates at the end of July to our results for the second half of last year and it would have reduced our underlying pretax savings by more than $43 million and so, if you add on to that, the actual foreign exchange impact in the first half of this year is about $27 million and the impact would be more than $70 million year-over-year.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. So the --.","Mark Hunter"," That's probably what I've said last time. ","Bryan Spillane","Okay, alright, that helps. Thank you and then I guess the only other question I'd have just been trying to frame how things have progressed through the course of this year versus maybe what you were thinking earlier in the year. Sounds to me like volume in Europe, when you strip out the effect of losing the contracts has actually maybe been a little bit better. And it sounds like maybe volume in Canada has been a little bit worse, and then in the U.S. maybe you've got a little bit better cost-to-goods environment. Is that generally right, am I missing something there in terms of just -- in terms of the smaller pieces, what's been a little better or worse than what you were thinking?","Mark Hunter","I'm not sure I would characterize it like that Bryan, I think we're pleased with our overall performance in Europe and as I mentioned if you reverse out the loss of the Modelo brands our shares increased slightly, and certainly the last couple of months through June and July you heard me mention our July STRs, we're seeing you know relatively strong volume growth so that's encouraging and clearly we're right in the middle of peak selling season at the moment and we're up against the impact of the floods from last year, so there's still quite a volatility in the marketplace, so I don't think we're in a different place to what we assumed. And certainly within Canada, sure it's been very clear that stripping out the loss of the Miller brands, there's couple of areas that have, we will look at fixing as we go through the second half of this year or the volume impact as we\u2019ve adjusted pricing in Quebec on Coors Light and just a couple of trading tactics as well.","But strategically, I feel we're exactly where we anticipated being but you know this is always a game of strategy and tactics and a couple of our tactics will adjust as we go through the second half. But I think the critical thing is back to your first question on FX, we're looking at a $70 million FX headwind as we flagged, we've also flagged up $40 million on the contract losses and we've been very clear that with the strength of our pricing that was seen in the first half, it\u2019s given us some options to invest incrementally in the second half to further strengthen our brand portfolio.","I mean that's what has happened and will be happening as we go through the second half of the year.","Operator","And there're no other questions at this time. Gentlemen do you have any closing remarks.","Mark Hunter","I'd just like to thank everybody for the time for joining us on the Molson Coors Q2 earnings call and as I mentioned earlier hopefully we'll see many of you at the Barclays Global Consumer Staples Conference in Boston, on September the 10th. So thank you for your time and interest in our company and look forward to catching up with you in due course. Thanks everybody.","Operator","Thank you again for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions].","Before we begin, I will paraphrase the Company's Safe Harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the Company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections.

","Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the Company discusses are versus the comparable prior-year prior and in U.S. dollars. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors. ","Mark Hunter","Thank you Andrea and hello and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call and many thanks for joining us today. With me on the call this morning for Molson Coors we have Tracey Joubert, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, CEO of our U.S. Business; Fred Landtmeters, our Canada CEO; Simon Cox, the CEO of our Europe Business; Stewart Glendinning, our International CEO; Sam Walker, our Global Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; and Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller; and last but not least, Dave Dunnewald, our VP of Investor Relations. ","On the call today, Tracey and I will take you through highlights of our full-year and fourth quarter 2016 results from the Molson Coors Brewing Company along with some perspectives on 2017. Now, clearly, the biggest news for 2016 was completing our acquisition of the remaining 58% of MillerCoors and the Miller global brand portfolio for $12 billion, representing the largest transaction in our Company's history which made Molson Coors the third largest global brewer. ","We also retain the rights to all of the brand that were in the MillerCoors portfolio in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including REDD's and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell. The transaction was completed at 9.2 times effective purchase multiple, including the present value of cash tax benefits. ","Additionally, we will be driving substantial cost synergies in the next three years and we continue to expect this transaction to be significantly accretive to underlying earnings in the first full year of operations. With the completion of the transaction and the changes we're making to align and enhance our organization, the building blocks are in place for our Company to drive top-line growth, profit, cash generation, debt pay-down and total shareholder returns in the years ahead. ","Led by our First Choice for consumer and customer agenda, these building blocks are grouped into four key areas. First, our organization and France are all under one roof for the first time. We've also reset our performance incentives around growth in sales, specifically volume and revenue per hectoliter, profit, cash and profit after capital charge or PACC, to help ensure top to bottom alignment with our key priorities and of course, those of our investors, including driving total shareholder return and performance towards our committed deleverage targets. ","Secondly, our consumer excellence approach. Our global brand portfolio of Coors, Miller and Staropramen, supported by our national champion, craft and speciality brands, now gives a platform for accelerating performance outside of our core developed markets over time. Within our largest markets, we now have more opportunities to lift and shift our highest potential brands, creative platforms, commercial ideas and innovations to drive growth and value. ","We remain absolutely focused on driving improvements in our core brand performance in the U.S. and Canada in particular. Outside of North America, Coors Light continues to grow volume at double-digit rates through 2016 and our largest brand was almost flat globally. Our Europe business increased retail volume and market share in the past year and our international business drove strong volume growth in high potential markets in Latin America and Asia Pacific. ","Thirdly, our customer excellence approach. We're investing heavily in sales capability and execution improvement, including a suite of leading-edge sales technology and tools, supported by our new global commercial team with First Choice Learning Center, we've rolled this approach across all of our markets and are excited about the promise of this effort to drive incremental revenue, margin and profit. ","The key metric we used to evaluate our customer engagement is a net promoter score or NPS and we're already making great strides in improving our NPS performance across all of our markets. In fact, for the first time in its history, MillerCoors finished number one in the most recent Tamarron Supplier Survey which pulls hundreds of U.S. distributors in rating the performance of beer, wine and spirits suppliers. We're building stronger partnerships by providing beer expertise, customer centric solutions and industry-leading service and results. ","Progress is also reflected in other customer awards our teams have recently won, including the number one supplier ranking in the UK's advantage chain retail survey, Supplier of the Year across all categories by Tesco, the biggest retailer in the UK and the Supplier of the Year award from Boston Pizza, the largest on-premise chain in Canada. As one organization, we're lifting and shifting the best disciplines and customer solutions across markets, including bringing our U.S. Building with Beer tool to Canada and other markets this year. ","And lastly, our focus on talent development, diversity and inclusion is really laser-focused in enabling our First Choice agenda and leadership capability right across our enterprise. With these building blocks in place, we believe that Molson Coors is positioned to grow total shareholder returns. The completion of the MillerCoors transaction represents a step forward in the size and strength of our business and this will drive some significant changes in our financial numbers in the near term as we align and enhance our financial reporting. ","In order to provide more comparable financial information, unless otherwise indicated, all fourth quarter and full-year 2016 consolidated and U.S. results discussed on this call will be presented in a pro forma basis as if the MillerCoors transaction and its financing had been completed at the beginning of 2015. So, start with business highlights for 2016. ","Overall, we're pleased with the progress our Company made last year. We increased global pro forma net sales per hectoliter 1.4% in constant currency for the year as we continued to achieve positive net pricing and to premiumize our portfolio towards higher margin, higher growth above premium brands. We exceeded our target for cost savings and we expanded pro forma underlying gross and pretax margins globally. ","We reported nearly $2.4 billion of 2016 pro forma underlying EBITDA, an increase of 2.6% from the year before. And on an underlying pro forma basis, we grew pretax income 4.1% and after-tax income 1.9% for the year. ","Now, I'd like to share some regional highlights from 2016. In the U.S. on a pro forma basis, MillerCoors domestic net sales revenue per hectoliter grew 1.3% for the year as a result of favorable net pricing and positive sales mix. Total net sales per hectoliter, including contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, increased 1.2% for the year. ","We grew our share of the premium light segment with Coors Light completing its seventh consecutive quarter of increased segment share and it's best annual volume performance since 2012, while Miller Lite reached nine consecutive quarters of increased segment share. Coors Banquet which completed its tenth consecutive year of volume growth, gained segment share and came out of 2016 with accelerating volume trends. And above premium, we purchased three regional craft breweries during the year and began integrating these high-growth, high-potential businesses. ","Although Blue Moon seasonals and REDD's had a challenging year, Peroni continued to grow volume and Henry's Hard Soda which was launched just over a year ago, became the number one hard soda franchise in 2016. Our U.S. team is also executing new strategies to improve the performance of our economy, economy brands which are already showing signs of progress. Miller High Life had it's best annual sales to retail performance since 2009. Overall STRs, however, declined 2.5% in the U.S. in 2016. ","MillerCoors pro forma cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 2.5% driven by supply chain cost savings and lower commodity costs, partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption due to lower volumes. 2016 underlying pro forma pretax income in the U.S. was up 13.8% from the previous year as lower cost of goods sold, net pricing growth and positive sales mix were partially offset by lower volume. ","In Canada, net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 0.2%, driven by more than 1% of positive pricing and mix, partially offset by mix shift towards lower revenue packs and contract brewing volume. Our top line reflected growth in our above premier brands as Coors Banquet, Mad Jack, Belgian Moon, Creemore and our Heineken import portfolio all continued to grow volume and market share. ","Meanwhile, market pressure on the mainstream segment, particularly in Quebec and the West, drove overall STR volume 2.8% lower for the year. Canada COGS per hectoliter decreased 1.1% in local currency, driven by cost savings and lower depreciation expense. These factors were partially offset by the impacts of volume deleverage, unfavorable foreign currency movements and inflation. ","On the bottom line, 2016 Canada underlying pretax income declined 12.2% to $267.3 million, driven by lower volume, higher brand amortization, commercial investments and negative foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by cost savings and lower incentive compensation expense. We also determined that the fair value of the Molson Coor brands in Canada was lower than their carrying value, so we recorded an impairment charge of $495.2 million in the fourth quarter which is excluded from our underlying results. ","In addition, we changed these brands to definite lived intangible assets which will be amortized over 30 to 50 years. Europe net sales decreased 0.9% in local currency for the year driven by the indirect tax provision of approximately $50 million recorded in the fourth quarter related to an ongoing legal dispute along with lower contract brewing volumes. Our continued portfolio premiumization and mix management drove a 1% increase in 2016 Europe net sales revenue per hectoliter in local currency. ","On the strength of our above premium brands, including Coors Light, Sharp's, Franciscan Well, Staropramen outside of Czech Republic and Rekorderlig Cider, we grew market share in the region with a 1.4% increase in owned, licensed and royalty sales volume. COGS per hectoliter in local currency increased 4.4% due to mix shift to higher cost product and geographies, as well as lower net pension benefit. ","2016 underlying pretax income was 36.2% lower due to $86.2 million of cost increases relating to the indirect tax provision, brand amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and unfavorable foreign currency movements. ","Our international business delivered strong results in 2016 with double-digit growth in net sales in owned and royalty volume as well as improved bottom-line performance. Higher owned and royalty volume was driven by the addition of the Miller global brands along with Coors Light growth in Latin America and Australia, while net sales increased due to higher volume and positive pricing. ","This team improved 2016 financial performance significantly versus the year before and delivered on its profits commitment excluding the impact of foreign currency movements since 2013 and the total alcohol prohibition in Bihar, India from earlier in 2016. Improved financial performance was driven by the addition of the Miller brands, volume growth in Latin America and Australia, favorable mix, positive pricing, cost savings and cycling the substantial restructure of our China business in 2015. ","The integration of the Miller global brands within International, Canada and Europe is proceeding well in the first few months following the transaction close. But we're still in the early stages of assessing the historical and potential future performance of these brands. We're leveraging existing platforms and partnerships in some countries and establishing new supply chains and partnerships in other attractive new markets. ","Regardless of the structure, all of our efforts are focused on leveraging our existing scale and brand presence to grow the Coor, Staropramen and Miller trademarks and our craft brands in key markets around the globe. Now, I will turn it over to Tracey to give financial highlights and perspective on 2017. Tracey? ","Tracey Joubert","Thank you, Mark and hello, everybody. Following the completion of the MillerCoors transaction, today's results reflect a number of changes we have made to our financial reporting in order to align and clarify our results. As Mark mentioned, we're providing pro forma results for the consolidated Company and U.S. business, including updates from refinements to purchase accounting and related tax-work functions and aligning the way we report our volume. ","Current pro forma consolidated in U.S. results will be presented as if the transaction and its financing had been completed at the beginning of 2015. Canada, Europe, international and corporate results will not be presented on a pro forma basis. With that in mind, following our pro forma consolidated financial headlines for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 are as follows. ","Net sales were down 4.2% in U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter and 2.3% for the full year, primarily due to currency movements and the indirect tax provision recorded in Europe as well as lower sales volumes in North America. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 2.2% in the fourth quarter and 0.6% for the full year versus the same periods last year. ","Our net sales per hectoliter in the constant currency decreased 0.8% in the quarter. On a full-year basis, net sales per hectoliter increased 1.4% due to positive pricing and sales mix. On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported a pro forma net loss from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $608.1 million for the fourth quarter, down from $6.7 million of net income a year ago. ","This decrease was driven by the impairment charge recorded for the Molson brands in Canada, higher U.S. GAAP tax expense and the indirect tax provision recorded in Europe. On a full-year basis, U.S. GAAP pro forma net income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors decreased 48.9% to $257.5 million, driven by the same factors as in the quarter. ","Fourth quarter pro forma underlying after-tax income increased 16.4% to $98.7 million or $0.46 per diluted share driven by 42% higher income in the U.S. and increased performance in international, partially offset by the indirect tax provision in Europe. Full-year underlying after-tax income increased 1.9% to $936 million, driven by 13.8% higher U.S. income and lower losses in international, partially offset by lower income in Europe in Canada. ","Underlying pro forma pretax income increased 4.4% on a reported basis and increased 10.8% in constant currency for the fourth quarter. Full-year underlying pretax income increased 4.1% on a reported basis and increased 5% in constant currency. Pro forma underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $405.1 million, 4.6% higher than a year ago. For full-year 2016, our business reported $2.383 billion of pro forma underlying EBITDA, an increase of 2.6% from 2015. ","Beginning in the first quarter this year, we tend to focus our consolidated and business unit performance discussions on underlying EBITDA which will allow greater comparability with other global brewers. On our last earnings call, we told you that we would provide transaction adjusted earnings per share which is how we look at value creation from the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction. ","Since then, the SEC has provided general direction to the market, reinforcing advise against non-GAAP measures. To respect that direction, we will provide components for you to make that calculation on your own. As we mentioned previously, this metric is calculated as the sum of three numbers, underlying after-tax pro forma earnings per share, transactional related after-tax book amortization and transactional related cash tax benefits. ","In the fourth quarter, these three numbers were the underlying pro forma after-tax earnings of $98.7 million plus $9.4 million of transactional related after-tax book amortization and $63.9 million of transactional related cash tax benefits. Also, we had 216.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter on a pro forma basis. ","For the full year 2016, these numbers were the underlying pro forma after-tax earnings of $936 million plus $37.5 million of transactional related after-tax book amortization and $275 million of transactional related cash tax benefits. We had 216.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the full year on a pro forma basis. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the fourth quarter and full year. ","In the area of cost savings, we exceeded our 2016 goal by achieving more than $165 million of in-year cost reductions across our Company, driven by the U.S., Canada and Europe, with saving from MillerCoors exceeding $85 million on a pro forma basis, along with more than $80 million from outside the U.S.. These results benefited from significant non-synergy cost savings initiatives, such as the Eden and Alton closures which we do not expect to repeat in the near future. ","We generated $864 million for underlying free cash flow in 2016 on an actual basis, but not pro forma, up from $724 million in 2015. This growth was driven by the addition of the other 58% of MillerCoors cash flows post transaction as well as strong working capital performance including lower underlying cash tax payments versus 2015. This strong cash generation allowed us to achieve a quick start on our deleverage goals by paying down $200 million of term debt prior to the end of 2016. ","A detailed reconciliation of our 2016 and 2015 underlying free cash flow is available in our earnings release this morning. Total debt at the end of 2016 was nearly $12.1 million, while cash and cash equivalents totaled $561 million resulting in net debt of $11.5 billion. Looking forward to 2017, all of the following metrics now include 100% of MillerCoors results. ","Currently, we expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million in 2017. We anticipate 2017 pension income of approximately $24 million. Our 2017 capital spending outlook is approximately $750 million based on foreign exchange rates at the end of 2016. ","The increase in planned expenditures for 2017 is driven by the addition of MillerCoors capital expenditures, work on our new brewery in British Columbia and spending to capture transactional related synergies and other cost savings. Our consolidated net interest expense outlook for 2017 is approximately $370 million plus or minus 5%. ","We expect our 2017 underlying effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 8% assuming no further changes in tax laws, declarements of tax orders, excess tax deductions or share-based compensation or adjustments to our [indiscernible] in tax position. And this range is consistent with our current expectation for our long term tax rate. We expect our cash tax rates to be significantly lower than this range due to the cash tax benefits related to the MillerCoors transaction. ","U.S. legislative initiative to reform U.S. tax laws could have a significant impact on our tax rates and our cash tax expectations and we're following these developments closely. The post-transaction integration of our business and cost synergies capture are progressing well with the following updates, the North American supply chain is driving to create a more efficient fixable production network and we're evaluating options in light of the recent U.S. border tax proposals. ","Global procurement has 24 integration projects in flux with four already complete. Our global business services locations have been agreed in North America and Romania and we're focused on building world-class globalization of processes and digital leverage to provide sale, efficiency and effectiveness across our new business services network. In commercial, we have finalized the selection of global media partners and transferring our U.S. return on marketing investment or ROMI, model to both Canada and Europe. ","And finally, Miller global brand integration has proceeded as planned in each of our business units. We have confirmed the sale and distribution structures for two-thirds of the Miller global brand volume with a balance operating in the near term under transitional service agreement. ","For cost savings, we continue to target $550 million of all in savings which will be made up of ongoing cost savings in all of our businesses as well as transactional related synergies, all of which we plan to deliver by the third full year of our combined Company which is 2019. Related to this cost savings goal, we fully anticipate incurring approximately $350 million of one-time incremental cash costs over three years to capture synergies, about evenly split between incremental capital spending and cash operating expense, primarily in the first two years of the program. ","In the first year of this three-year program, we plan to deliver more than $175 million of all in cost savings in 2017 with most of these expected to come from non-synergy initiatives. We plan to capture the majority of our transactional related synergies in 2018 and 2019. Going forward, we will provide quarterly updates on transactional related items that we previously discussed, including our realized cash tax benefits and incremental amortization. ","We continue to expect transactional related cash tax benefits to average more than $275 million per year for the next 15 years. But we now anticipate that these benefits will be somewhat front-end loaded in the first few years, with the later years slightly lower than the $275 million average. In addition, we expect transactional related amortization of approximately $37 million annually on an after-tax basis. ","Finally, our underlying free cash flow target for 2017 is $1.1 billion plus or minus 10%. This target is consistent with the preliminary target we provided on our last earnings call and an increased impact of incremental cash paid for interest and synergy related capital in 2017 as well as the cash tax benefits resulting from the transaction. This 2017 free cash flow target excludes planned capital spending relating to building our new British Columbia, as this multi-year project is being funded largely by the sale of our former brewery in Vancouver early in 2016. ","As far as our cost outlook is concerned for the full year 2017, we expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in MillerCoors to increase at low single-digit rates and Canada COGS to increase at mid-single-digit rates in local currency. We expect our Europe COGS per hectoliter to decrease at a low-single-digit rate in local currency and our international business COGS per hectoliter to decrease at a double-digit rate. At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Mark? ","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Tracey. In 2017, we will continue to play to win via our First Choice consumer and customer agenda. In the U.S., as we move forward in 2017, we will continue to drive towards our goal of flat volume in 2018 and growth in 2019. ","We'll again invest heavily in our flagship brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite, plus Coors Banquet. Coors Light recently launched a new extension of the Climb On campaign built on our continued commitment to sustainability which we believe will resonate with a growing number of consumers who support brands and make the world a better place. ","And above premium, Henry's Hard Sparkling and new products to play in the growing alcoholic sparkling water category will be launched nationally in March with lemon lime and passion fruit flavors, while REDD's and Blue Moon Belgian White will introduce new aluminum pint packaging in the second quarter. ","Tenth and Blake, the craft and import division of MillerCoors will continue its focus in integrating and rapidly expanding the geographic reach of our craft acquisitions. As an example, the Tarrapin Beer Company will reopen its brand new taproom and micro-brewery and The Battery Atlanta, adjacent to SunTrust Park which will soon be the new home of the Atlanta Braves baseball team. In addition, Tenth and Blake will accelerate efforts on Peroni to drive incremental growth. ","Finally, we're implementing a range of new initiatives to boost our economy portfolio. Miller High Life has new marketing and redesigned packaging, the Keystone family will unveil new packaging early this year and Mickey's is bringing back its popular large format glass bottle packaging. In First Choice customer engagement, beside the Tamarron, when more than 15 retailers recently named MillerCoors their supplier of the year. ","And we increased production flexibility across our brewery network and ramped up two new aluminum pint filling lines in Fort Worth and Shenandoah to meet demand for this package. We also remain committed to developing and maintaining strong relationships with our U.S. distributors. ","In Canada, our First Choice agenda will be focused on bringing back momentum to the top line through a relentless focus on our two largest brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian in the premium segment. We look forward to a launch of the new Molson Canadian campaign celebrating Canada's 150th anniversary this year and to aligning the Coor Light creative platform with the U.S. Climb On campaign. ","We'll also drive for further growth in above premium by Coors Banquet, Mad Jack, Belgian Moon and the Heineken brand family. While MGD will be the main focus Miller brand in the short term, we're fine-tuning the potential roles of Miller Lite and Miller High Life to further strengthen our portfolio. Our customer relationships remain one of our key assets and there will be increased call efficiency in 2017 and more focus on in-store execution of our brand campaigns across all channels. ","We will also continue to transform our cost base to ensure we maximize our future competitiveness, including in our brewery network. In Europe, our First Choice consumer agenda now includes the Miller brands as well as the international license and export business in the region starting on January 1 so that we're now driving Staropramen, Coors, Carling and Miller with fully-aligned strategies across Europe. We're also continuing to build our craft portfolio, including Sharp's, Franciscan Well and further expansion of Blue Moon across the region. ","In January, we purchased a controlling interest in the Spanish craft brewery, La Sagra. Located near Madrid, La Sagra expands our craft portfolio in the world's 11th largest beer market and offers a new distribution partner in Spain for Blue Moon Belgian White. In customer excellence, our overall Europe net promoter score increased again in 2016 for the third year in a row, with 9 out of 11 countries improving their customer rating. In the UK our key accounts in convenient retail customers scored as number 1 out of 21 beverage suppliers. ","Our international business is now much bigger with the addition of the Miller global brands, including attractive developing and emerging markets. Beginning on January 1, we also changed our Puerto Rico business reporting to the international segment so that one team is now managing the entire Caribbean while at the same time transferring the European MCI markets to our Europe business. ","We're building on our existing Coors Light momentum in Latin America and leveraging opportunities to grow the Coors and Miller brands in high-opportunity market using an asset-light model by our strong partnering and local license agreements. The addition of the Miller global brands complements our growth strategy and we've already hit the ground running in key priority markets. ","In existing priority markets, such as Australia and Honduras, where our partners have already embraced Coors Light, we're ready to accelerate growth with the addition of the Miller brands. In the attractive new markets, we have begun expanding distribution with local partners, on-boarding our country managers and activating local transition service agreements. ","To summarize our discussion today, we're pleased with the overall progress our Company made in 2016. In addition to completing the MillerCoors and Miller global brands acquisition and moving quickly to integrate our business, we exceeded our targets for cash generation and cost savings and expanded pro forma gross margins and underlying pretax margins globally. We grew our above premium business globally, gained share of the key premium light segment in the U.S. and accelerated the growth in performance of our international business. ","As one Company with an expanded portfolio of iconic brands and a highly focused Leadership Team, we have the building blocks in place to leverage our increased scale, resources and combined commercial experience to accelerate our First Choice agenda and deliver long term shareholder value. Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. ","As usual, our prepared marks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 1:00 PM Eastern time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website. So at this point Andrea, we would like to open up for questions, please. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Vivien Azer","I was hoping we could drill down a little bit on the U.S. business. In particular some of the evolving dynamics that you're seeing in the competitive landscape and specifically at economy price points. Can you talk a little bit about some of the discount names that we're really seeing in the us and what you think these are rational choices that are being made in the subsegment? Thanks. ","Mark Hunter","Thanks for that question, Vivien I will ask Gavin to give some color. I think the context before we get into that detail is just look at our NSR per hectoliter performance in the U.S. which actually 2016 versus 2015 was relatively solid which is I think a good place to start the conversation. Gavin, do you want to just talk a little bit about the progress we're making on the economy and what pricing environment looks like? ","Gavin Hattersley","Sure good morning, Vivien. Look, I mean I just reiterate what Mark said right as our fourth quarter net pricing grows was only slightly than the growth we achieved for the full-year and for the full-year of 2016 growth of 1% is actually higher than we realized in 2015 so we're not really seen a deceleration of pricing. As it relates specifically to our economy portfolio and the economy beer segment is binge drinking relative to economy wines and spirits. Obviously we engaging the economy beer drinker is really important. Our strategy and economy is actually designed to bring more value to our drinkers across our brands. That's not a price focus strategy.","The economy represents a significant volume for us it represents a significant volume opportunity for us and it's important that we get drinkers into the economy portfolio rather than getting to cheap wines and spirits because once they are in their that is where they tend to stay they grow loyalty to beer. As far as the progress we're making is concerned Miller High Life has moved away from the more hipster I am rich campaign we're now focusing on if you've got the time we've got the beer campaign and the brand had its best quarterly annual performance in seven years. In fact in the public Nielsen data that we actually grew share and grew volume in early February of this year.","We're offering better value at retail to our customers with Keystone light 15 packs this is the 12 pack, Milwaukee's Best introduced a new packaging and looking were taken the alcohol up a Milwaukee's Best on regular and on ice. We've taken alcohol content on ice house up and Hamm's which has been around since 1865 has begun to reposition itself in certain geographies at opening price points. I'm pleased with the progress that we've made on our strategy for economy and it's really important for us as a business that we keep our drinkers in beer as opposed to wine and spirits. ","Vivien Azer","Can I squeeze in one more? ","Mark Hunter","Sure. Why not, Vivien?","Vivien Azer","Thanks, guys. So if we're looking at the price mix realization or the net revenue per hectoliter that you saw in the fourth quarter you guys have announced there's going to be a change in terms of the funding split between you and your distributors. What would that have look like if that changed had gone into effect in the beginning of the fourth quarter just so we understand the relative benefits of making that change? ","Gavin Hattersley ","We're changing domestic industry standard 50\/50 on all package beer and we worked very hard to ensure that the model is consistent keeping both MillerCoors and our distributors net revenue neutral point in time. It's all about executing our pricing strategy versus someone else's. The change will ensure that we can equally share in investments and benefits from a joint customer point of view we're ultimately make better choices together but it's revenue neutral. So you will see changes in our finance reporting on the sales revenue. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Powers of UBS. Please go ahead.","Stephen Powers","Actually two things if I could. One is just a quick clarification. I may have missed it but did you realize any savings against your three-year plan in fourth quarter that just concluded? That would be the first question and just kind of building of Vivien's question on the economy as you ramp up the economy focus how certainly a repercussions have you taken that you can draw attention from economy wine and spirits are competitor beer brands and not cannibalize from elsewhere in your portfolio? ","Mark Hunter","To start on the first question, just to be clear I mean the $550 million of savings and ounce for the next three years start from the beginning of 2017 and we have given you the specific cost savings that we've achieved through 2016 was that what was actually right at the top end of our expectation, principally driven by the fact that we had the Eden and often closures in 2016 of those were significant nonrecurring event. So as you think about comparables, I would push them to one side because as I said they are nonrecurring events but the $559 is still solid the next two years and obviously as I said we will update that progress against that on a regular basis and update more fully on an annual basis.","On your question on the economy brands to be fair I think, Gavin really colored most of what we're doing there. We're ensuring that our portfolio is fit for purpose, operational consumer value and makes our economy brands attractive relative to the choices that are available in economy spirits and economy wines so we believe that we're strengthening our relationships with drinkers bringing drinkers back into our brands by offering value across the portfolio. A measure there's really anything else to add to that. ","Tracey Joubert","The thing I would add to a, market is that we haven't seen impact on our premium brands effect we actually increase share meaningfully in the fourth quarter and December was actually one of our best year months in a very long time. In economy strategy went to back into the year. In fact we grew segment share with Miller Lite and Coors Light for 20 consecutive months. I haven't seen that impact that Stephen refers to and is certainly not a strategy. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Laurent Grandet","Actually ever go on the other side of the beer segment somewhere the premium one. You have been saying that you transferred the Blue Moon brand from tense and Blake to your core business can you tell us I mean where you stand on that transfer and how it is working? And also all the different initiatives you do to drive that revenue back to hectoliter. ","Mark Hunter","Gavin you want to pick up on Blue Moon and I think it's important to talk Blue Moon Belgian white obviously the seasonal part of that business and industries? Have been under a lot of pressure do you want to update? ","Gavin Hattersley","Sure, thanks. We originally conceived Blake in 2010 to crippled and expand crap rents like blooming in Leinenkugel's and some of the iconic bronze with like Perrone and since that time Bloomington Leinenkugel's have grown from regional powerhouses into really national mainstay so holding their own through this explosion of choice and different styles and given the scale and size of these two brands and made absolute sense for us to move it into the marketing department or each of the marketing departments and the move has gone particularly well.","Mark referred to the seasonals and variety packs and yes Bluemoon has lost volume on seasonals and variety packs that this is industry wide and Bluemoon is no different to anybody else. Blue Moon Belgian white we've made some tweaks to our above the line and we're seeing the early benefits of that with meaningful trend improvements in the fourth quarter and into 2017 so I guess the short answer is the transfer has gone well. ","Mark Hunter","Laurent, I think your question just talked about how we're driving our and as our per hack right across our business the focus in all geographies is really about how we premium eyes our portfolio and if you look at our results across Canada, Europe and more broadly our international business we're only playing in the above premium segment is a return orientate the Business thought the same time recognizing economic engine is still our mainstream brand it's the power we've got to keep our big mainstream brands performing well and we talk share improvements particularly our biggest market, the us what the same time premium is in our portfolio and that is what we're about and that is what we will continue to focus on. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Judy Hong","I wanted to follow up with a few questions on the cost savings. Given that 2016 actually came in at the high end of your range, can you talk about the potential upside to your $175 million target 2017 as part of your three-year cost savings target and it seems like we're actually looking for a step down versus 2016 so just wanted to get a little bit more clarity around that. And then can you tell us in terms of split of Miller's curve versus other segment with that $175 million target and Tracy I think you talked about potentially looking at supply-chain opportunities and evaluating it in light of the potential border just ability as part of the corporate tax reform so if you could talk about the implication of the total number that you set out? ","Mark Hunter","Judy, that's cheating there was about 18 questions and not one. ","Judy Hong","Cost savings. ","Mark Hunter","I think that was kind of three groups there so on the first one in relation to 2017 versus 2016 I think I covered that earlier 2016 a which we're very pleased about was kind of inflated versus what you call the normal normalized number because of the closure of Eden and Alton brewery, as though there are nonrecurring but very significant events to make a looking at 2016 and 2017 will start to strip out that impact. The $175 million number that we guided for trend for 2017 is in a that we feel confident that we will be focused on delivering and as we always intended to do we set our sales a target we try to meet him period that is what will attempt to do you through 2017. And that will be solid progress against our longer term $550 million of savings. With regard to the North American supply-chain, to and you want to just talk to how we're thinking about the? ","Tracey Joubert","So we have plans in place. We're making costs possible because it's very difficult very early to predict andcomment on any kind of changes that will come from tax reform that the administration is looking at. We have plans, we plan on if something changes we will make sure that they we can change direction. ","Judy Hong","Tracey if I could just follow up so the last earnings call there was some confusion around the free cash flow guidance and obviously came up with $1.1 billion that's in line with what you given us but any kind of color you can give us in terms of what you think you one-off or one-time items within that $1.1 billion number would be for 2017 that would be appreciated? ","Tracey Joubert","The guidance has remained consistent with what we told you is $1.11 billion plus or minus 10%. We don't break out that affects our free cash flow but some of the factors that probably you should consider is we've spoken about the incremental CapEx is going to be required to capture synergies and other cost savings and most of that will come in 2017 and 2018. If you recall we did tell you that the total cash cost was around $350 million to deliver the synergies and cost savings, that's when to be split evenly between CapEx and OpEx over the next three years. The other item to consider around free cash flow is we've got the incremental cash interest as a result of acquisition date sell that's a step up on that line. And then other items that affect us would be things like pension contribution, timing of working capital changes and then cash taxes on incremental income from the U.S. which is now a higher proportion of our income so that will also affect the free cash flow. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel. Please go ahead. ","Mark Swartzberg","Hey, Mark. Continuing one of the topics that to the race, Tracey the comments made about the related synergies is that the majority will be realized in 2018 and 2019. So, the obvious question is what you mean by majority? I doubt you will tell us the difference between 50% and 99% but as you think about moving past these next three years and the due diligence he will be doing on opportunities is it fair to think very up this morning areas for incremental savings is a procurement is a commercial is a commercial of just trying to get a sense of where the additional savings might come from over the next few years. ","Mark Hunter","Let me offer a couple of comments there, Mark we're going to get into splitting out the detail of the $550 million. We have said that the synergies related element which if you remember we did talk about in our last call which has come in as a bigger number and a faster number so faster realization which is good news, it's principally weighted into years 2018 and 2019, 2017 is more of a transition year as the businesses together we can all of the work streams up and running to moving any volume around the network requires significant planning and CapEx investment I forgot about phasing we've got in the fact those $550 million of savings will be in the year by the end of 2019.","I don't want to give any further detail be on the. I think is our businesses come together in the markets, our ability to flex production across geographies but also how we can generate additional revenue synergies as we transfer some of our commercial excellence capabilities around our business which is so central to my approach something I think will unlock real value for us actually improving are overall commercial performance, First Choice agenda and the thing and shifting as practice ideas whether that's pricing and revenue Management plugging portfolio gaps and getting behind brands that we've launched that are working well and one geography, moving them to other geographies. All of that is ahead of us and for me opportunity and exciting but more of that to come I think into course. ","Mark Swartzberg","That's very helpful. And to build on that, Mark, commercial and customer excellence sure is contributing to this upgrade your seen among distributor in the U.S. and the way they are ready versus other suppliers. Is also translating it seems into and Gavin you pointed this out, to improve sure per transfer premium life but your overall share trends are quite unfolding the way you would like. Can you talk a little bit about what in that customer excellence focus is to come so to speak that can translate into either a pickup in the pace of sure taking and premium life or an improvement in the performance of other aspects of your portfolio. ","Gavin Hattersley","I actually think that we're very pleased with our sure performance, Mark, 22 straight months of performance highest we've had in many years and the month of December. But if you peel back the various brands, Mark, Coors Light four proceeding quarters we've had the best run since 2012. We've upgraded the regional identity on Coors Light and we're going to be building on the time on campaign to sustainability efforts as we head into summer. Miller Lite has had very positive volume growth in three of the last nine quarters which represents the best performance that we had from the brand.","It goes back to the change in the original packaging in 2014 and then it is very different campaign. 'S we're pleased with the platform for which we could for Miller Lite and 2016. Coors Banquets achieved its tenth consecutive year of growth in 2016 with the front have performance in the low single digits and accelerating in the second half of the year than to mid-single-digit growth and we're going to be building a campaign as we go forward. We're introducing Spanish-language TV to go after the Latino segment of beer drinkers. I think are really covered our economy strategy and our economy portfolio strategy early enough, Mark I'm not going to repeat all that. ","Mark Hunter","So Gavin the only thing I would add in and Mark just for information is we wanted the decisions I've made is to take a portion of our synergies and reinvest our back into our business into our global growth team our commercial excellence team in the focused around a handful of areas so we're investing more pretty fundamental segmentation analysis which will inform an awful lot of our portfolio decision-making going forward and that's been done consistently across our business unit.","We got a stronger broader global innovation team in place to drive for more disruptive innovation. We've now got a new, global digital team in place is for each of our business units with best practice. We've got small global brands team in place and a global customer excellence team focused on things like our MPS performance, field sales Management, pricing and revenue Management so for us to get different outputs going forward, we're making some changes in our business from an input perspective which I think will stand as in good stead as I look out over the course of the next 35 years and really building the commercial muscle of our organization over 18,000 people now lined up behind our First Choice agenda and I'm convinced that will pay dividends to our business as we move into the future. ","Mark Swartzberg","And if I can make one last one on the global dimension, Mark, of course the international Miller business is now yours. Can either you or Tracy can you give us some sense of the dollar amount we're talking about in terms of the cost of owning that either in year one? And the slope so to speak on that number? Because you need to layer and costs, you addressed it in your prepared remarks but I don't have a good sense of the dollar value. We put something in our model that can you give us some sense of the year one increment there and then with the slope on that number might be over the next few years? ","Tracey Joubert","I thought you might ask that question, the short answer is no at this stage, Mark. We are on our pro forma, we've excluded the Miller international brands and we're still working through the fine detail of the trailing EBITDA number. And then the aspirations moving forward. Is complex because it wasn't a definitive kind of business unit within SAB and it was spread across all of their operating units.","Mark Swartzberg","Do you want to just give a little bit of color though on what you are seeing in some of the markets and how you're looking at that business? ","Mark Hunter","Look, Mark I think to Mark's point more detail to come later but I think broadly we've had a very good start. We transition many of the markets of the PSA's. River excited about the prospect for the brand. As you might imagine of course there are some markets that are performing better than we expected, some markets that are performing as well but broadly speaking these are strong, growing markets that are now open the door for our other brands, have brought send scale to bear in existing markets where we're already selling course products and I think about a very strong opportunity going forward. ","Tracey Joubert","And Mark the only thing I would add is, continue very much focused around are asset light approach, working on Partnership's and a license and export basis that has served as well and I think from a relative cash use framework that we have articulated pretty consistently I think is the right approach for our business. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Holland of Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","Andrew Holland","A couple questions if I may. Firstly, you refer in your remarks about Europe to the ongoing legal dispute and you put a $50 million indirect tax provision in the quarter. Can you just remind us what is going on there, what's behind that and what this sort of outcome is and whether there is any danger of needing any further provisions in 2017? And a slightly more detailed one can you just give us an idea of what your UK volumes have done in the year? And then perhaps thirdly could you just give us an idea of your trading year-to-date in the New Year? ","Tracey Joubert","Sure, so kind of in reverse order we don't give a trading update and that's a change that we made last year Andrew so the biggest slice of our business now is are U.S. business and the scanner detail is in the public domain so I would just refer you to that or any other data and any other markets we don't give short term trading updates. With regards to our UK binds someone as Simon just talk about in a second he can set that in the context of how our European business is performing and to your first question around the provision that we took, that's an ongoing legal dispute so we can't really get into any further details.","Our review is that's the best estimate of the potential requirement on a multiyear basis. There is further detail in our 10-K which gives you a sense which gives you little bit more color. And really refer you to look at that but $50 million provision is really four year perspective so that gives you a sense of let's call it and your requirements because it's an ongoing legal dispute I can get into any more detail than that. I think to your second question, Simon to just want to talk about the UK and more broadly are European performance? ","Andrew Holland","Yes.","Tracey Joubert","Thank you Andrew. It's been a strong quarter four both the UK and European business. So you asked specifically about the UK. We continue to do well on premium citation we've had strong performance from Coors Light, continued good performance from our craft brands in the UK and Franciscan well and repatriation of our UK business also going very well. Along with our new entry through the quarterly brand supporting that together along with our very strong performance in the eyes of our customers where we have not been for sure is a number of channels in a number of customers, our UK business is in very good shape.","If I put the UK business in context the European business is probably helpful to note or more helpful to you guys actually to get our European business performance, taking aside the indirect tax provision which by the way has been an issue spanning just over four years. So if I took that to one side of the a full-year issue weighing on every single quarter it gives you a very distorted picture.","If I give you the underlying fundamentals of the European business, there pretty strong. In quarter 4 we grew our volumes by 2.5% and we gained share at our Q4 share was accelerated share gain versus the rest of the year. In combination with that we grew our net sale revenue by 3.1% and if I take the tax provision to one side and give your number and constant currency, our underlying pretax profits grew by over 20%. So we would be very successful by the UK performance driven by immunization First Choice for customers in the overall European performance through Q4 and that pretty much reflects the year that we've had in Europe as well. ","Andrew Holland","Okay just sorry just to clarify for the year or as a whole, I think your volumes, if I can make head or tails of the tables were down in Europe and for the year just marginally. And I'm just interested to know whether that was because of Continental Europe or the UK or both? ","Tracey Joubert","Our own brand volumes Andrew, our own brand and royalty volumes are up 1.4% so the slight decline you see is really driven by contract manufacturing. And I would point to in terms of underlying business underlying business 1.4% growth we would regard the along with our pricing and our next performance for the full-year to be good performance we've taken share we've grown up, we've grown our revenue and we've managed to grow that sells revenue per hectoliter across the or 0.4% so I think the suite of those metrics we be very pleased with. ","Dave Dunnewald","So just to help you with navigating to the financials at the top of the summary of operations for example the year business those volume numbers of what we call financial volume and they include not only some brand volumes and things that flow through the P&L but also contract period and also factored brand line which is part of our new volume policy for this year. What Simon was talking about to find call it brand volumes owned and royalty and so forth in the narrative of the release and the prepared remarks for the call. ","Operator,","Our next question comes from Robert Bronstein of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Robert Bronstein","A couple of questions thank you a couple questions on the U.S. business. First just in terms of Q4 and implications on Q1 can you talk a little about the fairly significant difference between the best years the STWs in the U.S. and Q4? As well as any impact from calendar issues and the weather on the market and are performance? ","Gavin Hattersley",",","One change we made this year is we kept arbors up and all the way through the end of the year which is different from what we've done in the past we want to make sure that we cover dollar distributors orders we did that we did fulfill all the orders we received. We didn't push any inventory into our distribution network. We did have somewhat higher inventories as a result of the overall industry reduction in December. Our share was actually as good as it's been for a while but the overall industry as you know right across the alcohol and package goods was down in December so that drove our inventories up a little bit.","The higher inventory level we had, Robert, certainly helped us with our service in the first month of the year. And we reduced our stocks and improved service quite meaningfully compared to previous years in the January. From a whether point of view the only real weather impacts we've had at the end of the year were some freezing conditions in both Milwaukee and Colorado which led to some challenges with Bluemoon and Bluemoon inventory but other than that no. As far as 2016 is concerned [indiscernible] inventory levels at the end of the year but our current plan is to ship to consumption in the year. ","Robert Bronstein","So if it wasn't weather related what happened in the industry in December than? ","Mark Hunter","Robert, I'll leave it up to you. Despite the fact that we were down in volume I was very pleased with our share performance particularly in the premium light segment and as I said we saw particularly good performance coming out of only parts of our economy strategy with dollar highlife and I'll be repeating myself if I go into all that again. ","Gavin Hattersley","Robert if you look more broadly across alcohol in CPG their just seem to be a general sluggishness in terms of demand I think we're wrestling to pinpoint why particularly at a time where there was so much frothing as an exuberance on the stock market so it remains a little bit of a mystery but it was I think a broad CPG kind of weakness through the month of December and is difficult to say it was due to X or Y. ","Robert Bronstein","And Gavin a bigger picture question on U.S. beer. One of the striking things that we saw in 2016 was a fairly significant slowdown in the craft sector and lots of reasons for that for some changes at least what we're hearing in terms of retailers in terms of their sets may be knocking out some long tail of some of the smaller crafts. So could you kind of give your assessment big picture in terms of what's going on in the beer market in the U.S. with the American consumer, what's happening with craft and retailers and how you're positioning yourself to take advantage of that? ","Mark Hunter","Robert, it's Mark here. Let me pick up because this could be a long conversation that may come back to I think some of the comments we made to last year. I think the prognosis is that craft has been great from a beer industry evolution perspective it's brought more drinkers any more conversations about sales and provenance and that's good for beer and its long term health and sustainability. It would appear to be the case that we're probably in a bit of an oversupply situation and many of the craft brands which are very across styles which are very occasions specific, mean that there is probably a limitation as to how brought that craft footprint can become. ","Many retailers I think are now recognizing that they have got inefficiencies on their shelf sets and too many SKUs which are too specialized and certainly the more sophisticated retailers as would come through 2016 have been asking us for support and building with their approach to Gavin and team have in our category Partnership's actually help many we tellers shift sell shots and drive efficiency and velocity appoint a purchaser think you will see that continue to 2017 and beyond and the people that one that will be the big national craft brands of corporal clarity of positioning and distinctiveness of brands like our will place.","Regional brands have got meaning across both the states and you'll continue to see a lot of local term and very small very local label profiles et cetera in many retailers will continue to give that visibility and presence but overall there should be a simple vacation of the offer from a sharper perspective. Gavin I don't know if I missed anything in that in a brief summary? ","Robert Bronstein","Coming into 2017 to believe you will have more equal or less shelf space and display space at your major retailers? ","Mark Hunter","Robert some of the big retailers have modified their assortment strategies just address out of stocks and to improve inventory turn. We believe that's the inevitable evolution as Mark said the number of SKUs that been added to the beer category over the past two years so overall we actually agree with that. And in some areas I would say that it has improved our positioning and in some areas it hasn't I think it's coming into 2017 we'll us is that. In its totality. But it's a strategy that we agree with because focus to core packages and provides a healthy balance between out of stocks and variety. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Bryan Spillane","I've got a couple of small picture questions I guess. One is on the tax provision. I think you covered this in response to a previous question. The $50 million provision that you took in Europe, the Europe segment it's sort of a one-time cost. You're making an accrual, based on what your best estimate of the exposure would be so as were sort of modeling next year, we wouldn't come to me that you've got, that there would be the estimate correct, we wouldn't and that $50 million to next year. Is that right? ","Tracey Joubert","That is our current best estimate of what is called the exposure and it's an aggregated four year timeline. There's a little bit more detail in the 10-K, Brian but I think that's a fair assessment. Where we're at this point time. ","Bryan Spillane","So given that is not a period cost specific to the fourth quarter, it knocked about $0.18 or $0.20 of the quarter? ","Tracey Joubert","Yes. That's factually correct. ","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then second question, just related to the write-down in Canada, is are going to be incremental amortization expense that we have to start plugging into Canada each year now based on the way you're going to amortize the brand there? ","Tracey Joubert","Yes. So that's correct, Bryan. Having moved the brands amortizing them over 30 to 50 years will give us a full-year cost of about $40 million on the full-year. Obviously that's a non-cash cost so it doesn't affect our cash flow number, but it will flow through on our earnings line. So that's correct and pretty standard in these situations. ","Dave Dunnewald","And just so people know this is Dave Dunnewald, that started in the fourth quarter so you'll see three quarters of that impact kind of on an overlap basis in 2017. ","Tracey Joubert","So about $30,000,000.2017, $40 million on a full-year basis. ","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then the last one, I noticed on your website if got the pro forma updates through the fourth quarter. So I'm assuming is that what we should be using out to sort of adjuster models, the base for our models to model of 2017? ","Tracey Joubert","Yes. That's correct. We tried -- a few people have talked about quarter we tried very hard to make this really clear and consistent. Using the pro forma I think it's everybody can have the best view of our business on a like for like basis. Think one thing just to mention is one of the made from the previous set of pro forma's related to really more detail planning on the PP are depreciation number is actually increased so that given us about $0.07 in the fourth quarter. So just as you look at the previous set of performance the new set of performance one of the numbers you may not have spotted is the depreciation number is bigger because the more exacting analysis of how we're allocating some of the asset values and life's and our business in the fourth quarter this out $0.07 difference to probably what you were expecting. ","Bryan Spillane","And it looks like it's also there some adjustments to the prior quarter also from what I saw on that line? ","Tracey Joubert","Yes. That's correct so we flowed that all the way back see if got full-year 20, full-year 2016 but there was a chunk in the fourth quarter in 2016 so just look out for that as you do your analysis and then just one last one I guess is we're talking about the pro forma.","Bryan Spillane","Is there anything else that's different today versus that November 1 set of pro formas besides the depreciation? ","Tracey Joubert ","Yes so Bryan there was another driver and that related to a pension amortization. So once we sort of got down through the interpretation of our performer guidance we actually removed a pro forma adjustment that we had in that pro forma back in November. And it also related to purchase accounting impacts so the tailwind going into 2017 for that reference around $30 million. And just another item is that the Miller global brands are not in the pro forma. ","Bryan Spillane","All right. So as we're looking at bridging from pro forma to next year there's that $30 million that shouldn't repeat next year and then whatever we were thinking about in terms of the Miller global brands? ","Tracey Joubert","That's right. ","Mark Hunter","Plus the full-year amortization related to the Canada impairment, that's correct. ","Bryan Spillane","And obviously the $50 million pension is the other one that hopefully won't recur? ","Mark Hunter","Provision, yes. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Pablo Zuanic of SIG. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually [indiscernible] on for Pablo. Two quick questions. One I think you made of touched on already. The new $550 million worth of cost savings energy guidance how much cannot be attributed to MillerCoors itself, for a man dollars a century? And then secondly the pro forma EBIT ex-items was up for a $27 million trend for 2016 for disclosure. How much of that could be attributed to the deal? ","Mark Hunter","Sorry the line is a little bit tricky can you just repeat the second part? ","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. The pro forma EBIT for MillerCoors was up $170 million term for 2016 can you just tell us how much of that can be attributed to the deal? ","Mark Hunter","All right let me take the two questions one at a time. Tracy you want to take the second question, on the first question that is three-year guidance and acronym in a split in about by business unit we're reporting on an enterprise-level and we'll update on an ongoing basis. We have set a target of $175 million as we go through 2017 and as I said earlier we try and meet or beat those numbers as we always anticipate that we're not breaking out cost savings by business unit. On the second question which relates to the 2016 performance I think Dave Dunnewald. ","Dave Dunnewald","Let me pick up that one. It sounds as are you looking essentially for an earnings accretion or what was the deal that affect. You will see that pro forma number we've done anything we can to make those as comparable as possible for the adjustments in 2015 and 2016 are substantially the same. You want to see the deal benefit either just looking at the more actual results to be posted for the fourth quarter and comparing that with the archers as we've had in our prior year quarter. That's going to do your best estimate at this point but we're going to actually do call it full math around the that will give you a general idea and you can see that on the EBITDA tables in the earnings release and the other let's call it pretax earnings tables look at the actual number. ","Operator","There are no further questions in the Q4 so this concludes our question-and-answer session and I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Mark Hunter for closing remarks. ","Mark Hunter","Angela, that sounded almost like we choreographed that there. So many thanks for joining our call this morning and for your continued interest in the Molson Coors Brewing Company. We look forward to seeing you at forthcoming events and on our next call at the end of our Q1 earnings as well. Thanks, everybody. ","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Peter Swinburn, President and CEO of Molson Coors.","Peter S. Swinburn","Thank you, Jonah. Hello. Welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call and thank you for joining us today. With me on the call this morning are Gavin Hattersley, Molson Coors' CFO; Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors; Stewart Glendinning, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors Europe; Kandy Anand, CEO of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors' Chief Legal and People Officer; Brian Tabolt, Molson Coors' Controller; Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors' VP of Investor Relations, and I'm delighted to say that our Chairman, Pete Coors, has -- is also joining us today. On the call today, Gavin and I will take you through highlights of our third quarter 2014 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective in the final quarter of 2014.","In the third quarter, our underlying after tax income decreased 2.7% and underlying EBITDA declined 2.5%. While we continue to expand gross margins and generate substantial cash, the underlying results were impacted by negative foreign currency movements, increased marketing spending and the loss of the Modelo business in Canada, partially offset by the release of a reserve following the favorable resolution of a regulatory matter in Europe, all of which accounted for a combined $22 million negative pretax impact to the quarter.","Despite these headwinds, we continued to strengthen our brand portfolio, deliver value-added innovation, grow our share of above premium, implement common processes and focus on profit after capital charge as the key driver of our cash and capital allocation strategy. However, on a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported a pretax loss due to a $360 million impairment of the Jelen and O\u017eujsko, 2 of our brands in Europe. The largest markets for these brands are Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia, where 2 primary factors drove the impairments: first, weak consumer demand, which we expect to be exacerbated by the long-term impact of the severe flooding in May; and second, the growth of the low-price value segment.","In the third quarter, Coors Light global volume, including our proportional percentage of MillerCoors volumes, decreased approximately 1% versus a year ago due to underperformance in Canada and the U.S., and we are implementing plans to reverse the trends in these markets. Meanwhile, Coors Light grew more than 15% in the United Kingdom and much faster in Latin America, and Coors Banquet grew share in both U.S. and Canada.","Volume for Carling, the #1 brand in the United Kingdom, declined in the quarter, as we cycled unusually warm weather a year ago and felt the after-effects of some aggressive World Cup competitive pricing noted in the second quarter. Our Carling and the overall share trends in the United Kingdom improved in the second quarter to the third quarter. And we still expect to see overall share growth in the second half of the year.","Our Europe above-premium portfolio continued to grow strongly, led by Coors Light and Doom Bar. Staropramen volume in Central Europe, outside of the Czech Republic, also continued its growth trajectory, and additionally, the brand achieved strong growth in the international markets of Germany and the United Kingdom.","In the U.S., pretax earnings increased nearly 3% in the quarter, driven by positive pricing, sales mix and cost savings. The U.S. business has not recovered as quickly as we had hoped, but we were able to grow our above-premium brands. Premium and Premium Light beers continue to underperform the overall market, but Miller Lite held share of its segment on the strength of its Original Lite package redesign, which now extends to Canada's bottles, aluminum pints and secondary packaging.","In Canada, our termination of the distribution rights to the Modelo brands early this year drove more than 2\/3 of the decrease in constant currency earnings in the third quarter. During the quarter, we've also resolved our dispute with SABMiller regarding the Miller brands in Canada. As a consequence, we will no longer distribute these brands after March next year. In above premium, Coors Banquet delivered strong volume and share growth, as did our Creemore craft brand. The combined Coors Light and Banquet brand family grew market share from a year ago. Canada financial results also benefited from substantial cost savings, higher net pricing and positive mix versus a year ago.","Our Europe business grew earnings, despite the ongoing negative impacts of the floods in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia earlier in the year. Industry volume was down 6%, with the floods occurring in some of our highest share Europe markets, therefore, just proportionately affecting our business. Nonetheless, our overall share declined only slightly in the quarter, and we grew share in Croatia, Romania and Hungary. On a year-to-date basis, our Europe business has held share, despite the impact of the floods.","Our International business continued improving its top line performance by growing volume and net sales of double-digit rates in the quarter. Coors Light continued to grow at strong double-digit rates in Latin America, and volume more than doubled in India.","Now I'll turn it over to Gavin to give third quarter financial highlights and a perspective on the fourth quarter. Gavin?","Gavin D. Hattersley","Thank you, Peter, and hello, everybody. Molson Coors' third quarter underlying after tax earnings decreased 2.7% to $271.5 million or $1.46 per share, driven by lower volume, a double-digit increase in brand investments, unfavorable foreign currency movements and a higher underlying effective tax rate. Our underlying pretax income in constant currency increased 0.7% due to improved financial performance in the U.S. and Europe as well as lower underlying corporate interests.","Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors decreased 3.4% due to lower volume in the U.S., Canada and Europe, partially offset by double-digit growth in international. On a U.S. GAAP basis, we posted a $35.7 million net loss from continuing operations, attributable to MCBC due to special charges related to the impairment of intangible brand assets in Europe. Special and other noncore items are described in detail in this morning's earnings release.","Now I'll provide an overview of our results, with MillerCoors presented as if it were proportionally consolidated. This is a non-GAAP approach, but we believe it provides a useful view of some key performance metrics for our business. On this basis, total company net sales increased 0.2% from the prior year, driven by positive pricing and mix, which were largely offset by lower volume. On a per hectoliter basis, net sales increased 2.7% due to higher pricing and mix in the United States and Canada as well as positive geographic mix in Europe.","Underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 2.6% due to higher costs in Europe and the U.S., largely due to mix impacts, partially offset by lower costs in Canada due to foreign currency and international due to mix. Total company underlying gross margin was unchanged at 41.6%, as U.S. and Canada margins improved and Europe and international gross margins declined from a year ago. Underlying marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 0.9%, driven by Canada, international and the U.S., partially offset by Europe. Underlying operating margin was 18.1%, 10 basis points lower than a year ago, due to lower operating margins in Canada and international. Our underlying EBITDA was $469.2 million in the third quarter, 2.5% lower than a year ago, driven by the lower earnings in Canada and higher foreign currency losses in corporate. Year-to-date underlying EBITDA of $1.2 billion represents an increase of 4.2% versus a year ago. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.","As I have mentioned on previous calls, we have discontinued sales curve accounting for our marketing and sales expense, beginning in 2014. This change has no effect on the total amount of annual marketing and sales spending reported, but it does affect the quarterly timing of this expense. The business changes being presented retrospectively, we have recast prior periods to reflect the new treatment. The elimination of sales curve accounting has the effect of decreasing the previously reported third quarter 2013 MG&A expense by $17 million, which was offset in the first half of the year. The specific 2013 quarterly impacts are posted on our website.","Underlying free cash flow for the first 3 quarters of 2014 totaled $766.1 million. This $19.3 million increase was driven by higher net cash distributions from MillerCoors and lower cash paid for pension contributions, capital spending and interest versus last year, which were partially offset by our lower working capital benefit. Our year-to-date 2014 free cash flow included the following factors: $1.06 billion of operating cash flow and $55 million of net deductions, mainly $63 million of cash received for the accelerated termination of the Modelo joint venture in Canada, which was partially offset by cash used for restructuring activities.","Investing cash flows included $196 million of capital spending. Our underlying free cash flow included $1.05 billion of cash distributions and $1.1 billion of cash invested in MillerCoors, along with $5 million of positive adjustments from MillerCoors' cash payments for special charges and investments in businesses.","Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $3.45 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $722 million, resulting in net debt of $2.73 billion, which is $422 million lower than at the beginning of the third quarter and $753 million lower than a year ago.","Our 2014 guidance is unchanged from last quarter in the following 6 areas. Although we are not changing our 2014 underlying free cash flow target of $775 million, plus or minus 10%, we currently expect our result for the year to be in the upper half of this range, that is between $775 million and $850 million. Our capital spending guidance is approximately $315 million. Consolidated net interest expense is approximately $135 million. We expect defined benefit pension expense of approximately $35 million and cash contributions of $60 million to $90 million, including our 42% share of MillerCoors expense and cash. Corporate MG&A expense of approximately $110 million, and we anticipate our 2014 underlying effective tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 16% and the other low end of our long-term range of 20% to 24% next year, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions.","In 2014, regional cost outlook in local currency, we now expect international cost of goods sold per hectoliter to decrease in a mid-single-digit rate for the full year, driven by geographic mix and foreign currency movements. Previous guidance was for a low single-digit increase. We continue to expect MillerCoors and Canada cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase to the low single-digit rate for the full year and Europe to decrease with a low single-digit rate.","So at this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Peter?","Peter S. Swinburn","Thanks, Gavin. We continue to drive our strategy of building our core and above-premium brands and increasing sales for our innovation pipeline. In the U.S., we continue to migrate our portfolio to the high end, and new launches, like Redd's Wicked Apple, are helping to drive positive mix and an NSR per hectoliter growth.","We're in the process of changing all the primary and secondary packaging on Miller Lite to the Original white look that has worked so well on the can. And by early 2015, we will extend the redesign to every consumer touch point. Coors Light saw a new creative in the period, which brought the breadth of brand closer to the Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment proposition. We are continuing with our business transformation initiative, and we expect this initiative, combined with brand investments, to drive significantly higher MG&A expense in the fourth quarter versus 2013.","Looking to the fourth quarter in Canada, the termination of our arrangement for the Modelo brands will continue to negatively impact our comparative profit performance by approximately USD 4 million. In core brands, Molson Canadian is now loading out the next chapter of the Beer Fridge campaign, which leverages our NHL partnership. Early in 2015, Coors Light will see more retail activity and new advertising as part of our effort to turn around our largest brand.","In above-premium, consumer demand remained strong for Coors Banquet, recently relaunched Molson Canadian Cider and newly launched Mad Jack Apple Lager. During the third quarter, we agreed to extend our partnership for the marketing and distribution of the Heineken and Strong Brew brands. And starting in January, we will also be selling the rest of their top-end import brands, including Dos Equis, Tecate, Sol, Moretti and Desperados.","In Europe, in the fourth quarter, we will be increasing market investment to further strengthen our share position. Carling is being supported with heavyweight advertising like consumer promotional activity. Coors Light will be concluding its successful advertising-led ice bar activity. The Sharp's portfolio will continue to be expanded through new beer styles and Jelen will be supported by the launch of a new creative platform in Serbia. Despite weak consumer demand in Central Europe, our team continues to improve our brand health and sales execution.","Our International business plans continue to invest to drive strong growth and make additional progress towards its goal of achieving profitability by 2016.","In the fourth quarter, across all of our businesses, we anticipate higher brand investments in local currency. And at today's rates, foreign currency will be a significant headwind, primarily in Canada.","Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the fourth quarter. In the U.S. to October 25, STRs decreased to the low single-digit rate. In Canada, for all of October, they were up high single digits. Excluding the Modelo brands last year, our Canada STRs in October increased a low double-digit rate due to our switch to the Gregorian calendar, which includes 3 more days in the period this year versus last year. Our October sales volume in Europe increased at a high single-digit rate, primarily due to the change in the Gregorian calendar in the U.K. On our international sales volume, including royalty volume, increased to the double-digit rate. As ever, please keep in mind these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.","To summarize our discussion today, our third quarter results were impacted by weak consumer demand in our core markets, higher marketing spending, the loss of the Modelo brand's income Canada and unfavorable foreign currency movements. On a U.S. GAAP basis, we also had the impairment of the Jelen and O\u017eujsko brands in Europe. Despite these headwinds, we continue to build a stronger brand portfolio, deliver value-added innovation, invest in our core brands and increase our share of the premium.","We remain focused on the fundamentals of our business. We have leading brand position in the world's most profitable beer markets. We are improving the efficiency of our operations, and we are successfully combining our distribution muscle with our proven ability to innovate and grow both large and small brands. This strategy is delivering expanded gross margins, positive pricing and sales mix and cost reduction, along with steady, strong underlying EBITDA and cash returns to shareholders.","On a more personal note, with my retirement at the end of the year, I wanted to express my sincere appreciation for your interest in Molson Coors Brewing Company. It's been my great pleasure over the past 6.5 years to lead the team here and to get to know all of you. As I wrap up my final earnings conference call, I want to assure you that my transfer of leadership to Mark is progressing smoothly, and I'm confident that he and the team here will continue to drive our growth strategy and our path model through the organization, all with a goal of enhancing long-term shareholder value.","Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.","So at this point, Jonah, we'd like to open it up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess, my first question is just a little bit more color around Canada. It looks like the year-to-date volume, obviously, was relatively weak, but if you exclude the profit impact from the loss of Modelo business, it looks like your profit eggs [ph] is actually trending more positively. So I just wanted to understand how sustainable that is. It also looks like price mix was up 3% in the third quarter, which was also better than what we've seen. So can you just also talk about what's driving that improvement? And then the October number, I know there's a timing change with the Gregorian calendar. But just -- it also looks like maybe it's a better number than what we've seen, even adjusting for that calendar change. So can you just talk about the October performance in the context of what we've been seeing in Canada?","Peter S. Swinburn","Okay. Judy, I'll give Stewart a bit of thinking time, and yes, he makes a note of all those questions. But just generally, I think as far as Canada is concerned and the whole business is concerned, I mean, what you're seeing, I think, is just a continuum of what we've experienced here in Europe. Overall, nothing much has changed in the macro environment. But as we signaled in Canada, I think there's a number of things we are doing in the revenue management space, in the cost savings space. But overall, the market remains much the same, as we've experienced for the first half. Stewart, do you want to pick up the detail on the -- on Judy's questions?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Yes, sure. Thanks, Peter. So Judy, yes, look, looking at the third quarter, I mean, the biggest impact on the quarter was, as you cite, Modelo. If you remove Modelo, then the factors that really contributed to the negative were much higher spending around marketing in Q3. We called that out last quarter. And that's just due to phasing during the year, and that would've been also overcoming higher-than-expected -- oh, sorry, lower-than-normal incentive comp in Q3 of last year. So I'd say, yes, overall, results were positive. I think what we were most pleased about was the results at the gross margin line. Having said that, we still face the volume challenge, and that is the area that we're faced in our business. And in terms of your point about sustainability, volume will be important for us looking ahead. From a price mix perspective, very positive quarter, about half of that was driven by price and about half by mix, and with respect to October volumes, if you strip out the extra days, then the trends aren't dramatically different than they were in the third quarter. Does that help?","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That helps. On the price mix side, Stewart, just -- I know you've made some efforts in introducing some of the products in the high end. But just any granularity in terms of that 3% sort of price-mix combination? How sustainable is that piece?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Well, I mean, I'll just tell you the drivers of mix. I'm not going to comment on what the future looks like, but the drivers of the positive mix have been our driving harder against the above-premium space. That's the strategy for our company and that is something that, of course, we are driving harder in Canada. Second of all, we have been focused around our revenue management and have been pretty clearly focused on the returns of various promotions. So the combination of those things is what's driven the positives. Having said that, I mean, the environment, as a whole, is still very competitive.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then I guess, Gavin, just the free cash flow generation clearly coming in at the high end of your expectation, wanted to just get your view on the timing in which you get to sort of your leverage target. I think before, you said, by year-end this year or early next year. It seems like maybe that timing is getting a little bit expedited. And then just in the context of thinking about capital allocation, I know we've asked this question in the past. But with the stock price having run up year-to-date, how do you think about sort of cash return versus investing in the business versus acquisition? Just any thoughts on any changes to that strategy.","Gavin D. Hattersley","Well, the short answer to your last question, Judy, is no, no changes to the way we look at capital allocation. We will continue to look at returning cash to our shareholders. We will continue to strengthen our balance sheet and we'll continue to look to invest behind growth opportunities, specifically behind our global brands. So no, that won't change. What I did say in New York and I think I said it again in Boston was that we expect to get back to our StarBev pre-acquisition leverage ratios in the earlier part of next year. And at that point in time, obviously, share buybacks come back on to the table as a consideration set, and we'll make whatever decisions we think are in the best interest of our shareholders as we go along.","Peter S. Swinburn","All I would add to that, Judy, is whatever decisions we make will go through our path model, and that will drive the consideration as to how we allocate our capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Steib with Credit Suisse.","Michael Steib - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can I switch to the U.S., perhaps? In the press release this morning, you highlighted higher expenses relating to the business transformation initiative. I wonder if you could give us a bit more background on your initiatives there and also whether these expenses were higher than what you had initially planned. And then following on from the earlier question, do you see any opportunities in the U.S. to pursue sort of bolt-on acquisitions in the above-premium segment? Clearly, your biggest competitor there is doing exactly that.","Peter S. Swinburn","I'll let Tom pick up on the detail. But as far as business transformation is concerned, obviously, we're not going to talk in detail about how much expenditure we've got in the fourth quarter. Just to say that this is a program that's already been in the organization for a couple of years. It's driven out significant cost savings. We do have a lot of money to spend on infrastructure, specifically systems, and you're seeing the beginning of that coming through in the fourth quarter. But Tom, do you want to talk to the detail of business transformation and also the last question on the above premium?","Tom Long","Yes. Thank you, Peter. So you really hit the question. That portion of business transformation that has increased and will also increase in the fourth quarter is around systems of business process and systems. These are systems investments that we have planned, and now those expenses are coming through. Not much more to say on that. In terms of bolt-on acquisitions, it's very true that many craft brewers are on the market right now and increasingly so, and we're very engaged in a number of those discussions. We're actively looking at those that would create incremental shareholder value, but it's also no secret that those valuations are extremely high right now.","Peter S. Swinburn","Thanks, Tom. And again, just to reemphasize on that. I mean, we have, as you know, over the years, had some very successful bolt-on acquisitions, such as Doom Bar and Cobra and Creemore and so on. But the same -- we'll use the same discipline as we talked, that Gavin talked about earlier in terms of capital allocation. If we can't get a return that we want on any acquisition, big or small, then we will not undertake it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wanted to follow up on the European business and sort of trying to decipher the geographic mix, as you look at the better performance in the U.K. relative to Central Europe and how much -- what's the real sort of pricing environment look like in these markets? And how long do you think you'll continue to benefit from that mix benefit as we look at the -- some of the structural problems involved with the Central and Eastern European business?","Peter S. Swinburn","All right, okay. Well, I'll pass it on to Mark in a minute. But just as a headline, we don't deconstruct the yield of business by country, so we can't go into that detail. But Mark, do you want to give an overall flavor about pricing?","Mark R. Hunter","Sure. I mean, I think what I would do is probably contextualize this with just the summary through the third quarter overall. Sluggish industry demand, we saw across all of the markets that we operate in. Consumers really kind of contracting from a spend perspective. So all markets were negative from an industry shipment perspective. What we are seeing is, within many of the markets, a shift from core and premium towards the value segment, which I think we've already called out in relation to a couple of our markets in particular. We've had the benefit of the U.K. performing strongly that, again, we've flagged in a couple of our quarterly reports. But beyond that, I think the pricing environment will be linked very directly to the pace of economic recovery within Europe. And I think everybody in the call will be aware that Europe has got some pretty fundamental macro challenges. As we see those improve over time, then I think the pricing environment will improve.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And if I can just ask a follow-up on the -- to Judy's question on the Canada piece, related to the calendar shift. From high single digits, let's say, down to sort of like mid-singles, that's a pretty big percentage gap for 3 days. So can you just sort of help us with the math? And when did those 3 days -- I apologize for not knowing this, when did those 3 days sort of come out?","Stewart F. Glendinning","So John, in terms of when the specific days come out, I'd to go back to the calendar, have a look. Maybe Dave can pick that up in the follow-up. I can't give you too much detail on the calculation, only to say that I've had the benefit of seeing all the numbers. And I can just tell you that the trends in total don't look dramatically different than what we saw in Q3. So that's really the best advice I can give to you.","Peter S. Swinburn","I think you're just going to have to trust us on that one. If you look at the like-for-like comparison, shaking out the extra days and you take out the Modelo volume, then Canada is down low single digits.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. But I mean, wouldn't that be better than Q3?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Well, just -- I mean, look, roughly here, if you got 28 days last year and you got 3 extra days this year, I mean better than 10% right there, so rough order of magnitude, but stick with my guns.","David Dunnewald","Yes. I think what you're looking -- this is Dave Dunnewald. John, I think what you're looking at is a straight reported STR number in the third quarter for Canada was down 5.9%. That's not what Stewart's talking about. He's saying if you look at more of an apples-to-apples view in the third quarter, then take out the Modelo brands, in other words, you'd be down at a low single-digit rate and that's what we're -- we are also seeing low single-digits on an apples-to-apples basis in October.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ian Shackleton with Nomura.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","The brand write-offs that you've announced today in Europe, I guess the question is around that. I mean, firstly, why now? I think traditionally, we tend to have these things more at the end of the year. But also, does that mean that all the other brand in StarBev, you're pretty happy with in terms of the carrying value in brands and goodwill?","Peter S. Swinburn","So I'll let Gavin speak to the timing, Ian. But yes, I think your assessment is pretty much spot on. Obviously, we've not taken impairment on the overall business, so that would indicate that there's a balancing factor here. We do have a specific issue with Jelen, to a lesser extent, O\u017eujsko. It has been driven, as I said in the script, by generally weak consumer demand, which everyone is aware of. That has moved consumers towards value brands, so it's impacted on -- in that way. And also, the floods really have hit overall volume. And we try to make an assessment of what that impact will be going forward as well, so we thought it judicious, if you like, to make sure that we put those impairments into the books now. What I would say is that if you look at both brands within their category and you look at brand health -- excuse me, the brand health of O\u017eujsko is extremely strong, and it's gaining market share in its category. And Jelen, equally, with the new advertising that would be coming out in the -- in this -- the end of this year, brand health looks healthy. But the overall macro environment is such that we thought it the right thing to do to take an impairment on the brands. Gavin, do you want to?","Gavin D. Hattersley","Yes, Ian, we are required to test up goodwill and brand values on an annual basis, and we do that as at the 1st of July, beginning of our third quarter. So we have tested all our brands. We've tested our -- we've tested Europe and Canada, and these are the 2 brands that required an impairment, based on their testing.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Good. And just a quick follow-up, I think in your update for the guidance for full year on inputs and COGS, I'm not sure you mentioned the U.S. Is there any change in thinking there?","Peter S. Swinburn","No, there was no change in the thinking on the U.S. And again, it was increased low single-digits last year -- last quarter, and it's remained at increasing low single digits.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Peter, I'm sure the thing you're going to miss most when you step down is just taking all of our questions.","Peter S. Swinburn","I will miss it immensely, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, in terms of the price mix in Europe, I'm assuming -- I'm inferring from your comments that most of the benefit in price per hectoliter was mix and there really wasn't much rate. Is that right?","Peter S. Swinburn","That's correct.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then can you give us an update or a progress report, I guess, on the turnaround of -- or re-acceleration efforts for Coors Light in Canada? I'm not sure if you mentioned where -- what Coors Light volumes were in the quarter. But just trying to get a sense for how you've progressed in that turnaround.","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes. Again, I'll let Stewart give you the detail in a second. But the reality is that we looked at getting new creative in for the third quarter and what we came up with wasn't satisfactory. So we've had to go back to the drawing board on the creative. We're determined to get it right. That new creative will be hitting the streets in the beginning of 2015. So we've had a bit of a hiatus, if you like, in terms of our plans. But Stewart, do you want to talk specifically about the third quarter?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Yes, sure, Peter. I mean, Bryan, if you look to the third quarter, Coors Light was down mid-single digits. Peter summarized it in exactly the right way. And we had 2 problems of -- one was a big, emotional connection, be creative with our consumers and our in-store execution. I think the second part, the in-store execution, we've got that well in hand now. The creative appears to be going in the right direction. And probably the third thing to just think about here is that there is a cannibalization impact from Coors Banquet, which is now a national distribution. If you took Coors Banquet and Coors Light as a combined set of brands, then those 2, in total, help share in the quarter. So more work to be done in Coors Light, but Coors Banquet, performing very well.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So with the creative not being where you were looking for, does it mean that you actually spent less on Coors Light media than you would've even ordinarily spent?","Stewart F. Glendinning","No. I mean, we kept our creative -- we have enough creative materials to use. We've used some of our functional advertising around vented can, for example. So no, the answer is we haven't substantially changed that.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one related to Canada. It just -- the overall industry, just how does your adjusted volume performance compared to the industry growth rate? I wasn't sure if you had given an industry growth rate.","Stewart F. Glendinning","So we lost just under 0.5 share point in the quarter.","Peter S. Swinburn","Industry was down 1.7, Bryan.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.","Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI, Research Division","We don't get a lot of chance to ask Peter Coors questions, so I hope this is all right. I was just wondering if, perhaps, you could give your big picture perspective on the company, on the beer industry, how -- and how you see yourself positioned in the industry and what you're most excited about. I know that's kind of very broad and very loose, but just wanted to get your general thoughts and the kind of message you'd like to get out there.","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes. Rob, in fairness to Pete, he literally has just dropped in, so I don't think it's fair dropping that question on him. But I think that the view of the market, that the view of the industry is as we -- you and I have talked about on many occasions. I don't think there's much more to add on that.","Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Okay. Well, I'll ask a much more mundane question then. And pardon me, if I missed this earlier on. I think you called out a reversal of a reserve in Europe, can you give us any details on that and the size of it.","Peter S. Swinburn","Sure.","Gavin D. Hattersley","Rob, it's Gavin here. There was a provision that we recorded when we bought StarBev in 2009, and this was regards to a regulatory review that we recorded as liability upon acquisition. During the third quarter, we were excluded from that, filing the reports, and so we released the full reserve. And if you look at the decrease in Europe MG&A, which was around $11 million, it accounted for roughly half of that.","Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI, Research Division","So $5 million to $6 million?","Gavin D. Hattersley","Yes, roughly half.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Holland with SG.","Andrew Holland - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","I was actually also going to ask about that reversal. I think we've now got the size of it. Can you just tell us what the nature of it was, please?","Gavin D. Hattersley","No, we don't get into the detail of regulatory issues that we have on a country-by-country basis. Suffice to say, we've resolved the issue. The reserve's no longer required, and we released it.","Andrew Holland - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Can you tell me which country it related to?","Gavin D. Hattersley","No, we don't get into that level of detail.","Andrew Holland - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. Let me try this one. Your -- just looking at the results of the international division, the size of the losses. Just again, the 9-month figure slightly less than it was this time last year, but it looks as if it's still going to be negative for the full year. Can you give us an idea of when you might hope for your international division to breakeven, please?","Peter S. Swinburn","I'll let can Kandy talk about the specifics in the third quarter, but it's the -- any small movement in expenditure really affects the quarter disproportionally, because it's such a small business. But Andrew, we've been pretty clear over the last few years that we expect this division to breakeven. It should be in profit by 2016. Kandy, do you want to talk specifically about the third quarter impacts?","Krishnan Anand","Sure. So Andrew, in the third quarter, we've -- we're actually quite pleased both quarter and year-to-date performance. As you see, our top line has grown 20% plus, specifically Coors Light has grown extremely strong, double digits. And the difference in just the third quarter, essentially because of increased marketing spend, as we're driving [ph] that top line growth. The International businesses continues to be well on track to deliver the commitment that Peter just said, which is to be breakeven and in profit by 2016.","Andrew Holland - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","And is that going to require you to rethink your marketing support then? Because there's quite a big gap between what the run rate is now and what breakeven would imply.","Krishnan Anand","No. I don't think it'll require us to rethink. I think the main thing is our top line grows 20%. It enables us -- if you look at our gross profit, that's also growing in line with our top line. So that enables us to continue to bridge that gap.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Tristan Van Strien from Deutsche Bank.","Tristan Van Strien - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two questions, if I may. The first one is on your Latin American performance, which was pretty good. Can you just give us a bit of color on that and how things are going in Mexico and if you entered any new markets in that region? And the second thing is -- second question. I guess, you solved the issue in Canada with SABMiller. How secure do you feel your JV in the U.K. with Grolsch? And do you feel that is in danger at all in the coming year or so?","Peter S. Swinburn","Right. Well, I'll let Kandy answer the question on Latin America in a second. As far as the issue with Grolsch is concerned, no, we have total control of that brand in the U.K. It's not a JV. It's a different setup altogether. So whatever happens with the brand largely is down to -- is up to us. So it's well within our limit as to what happens with it. Kandy, do you want to talk about Latin America?","Krishnan Anand","Sure. So we're excited with the progress of Coors Light in Mexico, in Central America and in the Caribbean, which are the main markets that we are in. This is based on continued impact over the last couple of years of our Rocky Mountain Core Refreshment positioning, working with our partners to execute brilliantly in the markets as well as a lot of in-store efforts, which truly makes the brand disruptive. In terms of your question on the new markets, the only new market we have in 2014 versus 2013, which is up significant, is Australia, which we added, really, end of December last year. So it's been the first 8 months, and we're extremely pleased right now with the progress on Coors Light. As you recall, Coors there for legal reasons so far with our partner, Coca-Cola Amatil, over there.","Tristan Van Strien - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Just while you're on the line, in terms of India, your growth in Coors Light, is that mostly in Bihar state or you've expanded that as well?","Krishnan Anand","In India, we don't have Coors Light. We have local brands. It's the local brands. And our business, as mentioned in Peter's comments, has doubled. But we are basically in Bihar. We export a couple of states, but essentially 90 plus percent of our business is in Bihar.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","A couple questions. Firstly, Gavin, just a clarification, if you can, on share repo. Any sense of when you might actually communicate with us on that, given that you're going to be at that low leverage level early next year?","Peter S. Swinburn","Mark, I'm going to give Gavin a rest, because I think he's fed up of answering these questions. No disrespect to you, but we really can't tell you anything more than we've told you. We'll talk to our board as to how we allocate our capital. It's an ongoing conversation. We'll decide the best allocation between bolt-on acquisitions, dividends and share repurchase. But it is on the agenda. We've been clear about that. And when we got a decision to announce, I promise you'll be the first to know.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Fair enough. Fair enough, okay. And then a question on Canada, and I don't know, Stewart, if perhaps you're the person. But can you update us on the sector side to look at the cost structure. Obviously, you're not going to give us a number, but just how that exercise is going? And when might we hear of you on the potential for incremental savings in that market?","Peter S. Swinburn","Stewart, you probably are the right person to answer the question on Canada. But just in terms of incremental savings, I mean, what we flagged are the 2 -- we've given you an overall cost-savings target for the business and we said that we'll be in the high end of that in the first couple of years and that takes into account what we planned to do in Canada. But Stewart, do you want to give a progress report?","Stewart F. Glendinning","Yes. Look, that makes a lot of the sense, Peter. Yes, Mark, I mean, the cost -- our cost -- the program is going well, that we've been attacking both the aspects of our supply chain and COGS, and at the same time, we've been pushing very harder on our MG&A. And I think if you run some benchmarks on us versus competitors, you'll start to see that showing up in our results. So it's really all the detail I can give you, other than to say, we've got a team that's actively focused on it and delivering results.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","My understanding is the $40 million to $60 million for the total company includes a certain view for Canada. But with your new leadership there, Stewart, there's potential to add to that number as you look at the structure. Is that a fair understanding?","David Dunnewald","Mark, if I could take that, our guidance that we've been fairly consistent on since June of last year in New York was $40 million to $60 million for the next 4 years or so, with us being at the top end of that for the first 1 or 2 years, as Peter said. Last year, a lot of those cost savings came out of Europe. For the next 1 to 2 years, most of those cost savings are going to come out of Canada. So everything that Stewart is doing is in that guidance number we've given you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the presenters.","Peter S. Swinburn","Okay. Well, thank you very much, everybody. You'll have the pleasure of listening to Mark and exit the exercise for the fourth quarter, and I'm sure he will give you a much more cogent and better answers than I've been able to do for the last 6.5 years. Thank you very much, everybody.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14966":["Molson Coors Brewing Co.

Please go ahead.","Mark Swartzberg - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, thank you, Chad, and hello, everyone. I am delighted to be here at Molson Coors after being on the other side of this call for many years. Following the prepared remarks this morning, management will take your questions. In order to allow as many people to ask questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. That's one follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please return to the queue.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mark Hunter.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thank you, Mark, and hello, and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call. With me on the call this morning are Tracey Joubert, our CFO; the CEOs of each of our four business units: Lee Reichert, our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; and Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller.","Today, Tracey and I will be take you through our plans to drive long-term and total shareholder returns, highlighting our third quarter results and also discuss our outlook for the business. As usual, we're offering related slides on the Investor Relations page of our website. Before doing that, I would like to take a moment to recognize the passing of Bill Coors earlier this month. Our company stands on the shoulders of giants like Bill, who was a Chairman of Coors for over 40 years, and we honor his memory by rededicating ourselves to continuing the work he loved so much, brewing highest-quality beer to share with family and friends, one of life's simple pleasures.","Now this quarter reflects progress on a number of fronts, as we drive our consistent First Choice strategy of earning more, using less and investing wisely. Brand volume grew in developed and developing markets outside of North America. NSR per hectoliter grew globally. We announced incremental cost reductions in the U.S. to protect investment and counter inflation. We grew underlying EBITDA in constant currency in each of our four business units. We further paid down debt as our teams across the business reduced working capital and cash taxes. And in early October, we completed the formation of Truss, our Canadian cannabis joint venture, naming Brett Vye as CEO. Brett is a long-standing commercial leader and most recently served as the Chief Commercial and Strategy Officer for our fast growing International division.","In relation to debt pay down, we've generated $2.5 billion of underlying free cash flow since the end of 2016. We're committed to $1.5 billion, plus or minus 10%, in free cash flow for this year. Additionally, we remain committed to our plan for rating agency leverage of 3.75 times by mid-2019, our current dividend payment, and the dividend intentions we communicated in June of this year.","Let me now turn to underlying business trends and our outlook. The volume growth we are seeing outside North America is driven by consistency of our First Choice strategy, the breadth and depth of our global brand portfolio, and a positive industry. Europe, our second largest business unit by volume, is growing consistently and accelerating the pace of portfolio premiumization, while our International business unit led by the Latin American markets posted mid-teens growth due to the strong performance of our global brands, led by Coors Light and the Miller Trademark brands of MGD, Miller Lite and Miller High Life.","Turning to North America, in the U.S. brand volumes or STRs were below industry volumes. As we've indicated, improving our volume performance in the U.S. is a priority, and the first step is to improve our share performance through Coors Light and accelerated premiumization of the portfolio. In the quarter, Coors Light STRs declined a moderating rate sequentially. Miller Lite continued to take share in premium lights and also declined a moderating rate. Above premium trends improved sequentially, benefiting from Peroni and Sol, our regional craft brands, Arnold Palmer Spiked and Henry's Hard Sparkling.","In Canada, brand volume trends improved sequentially and the Miller Trademark and Belgian Moon brand grew strongly in the quarter. We continue to make progress in relation to stabilizing and improving the volume and profitability of our Canadian business and returning this business to growth.","Turning to outlook, we remain committed to our performance guidance for 2018, and I'll comment in more detail on each of our business units after passing the call to Tracey. Before I do that, let me offer a few comments about how our organization is focused on earning more, using less, and investing wisely by utilizing our Profit after Capital Charge, or PACC model. We believe we have the right strategy to grow shareholder value over the medium to long-term. That strategy has delivered consistent business performance improvements over the past three years. And as I mentioned, we remain committed to our 2018 guidance despite a more challenging inflationary environment.","In terms of top line performance, characterized as earning more, we continue to drive our First Choice approach, strengthening and premiumizing our brand portfolio, building powerful customer relationships and driving disruptive growth. To this last point, our new Truss cannabis joint venture is just one example of this. The combination of Molson Coors Canada and HEXO, the cannabis market leader in Qu\u00e9bec, offers a tremendous opportunity to shape the nonalcoholic cannabis-infused beverages category upon its planned legalization in Canada in the fall of 2019. And we believe we will secure a meaningful share of this potentially high-value category and prepare ourselves for potential further International expansion.","Using less is our second platform and is designed to fuel growth and protect our bottom line performance. We are over-delivering on our synergy plan, and we continue to make great progress on improving productivity through shared services, which is scaling rapidly, and world class supply chain improvements. We also decided to execute incremental cost reductions in the U.S. to protect our marketing investment and counter inflation. And as Tracey will cover, we expect to over-deliver on our current three-year total cost-savings guidance.","Investing wisely is our third platform, and we remain resolute on our deleverage commitments, returning cash to shareholders currently planned via dividend increase in 2019 and strengthening our business through brand-led growth opportunities.","Finally, I want to highlight our eighth year of recognition on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, reflecting not only our performance to index standards, but also a series of activities are aiding revenue and margins and ensuring to leave a positive Beer Print wherever we operate.","So, with that context, I'll pass it over to Tracey.","Tracey I. Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. Before I share consolidated and regional financial highlights, I'd like to remind you of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which we will refer to as the revenue recognition for the remainder of the prepared remarks today.","As outlined in our earnings release, this is expected to have no significant impact to net income for the full-year, but will cause some timing differences between quarters, impacting some year-over-year comparability for net sales and MG&A primarily in the U.S. and Canada this quarter.","For example, revenue recognition positively impacted EPS by $0.02 this quarter and negatively impacted EPS by $0.04 on a year-to-date basis, but this timing difference is expected to partially reverse and result in a benefit of approximately $0.03 in the fourth quarter.","I will speak first to the quarter on a consolidated and regional basis, then anticipated savings, and finally to our capital allocation plans. Turning to our performance for the quarter, as highlighted in our earnings release, net sales increased 2.5% in constant currency. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 0.4% in constant currency. Worldwide brand volume decreased 1%, and financial volume increased 0.8%.","Global priority brand volume decreased 1.4%. Underlying EBITDA increased 11.1% on a constant-currency basis. And looking more closely at Q3, two specific positive performance drivers benefited EBITDA in the quarter. First, shipments to support ordering system implementations at our U.S. breweries as indicated and forecast in both our Q1 and Q2 calls.","These shipments increased distributor inventory levels \u2013 sorry, inventory to levels at which they're expected to remain through the end of the year. This is in order to prepare for future implementations at our remaining breweries, which are expected to occur in 2019. And second, the amicable resolution of a dispute with a U.S. vendor.","Financial highlights for the regions include the following: In the U.S., underlying EBITDA increased 10.2% versus last year, driven by higher STWs from an increase in distributor inventories, higher net pricing and lower MG&A expenses, partially offset by higher COGS, particularly aluminum and freight.","Our top-line growth this quarter was driven by the planned increase in U.S. distributor inventories and NSR per hectoliter growth. In Europe, underlying EBITDA increased 5.8% on a constant currency basis driven by top-line results with both volume and NSR per hectoliter growth.","Bottom-line results also benefited from strong cost management and more efficient marketing investments. As discussed in our prior calls this year, when modeling the results of Europe, remember that Q4 historically represents a small quarter for Europe and also faces the headwind of a low-single-digit negative-impacted quarter to NSR per hectoliter related to the adoption of recently-revised industry guidelines for calculating excise tax.","Our Canada underlying EBITDA increased 3.5% on a constant-currency basis. The top line reflected a 1.4% decline in brand volume as a result of lower volumes in the west, partially offset by volume growth in Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec. When excluding the effects of revenue recognition, NSR per hectoliter would have increased 1.6%.","Regarding International, underlying EBITDA grew as the top line benefited from an increase in brand volume as all three focus brands Coors Light, MGD and Miller Lite generated growth. The bottom line also reflected gross profit expansion in addition to lower MG&A spending levels.","Our earnings release provides full details on our (12:27) guidance, and I'll comment on three of those items here. To account for the heightened inflationary environment, especially in the U.S. as it relates to aluminum and freight costs, we will over-deliver on our cost-savings targets and cost-mitigation efforts in order to deliver on our cash flow commitments both for 2018 and 2019. We will update our actual 2017 to 2019 cost-savings targets and performance, as well as our next generation of cost savings for 2020 to 2022 in Q1 of 2019. However, as of now, with the additional cost saving initiatives in the U.S., as well as other cost savings initiatives, our 2017 to 2019 program will deliver approximately $700 million versus the $600 million to which we guided previously.","We expect corporate net interest expense for 2018 to be near the low end of our $350 million plus or minus 10% guidance range. And we have lowered our expected underlying effective tax rate for 2018 to 17% to 19% from 18% to 22%. We still expect free cash flow to be $1.5 billion plus or minus 10% this year.","As Mark said, we remain committed to our plan for raising agency leverage of 3.75 times by mid-2019. Our current dividend payments and our dividend intentions are unchanged versus what we communicated in June.","As for business investment, we continue to use PACC to inform and guide all of our decisions, delivering total shareholder returns will be driven by a balanced approach to earning more, using less and investing wisely as we position our portfolio and company for long-term growth.","At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark to talk about our commercial excellence around the world.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Tracey. Earning more is one of the three platforms by which we drive PACC, and this pillar is built on commercial excellence. I'd like to give you some evidence of commercial excellence starting with our success premiumizing globally, then touching on how we're doing in our four business units.","Across all of our markets, premiumization of our portfolio remains an important element of our strategy. And our above-premium brands grew 3.6% in the quarter, driven principally by Europe and International, bringing in their share of our total volume up to 21% of our portfolio from 20% last year.","In the U.S., we believe we have the right strategy and commercial execution to drive improving performance in response to current top line challenges. Premium Light trends improved sequentially versus the first half driven especially by the strong performance from Miller Lite. Our plans are to continue gaining share of segment in the American light lager category with a bold competitive position of Miller Lite and reenergizing Coors Light as the world's most refreshing beer. The brand has just launched a new Blue Mountain cold beer digital campaign in October as part of our push to capture the attention of 21 to 34-year-old drinkers.","Brian Rice, (15:39) who led the Miller Lite turnaround has recently become the leader of the Coors Trademark and family of brands.","And above premium and craft, Peroni and Sol are posting the strongest percentage growth rates in their respective import segments, delivering highly profitable incremental cases to distributers and retailers.","We'll build on the success from Sol with introduction of the best-selling Mexican ready to drink Chelada next year. Our regional craft brands continue to grow strongly and build their regional footprint. One of our regional craft brands, Saint Archer, will test a new lower calorie and lower carb craft lager, Saint Archer Gold early next year in four markets.","In FMBs, our Q3 performance was an improvement sequentially reflecting growing contribution from Henry's Hard Sparkling, the only sugar free hard seltzer and Arnold Palmer Spiked. And we're also excited about the introduction of Cape Line next year, a new line of low calorie FMBs to be supported by national advertising.","Finally, in terms of customer excellence, our U.S. sales teams were recognized as the number one chains team in the most recent Advantage group survey amongst all branded beverages. And this is a real testament to driving our First Choice for customer agenda.","In Europe, core brands grew and our above premium brands grew at high single digits rates in the quarter. For example, global brands Coors light, MGD and Blue Moon, collectively, grew double digits in the quarter and Staropramen is nearing two million hectoliters in markets outside of its home Czech market.","We believe we have the right strategy in Europe defending our share of national champion brands, while premiumizing our portfolio and driving profitability through innovation and added strength for our global brands and our superior execution.","In Canada, our commercial performance improved sequentially. We simplified our value segment offerings with the Pilsner and Black Label brands, and lifted and shifted the Miller High Life brand into Canada, gaining additional segment share. We saw sequentially improving segment share for Coors Light and we're driving category development in the nonalcohol segment through Coors Edge, our newest nonalcoholic offering along with our partner brand Heineken 0.0, which are both performing very strongly in their first year in market. And we're investing wisely, expecting future operating efficiencies through a new highly efficient brewery in British Columbia, which remains on track for brewing in 2019, and a new brewery in Qu\u00e9bec which had its groundbreaking ceremony earlier this month.","Our International business is expected to continue to contribute meaningful volume and profitability to the company, with our commercial efforts centered on focus brands and focused markets. Two of these high-potential focus markets include Mexico, with our shift to local production reflecting increased profitability, and Paraguay, growing significantly this quarter with MGD now the top brand in the premium segment. We remain focused on delivering underlying constant-currency EBITDA of $20 million to $25 million this year in our International business.","Across Molson Coors, we're overdelivering on our synergy and cost savings program to counter higher than anticipated commodity inflation and maintain our deleverage commitment and dividend plan. Coming back to PACC and our efforts to drive shareholder value, we're pleased to be deleveraging at the pace we are and look forward to upping our cash returns to shareholders next year, while taking a more balanced approach to capital allocation.","So with that summary, remember, our prepared remarks and slides will be on our website for your reference later this afternoon. Mark and Kevin will be available via telephone or email to assist with any additional questions.","Chad, at this stage we'd like to open it up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question will come from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much. A question for Mark Hunter. In your opening comments, I believe, you, kind of, put out a little bit of a tantalizing teaser, if you will, saying that you think that Truss, your joint venture in cannabis, can get meaningful \u2013 if I got it right \u2013 meaningful market share in the recreational market starting in 2019. I was wondering if you could go into that in a little bit more detail in terms of, kind of, your reasons to believe and what you think \u2013 what percentage of the Canadian market on the recreational side you think will likely go into beverages and your strategy for that.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hey, Robert. Thanks for the question. I wasn't trying to be tantalizing. I was just trying to be very straightforward, so let me cover that. I mean, we decided as a business that we did not want to be a spectator as this new market opened up. And we clearly wanted to be a participant. We think we've got a very balanced and thoughtful approach with our partnership with HEXO to create Truss. And clearly, there are lots of numbers which are being bandied around with regard to the potential size of the cannabis market in Canada. I think, if you take an average, then it suggests that this market may be somewhere between $7 billion and $10 billion in market value, with beverages somewhere between 20% and 30%. And that's obviously nonalcoholic cannabis-infused beverages.","Even if you take the low end of that estimate, then it suggests that the beverages segment could be circa $1.5 billion of value. If you look at the strength of our go-to-market in Canada, if you look at our understanding of Canadian consumers and our understanding of brand-building in Canada and the capability that we have through our partner in HEXO, we believe that we're well-placed to be ready to take a meaningful share of that segment when it's legislated for and opens up in the fall of 2019. We have our CEO in place. That team is being built. We're already in research around the portfolio and the beverages that will be offered, and we will be able to share those with you as we get into the early part of 2019. But we'll be in a ready-to-go position and one of the first on the playing field as that market opens up.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","And just to get to that point that you're talking about, meaningful share, whatever that is \u2013 and I know you can't put a number to that. But can you give us a sense of how much incremental investment you may have to do to get to that point?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, I mean, we haven't gone into detail on that, Robert, as the capitalization of the JV is within our current capital guidance, so this is going to be a lean business that will lean on the partnership that we have with HEXO and the knowledge that we have from a route-to-market basis. Now, clearly, we'll be in start-up mode from now through to the fall of 2019, so we'll be building the business. And as we currently are doing testing around the shape of the portfolio, we'll then be into revenue generation from the fall of 2019 and then into 2020 and beyond. So, I think as that team is in place, we'll be able to share more of that detail with you as we get through the early part of 2019.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","But just in terms of ballpark, would it be fair to say we're talking tens of millions rather than hundreds of millions?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","In terms of investment?","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","In terms of incremental investment, yes.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","It would be on the tens, not the hundreds for sure.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question will be from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Hi, everyone.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hey, Judy.","Tracey I. Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hi, Judy.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, it's nice to see continued focus on cost savings and driving the margin expansion. I guess, just into context of U.S. STR being still down 4% year-to-date, Mark, I know in the prepared comments you talked about turning around Coors Light as one of the key priorities, but it seems like the brand is actually getting a bit worse in the scan channel.","So, just give us kind of your roadmap of what you really think you need to do on Coors Light. And maybe even thinking about sort of a broader revamping of the portfolio strategy as you kind of look at your Light brands. I mean, why not just focus on Miller Lite? That seems to be doing much better and just put more resources behind that brand.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Thanks, Judy. There was a lot in your question and I'll pass over to Gavin shortly. I mean, one of the things we've tried to do Judy as we've come through this year is use the case study of how we reshaped our UK portfolio over a period of time. It was a very Carling-centric portfolio. Carling is still our biggest brand, but we have dramatically changed the shape and the premium nature or above premium nature of that portfolio.","And that's really the path that we're on in the U.S., so it's always the (25:35), which is we have to defend resolutely our big positions in Miller Lite and Coors Light, while at the same time continuing to reshape the portfolio and drive in above premium direction. That's the path we're on and the plan that's in place.","The notion of choosing Miller Lite over Coors Light or vice versa is not something we contemplate. If you go back to the end of 2016 and early 2017, both brands were taking share of Premium Light segment very consistently. Both brands were declining low-single digits. And we're feeling very, very good about that as part of our kind of growth algorithm for the U.S. business.","The last three or four quarters have been disappointed for Coors Light, and in simple terms our work has been good and actually good is not good enough for Coors Light. The work needs to be world-class, and that's what the team are focused on delivering as we leave 2018 and go into 2019. The positioning of both Coors Light and Miller Lite is still highly relevant to today's drinkers. We've demonstrated that we can dramatize that very effectively on Miller Lite.","And interestingly, if you look at our STRs for Q3 versus the first half of this year, our STRs in the third quarter were sequentially better by about 100 basis points from the first half of this year. So, we clearly still have got work to do, but we're very clear about what that work is and we're on it.","Gavin, I maybe went into a bit too much detail there, but anything you would add to that?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Not a lot I can add to that, Mark. I think you answered the question perfectly. The only thing I might add is to say that Coors Light is the second largest brand in the United States and we think it and Miller Lite (27:14) Premium Light, and certainly have no intention of giving up on Coors Light.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Gavin, if I could just follow-up on the inventory levels now, so I know this is something you talked about in the first half in terms of building inventory ahead of the implementation of the new ordering system. So, at these levels now, we're kind of the level where you feel pretty satisfied with, and if you kind of look out to the fourth quarter, should we think about STR and STW pretty much being in line? Or should we still see shipments outperforming STR in the fourth quarter?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","I think you're reading it exactly right, Judy. We've got the shipment, inventories to where we want them to be and I wouldn't anticipate inventories growing any further in the fourth quarter.","Operator","The next question will come from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, everyone.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hi, Amit.","Tracey I. Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hi, Amit.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Tracey, thanks for clarifying the revenue recognition impact in 3Q and 4Q. Can you also give us a little bit clarity on the gross margin reversal from inventory build? How much was realized in third quarter and how much is still to be realized in the fourth quarter?","Tracey I. Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, Amit. So, just in terms of revenue, I'd just also let you know that there is a table in our filings with more detail, if you do want to just refer to that as well. It is laid out quite nicely. In terms of the reversal, so as we said in Q1 and Q2, our STWs were under the STRs for a number of reasons including the issues that we were facing with the Golden go live. The majority of that has now reversed in Q3. We did say that we thought it would reverse in the back half, but it has reversed in Q3 and to Gavin's earlier point, the inventory levels are now at a satisfactory level. We don't expect to build any further inventory in the fourth quarter. So, hopefully that's helpful.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That definitely is. And then, Mark, can you just if you look at the press release, it looks like the COGS inflation in the U.S. moderated a little bit from Q2. Are we seeing near peak levels from a COGS inflation pressure? And then just related to that, on pricing how much of the pricing is currently reflected and how much is still to be realized as you roll through pricing in the U.S.?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, well, let me pick up COGS, and then Gavin if you just want to talk about where we are on the pricing cycle. I mean, if you look at COGS across our business, in International, Europe and Canada, we expect COGS to grow back in the low single digits. We still expect the U.S. to be mid-single digits. So I think the inflation pressure that we have got that we've been seeing is already baked into our guidance around COGS.","Clearly the unknowns as we go into 2019 and we will be able to guide on this as we get to the early part of 2019, it's just outlook on aluminum and freight. That's still certainly in freight moving around a little bit at the moment. But I think, the guidance we've given you feels solid at this stage on COGS.","Gavin, do you want to talk on the pricing environment?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Mark. But I'll just add one thing to the U.S. COGS, specifically. Remember, Amit, that we under-shipped quite meaningfully in the first half of the year and we over-shipped in the third quarter to get inventories back to where they were, and so this was quite a big deleverage swing between the two. That would be the biggest driver between COGS in the first half and the third quarter in the U.S.","From a pricing environment point of view, we are right in the middle of our price increase cycle, and obviously we will assess over the next month or so how those price increases hold. From a third quarter point of view, we generated 1.3% NSR per hectoliter increase, with a front-line of about 1.8% and a mix of about 60 basis points, which was negative, but sequentially improved over both the first quarter number of 90 basis points negative and the second quarter number of 80 basis points negative.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Gavin, just a clarification on that. So the list price increases in the marketplace already across the entire portfolio?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","No, not across the entire portfolio, and not across the entire country. We do it on a market-by-market, brand-by-brand basis. I would say to you though the majority of our price increases are taken in the fall though. We do have some markets that take in the spring, but most of it is in the fall.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question will come from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Maybe just a couple of cleanups to start on the quarter. You called out a benefit to MG&A this quarter resulting from the amicable resolution of the vendor dispute. Perhaps this will be in the Q, but I was wondering if you can just quantify that benefit?","And then on the incremental cost savings that you announced, are these \u2013 should we view these as newly identified structural savings or will they be better described more as belt tightening measures that may drift back into the business assuming category headwinds moderate?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, so in terms of the MG&A benefit, Stephen, that's subject to confidential agreement. So, we can't talk in any more detail other than what we've already disclosed. And I'm afraid you'll just have to go with us on that one because of the nature of our agreement. That agreement is not with an ongoing supplier, so it doesn't affect any of our ongoing supply relationships.","In terms of the cost savings, as we came through Q1 and Q2, we talked about our desire to do two things. One was to drive further cost avoidance through 2018 to counter that inflation, and also to continue to drive our cost reduction program. Cost avoidance is one-off in nature because it's basically postponement of costs from one year to the other. Cost reduction is absolute structural reduction in our business, and what we've talked through today with an increase from $600 million to $700 million is a structural reduction in the cost base of our business.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's great. Thank you. And then as I \u2013 I know it's early to talk about 2019, but just given that you've got this plan out there to achieve 3.7 times leverage by middle of next year, I was hoping if you could talk a little bit to us about the pathway from here to there in terms of the dynamic of STWs versus STRs over that timeframe. Because there's a lot of moving parts, especially in the U.S. when you factor in the building of inventories ahead of system implementations now that might unwind in early 2019, offset by the fact that we're cycling Golden and the adverse shipment timing of 2018 next year. So I don't know if this is a question for Mark or for you, Gavin, but just any help you could provide in terms of do you expect a net favorable STW versus STR shipment timing dynamic over the pathway to mid-2019? Is it more net neutral? Or is there a reason to believe that it's actually a headwind? Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Steven, to be fair, I mean, I wouldn't connect the two. I mean, our STW to STR, kind of, flight path is very much in line with what we've already tried to do in the U.S., which is to ship to demand. Clearly, there's volatility because we have multiple go-lives across our brewery network. And the intention is to be through those around the middle of next year.","So both Gavin and Tracey have talked about for the balance of this year we don't expect to see any further STW builds. I would disconnect that from our total deleverage plan. That's based and driven by the strength of our free cash flow. We're very clear about the debt obligations we have for pay-down in the first couple of quarters of next year. All of that's factored into the commitment that we gave from earlier this year.","And I think the encouraging thing is, assuming that we hit those commitments which we intend to do, and as we get into the second half of next year and then into 2020, even with the planned dividend increase, we still then have further flexibility in terms of our cash-use approach. And that could be further deleveraged. It can be further returning cash to shareholders beyond the dividend. And it could be brand-led growth opportunities. So we get much more back to, I would describe as, business-as-usual as we get into the second half of 2019 and then into 2020.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah.","Operator","The next question will be from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Couple of questions. I guess, first just to follow-up from Robert Ottenstein's question at the beginning of the call. He was talking \u2013 he was asking about investment, and I was, kind of, not clear what it was, we were talking about capital or P&L investment. So just one question is, to the extent that there's some investment behind the cannabis and cannabis products in Canada, is there \u2013 will there be any potential meaningful P&L implication that we might have to think about as we're looking into 2019 and 2020?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Let me pick that up, Bryan. So in terms of the capitalization of the JV, all of that's already in our current cash-use forecast. And so we'll do that within our current kind of envelope of available cash. And from an OpEx perspective, then clearly there will be some start-up OpEx as we put people in place. We've announced Brett in role as the leader of that business. He's recruiting a team. This isn't going to be a massive team. It's going to be a small, lean, fit-for-purpose team that will be working on utilizing both the HEXO route to market and the Molson Coors knowledge and route to market where appropriate. So there'll be some OpEx as we build up that team, and then obviously we get into revenue generation really from the fourth quarter of next year and into 2020. So there could be a little bit of a headwind from an OpEx perspective as we build the team, and we'll manage that in the context of our total Canadian P&L.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And then second question just related to \u2013 for Gavin, I guess \u2013 related to Coors Light in the U.S. I guess, again, as we're trying to just think about a path to rebuilding momentum, to the extent that you \u2013 how quickly do you think \u2013 do you expect that you're \u2013 you will have the right ad copy, the right positioning, the right marketing to really be able to kind of put your foot back on the gas behind that brand? Is that middle of next year? Do you expect to hit the gate \u2013 hit the ground running at the beginning of the year? Just trying to understand how long it's going to take before we feel \u2013 where you expect that you'll be able to kind of go full throttle behind that brand again.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Gavin, do you want to pick that up?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Surely. Look, Bryan, I don't \u2013 I don't \u2013 I'm not going to put a timeline on it, right? But I will tell you we're moving quickly to stabilize the trends of Coors Light and get it back onto a solid footing and we've started that. Brand's at its best when it's laser focused on its messaging and makes it absolutely clear what makes Coors Light different than the competition. We think we focused too much on Rocky Mountain lifestyle and not enough on what makes Coors Light unique as the world's most refreshing beer.","And we've just launched a new digital campaign which is going to be a push to capture the attention of the younger 21 to 34-year-old drinkers. I mean, we think we have a whole generation of drinkers that don't know about our cold activated packaging and we want to give them reasons to believe and understand that Coors Light is the world's most refreshing beer.","So we're not waiting till next year. We've already started that process. I'm not going to call it victory by any manner or means, but the last two four-week reads on Coors Light has it stabilized and flat from a segment share in Premium Lights. So you're going to see a lot of work rolling out. Started a couple of weeks ago and you're going to see it continue through next year where we \u2013 where we bring this whole graphic expression to life.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you, everyone.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Bryan.","Tracey I. Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","Our next question will be from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hello?","Operator","Please go ahead, Andrea.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Yes, sorry. Sorry for that. So I was hoping you can elaborate \u2013 sorry \u2013 more on the cost reduction. I understand the $100 million increase is more sustainable cost reduction, but I was hoping to see how much \u2013 what was the positive surprise from the initial guidance of $600 million.","And I recognize that you don't want to update your annual guidance at this stage, but could you provide some color on the addition $100 million has been realized year-to-date and perhaps where you're pulling from the next 2020 to 2022?","And as a follow-up on the previous question, on the cost avoidance, is there anything that we should be aware of? I mean, you \u2013 Mark, you said that potentially that's going to come back in 2019. So I was hoping to see if that's part of the Coors Light kind of repositioning. What should we \u2013 what should we be looking at this cost avoidance going into 2019? Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Let me try and kind of unpack. I mean, I'll ask Tracey to talk in a little bit of detail. But just as context, remember where we are. So we're in the middle of our three-year cost reduction program. If you remember, that started with guidance around $550 million that we moved to $600 million and we've now increased to $700 million. So that's the three-year program that runs 2017 to 2019. So not only are we on track, but the total scale of that cost reduction, so integration synergies and cost reduction combined, has now been stepped up further.","We'll talk to you about 2020 to 2022 and the next generation cost savings when we get on our call in February of 2019. So that's the headline. So just remember that there's one program in flight. We've scaled that up and those are structural, additional cost reductions. There will then be a new program which will capture things like the new breweries in Canada, et cetera, and our ongoing cost reduction programs and more of that to follow in the early part of next year. Tracey?","Tracey I. Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, so, Andrea, hi. Just in terms of your comment around the positive surprise, so it actually wasn't a surprise. I mean, this was planned and as we hit it into this year and continued to see the inflationary environment that we were facing, particularly around aluminum and freight, it was necessary for us to accelerate some cost savings, as well as action more cost savings to mitigate against that inflation and also make sure that we are protecting the investment behind our brand.","So the majority of the incremental $100 million is coming from the U.S. restructuring, which we made public in the last quarter. And, again, the majority of that, because that restructuring has just taken place and is still taking place, the majority of that cost savings of $100 million incremental will take place in 2019, but we're not giving specific guidance for 2018. But based on the timing of the restructure, you can build the majority of that for next year.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And there was Steve's question about the cost avoidance. Is there any color you can give us? What was postponed for 2019 that we should be aware?","Tracey I. Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","So, I mean, when we talk about cost avoidance, as Mark said earlier, it's really a one-time benefit. So, the types of things that go into cost avoidance would be, for example, if we got any vacancies in the business, we just don't fill those for a while or we may cut back on certain travel, et cetera, but we don't specifically call that out in any of the guidance that we give. And in terms of 2019, as Mark said, we'll update you with that on our Q4 call early in 2019.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's fair. Thank you, Tracey. Thank you, Mark.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thank you.","Tracey I. Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Andrea.","Operator","The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Good morning.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hi, Lauren.","Tracey I. Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hello, Lauren.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was hoping you could \u2013 hey. Just to talk a little bit more about some of the recent updates and changes to the organization in the U.S. So, it was sort of clear to me that some of the cost savings was going to have to come from this restructuring, but I was curious about more functionally the changes that you've made, the new management positions you've \u2013 management positions, you've made some changes to, just help us understand a little bit the rationale, what you hope you can do better going forward because of this new org structure and what it really sort of looks like, what's different going forward than maybe was the case let's call it a year ago.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay, Lauren. The challenge for Gavin and the team is to make sure and this is true across all of our businesses that we're constantly looking at how we can be fit for future. So, just looking at inflationary environment, growth opportunities and ensuring we've got the right capability.","And there are lots of examples across our business where, for example, we've introduced the enterprise growth team because we know that we want to change the trajectory of the business over the medium term and that team have been chasing down the opportunity in cannabis, the opportunity in brewed beverages, with things like Clearly Kombucha and securing partnerships on things like Sol and Arnold Palmer.","So, there we've actually put some incremental heads into our business, because we know that we've got to disrupt some of the trajectory that we've seen from a top line perspective, and that's starting to pick up traction now. And then, each of our businesses then we got to make sure that relative to the inflationary environment we're seeing and the growth in the business that we are as lean as possible. And that was a context against which Gavin and the team led the reorg.","So, Gavin, do you want to just talk about where that's panning out without getting lost in too much of the detail?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Well, I mean, we're largely through it, Mark. And we do have some folks that will be with us for the next few months, but the program is largely complete. I think, Lauren, we didn't do a blanket cut across the organization. We looked at every function, and we made changes that we believed were appropriate.","We've been very clear about what we want to focus on and what work we're not going to do. We tried to make sure that our commercial front-facing side of the business was limited in its impact. That doesn't mean there was no impact because there was, but it was limited in terms of how our distributors see us going to the market.","I think the new structure is going to allow us to be much more disciplined. It's going to make us \u2013 it's going to allow us to make decisions much more quickly, much more nimbly going forward. As Tracey says, most of the benefit will come next year. I mean, there will be some in the fourth quarter, but most of it will come next year.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then I also was curious if you could talk a little bit about Canada. So, STR has improved. I think it's the third quarter in a row and underlying sales up strong. Can you just talk about \u2013 and then, Mark, this has historically been a little bit choppy. So, can you just talk about what change that you feel like is \u2013 whether this is sustainable and particularly as it relates to kind of Coors Light and then the balance between Premium and Economy brands?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. So I'll ask Fred to talk to some of the specifics, but the headline here is that we did commit to turn our Canadian business around from a profit performance, and I'm encouraged that we're really starting to see some of the improvements, that we're seeing consistent sequential improvement in the business both top to bottom line, and we feel that we've got with some of the portfolio additions that we've made in the last 12 to 18 months, definitely the right portfolio to compete. But, Fred, do you want to just give a little bit more color on Canada, on the priorities that you've laid out under your leadership for the business?","Frederic Landtmeters - Molson Coors Canada, Inc.","Sure. So from a portfolio perspective, we have always said we would focus on three priorities in different segments. So, first of all, in the economy segments, we said we would simplify the portfolio, we would launch Miller High Life. That actually has really generated earlier results and continuing to do so. So we're seeing strong segment share growth and also category share growth in that segment. And to your question earlier on, yes, I do think that's sustainable and that's definitely what we're focused on going forward.","From a Coors Light and premium segment perspective, we're noting a few quarters of sequential segment share improvements. Share in the segment is still negative, but just to give you a sense of magnitude, we have now got a couple of quarters where we have halved the share decline compared to where we were earlier or in the beginning of the year.","In the above premium and craft segments, Heineken is growing nicely. So absolute \u2013 so segment share growth but also absolute volume growth. Belgian Moon which is our national focus from a craft perspective is continuing to grow double digits. So while I do see opportunities to continue to improve and accelerate the growth especially in the premium and above premium part of the portfolio, we are pleased with the results we're currently seeing.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Question with respect to MG&A in your U.S. business. So a couple strong quarters in a row now, down mid-single digits, and I'm adjusting in the third quarter here for the resolution of the vendor dispute. So a couple questions. One, can you share whether advertising was also down at a similar level, that being mid-single digits in the quarter? And if so, is that the appropriate level given some of the top line headwinds?","And then, Tracey, maybe talk a little bit about just the sustainability of this level of decline given fixed cost inflation, given the need to invest behind the business. So as we think about Q4 and we think about next year, is this the case where 2Q, 3Q down this level was particularly strong and we should be thinking about more moderate levels of declines in MG&A?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Kevin, it's Mark here. I mean, let me give you a bit of context. And we don't break out M from G&A. But if you just look at the third quarter and remove the impact of revenue recognition, our total marketing investment was down low single digits. So we still invested well over $400 million across our organization in support of our brand equity building.","And some of that is because we continue to try and drive our spend per hectoliters consistent so volumes are down. We try and maintain our spend per hectoliter, but take into account any, kind of, volume reductions. And we continue to see the benefit of some of our procurement savings across our whole marketing group and the benefit of ROMI, where we're driving more efficient utilization of our marketing dollars.","But just to give you a sense of magnitude, we still invested well over $400 million in marketing and that was down very low single digits year-on-year. I think, your broader point about cost reductions and marketing spend, I mean, that's a live conversation in our business. We try and flex (52:29) that as we go through the year and we've demonstrated our ability to flex that (52:32)","Tracey, anything you'd add?","Tracey I. Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, what I would add is, and I think we state this cost savings is just a way of life at Molson Coors. We continue to look for efficiencies. Part of our cost savings programs that we have spoken about for 2019 as well, includes items such as IT consolidation as well as our global business services center in Romania and the regional one that we have opened in Milwaukee. So that will continue to generate cost savings. And as we ramp up those initiatives, we'll just continue to look at effectiveness and efficiencies of all of our G&A areas.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. If I could squeeze in one more. Mark, this one would be for you. So some of the Nielsen trends in October suggest some slowing broadly in the U.S. beer category. Do you care to comment if that's what you're seeing in your portfolio as well? There might be some hurricane impact in there. If so, why do you think that's the case? And then looking out beyond just sort of October, there was an ambition to get back to flat volume growth this year. Is that a reasonable ambition longer term? If so, would you care to frame the potential timeline to achieve that? Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. So, Kevin, just as a reminder, I mean, we stopped talking about short-term for weekly sales numbers because it was just proving to \u2013 to be honest, just to be a distraction. And there's always so much volatility in any four-week period, as you say, whether it's hurricanes or weather or other bits and pieces.","I would remind you as well the scanner data only covers about 40% of the U.S. beer industry. So it's indicative, but it does not by any stretch of the imagination give a complete picture and that's why you quite often see a disconnect between our STRs, which are real, and scan data which is part of the marketplace. So I'd just ask you to bear that in mind, but I'm not in a position to comment on October specifically.","I think with regard to your broader point, Gavin and I have been very consistent that with the aspiration that was in place since really 2015 within the U.S. business of back to flattened growth has proven to be more challenging as the industry has been softer and Coors Light performance hasn't helped.","So we've been clear as we've come through this year that the aspiration to stabilize the business from a volume perspective is still strategically very important to us, but we've got to do this in a way which allows us to continue to maintain the strength of our P&L. Job number one is to improve our share performance and get back to a position where we're actually holding our share of the U.S. beer industry. And while we do that, continue to premiumize the portfolio.","So those, for the foreseeable future, are the two priorities. When we tick those boxes, and particularly holding our share, then we can start to talk about a timeline for getting to flat volume. But we'll stay very focused on improving our share trajectory and premiumizing the portfolio, certainly, as we go into 2019 and probably into 2020 as well.","Operator","The next question will be from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Laurent Grandet - Guggenheim Partners","Yes. Good morning, everyone.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Good morning.","Laurent Grandet - Guggenheim Partners","Hey. And just building on the previous question, so I know you are not providing sales guidance anymore, but as by your calculation, 1% volume drop is worth about $60 million of hit to your free cash flow. I mean, it is important for us I mean to get some directions in the U.S. and Canada, for example, where sales has been soft for quite some time. What are you planning for the beer and SMB (56:08) categories of share gains?","And more specifically, it was long awaited, I mean, having a Mexican beer in your portfolio. It looks like Sol had been slow in terms of gaining ACV. I mean, I know (56:24) is partially right, but I mean you only get 23% ACV just almost for nine months where actually your major competitor reached above 80% (56:37) in six months. So could you please give us a bit more kind of granularity into the direction of where we should be thinking about sales growth or sales, and Sol specifically? Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","So, Laurent, on your first point, rather than get into a discussion on the call, can I suggest you take that up with Mark and Kevin afterwards? Because I'm not sure your math actually makes sense. So I think it's probably best to do that on a one-on-one and just get into the detail there, so we can understand how you arrived at that number.","But in terms of a deleverage in our free cash flow, we again have reiterated our guidance there. And as an executive team, we're very clear on our requirement to and our commitment to deliver on that free cash flow number. And we've done this consistently in our business over the last multiple number of years. So even when volumes have been stronger or volumes have been weaker, we have a great ability to drive the cash flow generating ability of our business.","So, I mean, that's all I would say on that. We know where we want to be in deleverage, we know the cash requirements and we are going to deliver on that.","On Sol, Gavin, why don't you pick up on Sol and just the progress that's been made as the team have repositioned that and the strength of the brand at retail?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Mark. Look, I mean, we're actually very pleased with the performance of Sol. We have only had the brand for \u2013 I mean we've had it for less than a year, and we've only been marketing behind it for six months. We've grown tremendous distribution in chain. Our chain team has done a fantastic job of building distribution, which just wasn't there before. We've got triple-digit growth in volume, and that's in the face of taking quite a substantial price increase on Sol. And revenue is growing at about 300% per Nielsen, volume is growing at about 200%. So we think we've got off to a really good start, and we think the brand's got great potential based on its provenance, its heritage, and its positioning. We brought a lot of investments and focus to the brand this year. We intend to step it up next year. We're going to have PACC extensions, and we're going to introduce the Sol (58:47). So we think the upside for this brand is strong, and we're very pleased with the start.","Laurent Grandet - Guggenheim Partners","Yes. And just on your comment on Nielsen. I mean, is it right to think that, I mean the ACV number is in the 23%, 25% range?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yep. That will be about right, yes.","Laurent Grandet - Guggenheim Partners","Okay. Thank you.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Okay. Thanks, Laurent.","Operator","The next question will be from Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Please go ahead.","Pablo Zuanic - SIG","Thank you. Just one question for Gavin. Gavin, I want to, I guess, challenge a little bit the notion that the problem with Coors Light, it is really just about the brand message. I would argue that the Bud Light message hasn't necessarily improved much. And Miller Lite has a consistent advertising message, but I can't say it's so differentiated either. So if we explore that, can you talk about, for example, does Coors Light and Miller Lite, how differently are they managed internally, whether in terms of spending, whether in terms of salespeople? Obviously, there is overlap to some extent on the distribution side, but it would help to understand that better. Or is it about a competitive issue?","These brands, although they are national, they do have big differences in terms of regional coverage. Is Coors Light more exposed to the growth of craft than Miller Lite? I mean it just seems to me that the big gap in performance within one brand and the other, I wonder if it's just about the brand message?","And the last question related to all that topic, if it's true that it's still a regional brand and I understand the industry is saturated to some extent, does Coors Light still have ACV opportunities, whether on-premise or off-premise? Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Gavin, do you want to get into that? It's going to be challenging to cover all of the questions.","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, there were a lot of points in there, Mark. But let me just try and give it a quick bash, right? So from a marketing point of view, we do have two separate teams. There's a Coors family of brand team, and a Miller family of brand team. We put a substantial amount of marketing and sales money behind both of those brands. And Mark, gave you some kind of insights into the third quarter numbers. So both of those brands get large investment.","We have found where brand propositions are sharp and they're differentiated, they succeed. And I think you can say that Miller Lite has clearly succeeded in that. And where some of our brands have struggled, you'll see that the brand propositions are either soft or they're not communicated well. And we think that that's the challenge that Coors Light has faced.","There's no doubt that the American light lagers are facing a number of different challenges, but frankly, Pablo, the American consumer, it still represents more than 40% of beer sold in the United States. And that percentage doesn't even include other satiable (1:01:56) lagers like the Mexican imports that are similar in style. So we think that there's a lot of volume out there for us. We think by sharpening up and focusing on Coors Light, that we can turn this brand around and perform at the same level as Miller Lite, if not better. And that's our job, and that's what we're focused on.","Pablo Zuanic - SIG","Okay.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Gavin, the other thing I would add to that, I mean, let's say (1:02:21) if you go back to Q1 2017, so if you go back four or five quarters, both Coors Light and Miller Lite were performing at down kind of 1%, 1.5%, so. And that was very consistent right through 2016. The Coors Light dramatization of its positioning was changed at that point, and it hasn't had the impact that we anticipated. We were looking to actually accelerate the performance, and we've seen a deceleration. So we have to put our hands up and say that work wasn't good enough, and we think we know why, and changes are currently being made and we'll be hitting the ground running as we go into 2019 on that. But we've been there before, Pablo, and we've made it work and we believe that we can continue to make it work.","And I think as the U.S. consumer continues to look for what we call active lifestyle brands, Miller Lite is the original active lifestyle brand. That's what it was built on when it was first launched, and it's been a big part of what Coors Light stands for as well. And we believe that there is a very real and significant role for these brands and consumer repertoires. But the job of our marketing team is to get the dramatization of our positioning compelling and motivating, and it's not been good enough and we have to fix it.","Operator","The next question will come from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hey, guys. Quick one for me on the U.S., and we have seen main stream beers decelerate over the last 18 months. So I was wondering if you could share with us what insights you have into where those consumers are going? And, I guess, a couple of points on that is, is it a brand-specific issue? Is it a bigger segment issue? And then if that deceleration in trend is actually occurring, does it mandate a more dramatic change for Molson Coors with respect to your strategy on portfolio transformation? Thanks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Hi, Brett. Let me start with your last point first, and then, Gavin do you want to just talk about trends in the U.S.?","I mean we've laid out a very clear strategy about \u2013 and in simple terms, it's about really defending the segment share that we have of our large core or national champion brands. We are doing that very successfully in many, many markets around the world, while at the same time premiumizing our portfolio. I think as I mentioned earlier that we want to accelerate the pace at which we premiumize the portfolio in the U.S.","We've made a couple of significant moves in the last 12 months with our introduction into the tea segment and our introduction into the Mexican import segment. I mean, Gavin and I and our team continue to look for further opportunities to strengthen that above premium portfolio. We feel we've got currently a great suite of brands and we're seeing very strong growth across a number of those above premium brands.","So, I think the strategy is clear. The pace at which we execute and how we can accelerate that strategy is really the question as opposed to whether there's a different strategy required. And where we've deployed that successfully in the UK and more broadly in Europe is really paying dividends for us, which is why Simon never gets any questions on these calls, because it's working so well.","But, Gavin, do you want to talk more specifically about some of the trends around mainstream brands in the U.S.?","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","From an industry point of view, Brett, obviously we saw continued share growth in above premium, and that was led by super premium imports and FMBs with sparkling seltzers, in particular seeing the greatest acceleration in share growth, and that's behind the whole hard seltzer category.","Craft share held pretty flat to the second quarter, and as you know, it's been declining for \u2013 or its growth has been declining for quite some time. And the industry premium large and economy segments, those losses accelerated compared to the previous quarter. And premium regular remained fairly similar.","So from an overall perspective, that's where the industry is, and I think Mark touched quite nicely on the strong offerings which we have got to tackle those challenges. I think the only one you didn't mention, Mark, was Peroni, which is the fastest growing European import at the moment. And we're going to invest meaningfully behind that brand next year with its first national advertising campaign.","Operator","The final question on our call today is a follow-up question, and that's from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you. I was wondering if you could kind of address a little bit here, the strategy on the economy brands. There's been a bit of give and take in terms of what you did with Keystone and then your major competitor came back, and I'm just wondering if kind of in retrospect whether you would have made those moves on Keystone again? It just seems a little bit of \u2013 I don't want to say race to the bottom, but I'm not sure how additive it is at the end of the day. So love to get your perspective on economy brand strategy.","Gavin D.K. Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Do you want to take that, Mark?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, so, I mean, Robert, there's a huge role for economy brands. I mean, they've got a tremendously loyal consumer base. The consumers want to see value and we think we've got great brands in this segment. And would we do the Keystone again? Of course, we would. It's been enormously successful for us and we're very pleased with its performance.","And, of course, we anticipated and expected our largest competitor to react to that, and they did. And they have gained some market share in the more-recent Nielsen reads, but we're very pleased with Keystone. We're pleased with Miller High Life and our marketing will continue to focus on the quality of that beer and the glass bottle and unique heritage.","Hamm's has been around for almost 150 years and that repositioning has worked well and then of course we've got the Steel Reserve Alloy Series, which provides tremendous value for our retailers and for our distributors. And we're growing quite nicely there and have fended off the competitive challenges that have come in that space.","So, yes. I think I would do most of it again. Obviously, we made some missteps with Milwaukee's Best and Icehouse and we fixed those during the course of this year and we will see the benefit of that going forward into next year.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","And is the \u2013 to just kind of to follow up on that, is the price gap between economy and mainstream where it needs to be in your view? And also, vis-\u00e0-vis kind of the lower-priced spirits that have taken share in previous years?","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Yeah, a few questions there. I mean, obviously, that's a fairly-broad generalization, Robert. So, the answer is yes and no. In many parts of the market, it is; and in some parts of the market, it isn't. We, obviously, evaluate the impacts of our decisions on other segments of the portfolio, and I would tell you we continue to gain segment share in premium light. So, we keep a very close watch on it.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Hunter for any closing remarks.","Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.","Thanks, Chad, and thanks, everybody, for your questions and your interest in our company. I thought it would be useful at this stage just to give you a couple of headlines because we've just hit the second anniversary of the close of the MillerCoors acquisition. So, it's really two years since we almost doubled the size of our company from both an EBITDA and a free cash flow perspective, and I just want to reiterate the commitments we made and the progress we're making against that.","So we remain clearly very committed to deleveraging and strengthening our balance sheet, and we're making very good progress against that commitment. We're overdelivering on our synergy and cost savings commitment, and that's against a tougher inflationary environment. We remain committed to our medium-term EBITDA margin guidance, and we're committed to revisit our dividend policy once deleverage is well-underway and we have done this.","And in the context of our commercial performance, we're committed to make MCI a meaningful EBITDA contributor, and we're doing this. We're committed to turn MCC, it's our Canadian business, around from a profit performance, and we're starting to see improvement stick. And we're committed to maintain the momentum in our Europe business, and we're doing this.","We're also committed to improve the commercial performance of the U.S. business, and this is still work-in progress. We've seen good progress in the value segment, good progress in Miller Lite, encouraging progress with our above premium innovations, but we're still dissatisfied on Coors Light and the pace of premiumization, and I expect to see those things improve and accelerate as we go into 2019.","And we also committed through our enterprise growth team to broaden the revenue growth drivers for MCBC and we're doing this through, for example, our cannabis JV with Truss and our entry into brewed beverages with, for example, Clearly Kombucha.","The two years on, I'm pleased with progress of our business and I'm excited about the work we still have ahead of us. So, I thought it would be good just to kind of summarize on our second anniversary virtually of that closing the MillerCoors transaction, about the progress within our business, and really appreciate your interest in our company and look forward to the follow ups that Mark and Gavin will pick up with you through the balance of the day. But thanks everybody, and look forward to catching up with you in due course.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors.","Mark Hunter","Thank you, Phil, and hello and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call, and many thanks for joining today. With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have Tracey Joubert, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, the COO of our U.S. business; Fred Landtmeters, our Canada CEO; Simon Cox, the CEO of our Europe business; Sergey Yeskov, our new International CEO; who earlier this year moved over from leading our commercial teams in Canada; Lee Reichert, our incoming Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, the Global VP of Investor Relations.","Now before diving into results, I wanted to take a moment to publicly recognize a couple of people. Firstly, Sam Walker, who's led our legal and corporate affairs team and has been on our executive team for almost 13 years; Sam is retiring from our business at the end of this month to pursue an exciting opportunity in the public service sector in Colorado. For me personally, three enormous change; Sam has been a trusted adviser, good friend, and a constant champion for our Company and everything it stands and strives for. These are big shoes to fill in, and we're delighted to have Lee Reichert ready to step into this important role next month.","Secondly, I want to recognize Dave Dunnewald, our Investors Relations VP; who has announced he will retire in the first half of this year. Dave celebrates 35 years' service this year and started when our beers were only sold in 18 Western states. For the last 26 year, Dave has led our IR efforts; he has led 113 quarters of earnings calls and has seen our enterprise value grow from less than $1 billion to almost $30 billion. Well done, Dave, and thank you. And best wishes to you as you step into your next chapter.","So back to business; and today, Tracey and I will take you through our path to drive long-term total shareholder returns, highlighting fourth quarter and full year 2017 results and discuss our outlook for the business. We're also offering slides to show results on Investors Relations page of our website.","2017 marked the first full year of the bigger, stronger Molson Coors, and our full year results demonstrated balance and progress against both, our bottom line and top line growth. Integration, synergies and cost savings were all delivered on or ahead of plan by engaged employees around the world to align buying their First Choice for consumer and customer ambition. Our primary focus remained on driving margin expansion and bottom line growth with emphasis on productivity and cost savings, efficient commercial investments, and deleverage to maintain our investment grade debt ratings.","Secondly, we remain focused on delivering an improved top line through our commercial excellence approach, which provides a more sustainable source of profit growth over the medium to longer term. Capital allocation within our business continues to be guided by our Profit After Capital Charge or PACC approach as we seek to deliver total shareholder returns. ","For the full year versus pro forma results a year ago, we over-delivered on cost savings and free cash flow and optimized commercial spending, delivering a very strong net income growth, underlying EBITDA margin expansion of 77 basis points and underlying EBITDA growth of 3.7%. We also strengthened our balance sheet by more than $900 million through debt pay down and pension contribution as part of our deleveraging strategy. This was complemented by an improving top line with global brand volume growth of 1% and net sales per hectoliter growth of 2.6%, driven by enhanced revenue management and portfolio premiumization. We also grew market share in Canada and Europe for the year and delivered positive underlying EBITDA in our International business.","Across our business, we continue to focus on portfolio premiumization. Above Premium brand volumes increased 6% in the quarter and 21% for the year, with the full year benefiting from the added Miller international volumes. This Above Premium performance also benefited from strong growth across our global craft portfolio. With this strong growth, Above Premium now represents 20% of our total annual brand volumes. Importantly, we also delivered more than $1.4 billion of underlying free cash flow, as all part of the business drove cash execution and efficiency throughout the year.","So if we take a step back from the quarter and the year, our track record over the last few years reflects consistency and earning more, using less and investing wisely. Our enterprise and regional teams have earned more by energizing our core Above Premium and craft portfolio through existing brands, as well as successful bolt-on acquisitions, with Apple Cider in the U.K. being the most recent addition to our portfolio. We're using less by over-delivering on cost savings and as our lower cost to achieve, which is in part driven by closing two breweries in Europe and one in the U.S.; and we've continued to invest wisely with strong free cash flow generation and deleveraged focus. Later this year, we plan to update you regarding how we expect our approach to capital allocation to evolve as we approach our deleverage targets.","I personally am very proud of our achievement in 2017 against the backdrop of complex structural and brand portfolio integration. Highly engaged teams across geographies and functions have executed with brilliance and stayed focused on our First Choice ambition and financial goals. Our integration work streams delivered foundational work to drive future productivity and savings, and our commercial team strengthened their brand portfolio and our customer relationships, which will be key to our success as we play to win every day.","And now let me turn the call over to Tracey to give you financial highlights. Tracey?","Tracey Joubert","Thank you, Mark, and hello, everyone. Let's review our consolidated financial headlines for the fourth quarter versus pro forma results a year ago except for cash flow which is reported on a full year actual basis. Also, keep in mind that in the fourth quarter of 2017, we changed our method of calculating pension plan assets used to determine our net periodic pension costs, which favorably impacted our Canada, Europe and consolidated results. ","Net sales increased 4.5% due to positive global pricing, royalty revenue, favorable foreign currency movements and starting [ph] a $50 million indirect tax provision from a year ago, partially offset by lower financial volume. Net sales in constant currency grew 2.4%. Net sales per hectoliter increased 5.8% and 3.7% in constant currency. Worldwide brand volume decreased 1.1% due to lower volume in the U.S. and international, partially offset by growth in Europe and Canada. Global priority brand volume decreased 1.9%, and financial volumes decreased 1.2%, driven by the U.S.","Our U.S. GAAP net income increased from a loss last year to income of $588 million this year; this improvement was primarily due to a discrete tax benefit related to that revaluation of our deferred tax balances which resulted from the recent U.S. tax reform along with favorable underlying performance in stocking and impairment charge for the Molson brands in Canada and an indirect tax provision in Europe reported a year ago. Underlying EBITDA increased 17% on a reported basis and increased 14.3% on a constant currency basis. This strong underlying performance was driven by positive pricing, cost savings and MG&A efficiencies, partially offset by the impact of lower volumes, inflation and investments behind our global business capabilities. Results also benefited from indirect tax provision a year ago and higher net pension benefits. Underlying EBITDA margins improved 198 basis points during the quarter.","Looking at the full year; net debt of $10.9 billion was more than $600 million lower than at the beginning of the year, despite $280 million of unfavorable foreign currency movements. We also made more than $300 million of contribution to our defined benefit pension plan as part of our overall pension derisking strategy and deleveraging goals. Underlying free cash flow of $1.4 billion was up 68% from actual results last year. The prior guidance was driven by benefits from timing of working capital at the end of the year, as well as capital expenditure reduction. In the past several years, we had made substantial progress in improving the efficiency of our balance sheet to help generate cash and drive higher cash returns on our assets. As seen on this slide, we have a consistent track record of improving working capital as a percentage of sales in each of the past 6 years, and we have more progress to make in the years ahead.","For the full year, we improved underlying EBITDA by 4.3% in constant currency with underlying EBITDA margin expansion of 77 basis points for the year. Our top line for the year also benefited from strong net sales per hectoliter growth and total worldwide brand volume up 1%. Now I'd like to share some regional highlights.","In the U.S., we grew underlying EBITDA 4.9% in the fourth quarter versus pro forma results last year, driven by higher net pricing, cost savings and lower MG&A expenses, partially offset by cost inflation and lower shipment volume. Overall, U.S. STRs declined 3% for the quarter, and domestic sales to wholesalers declined 1.5%. This quarter marked the 13th consecutive quarter of increased signatory [ph] of Miller Lite elevating the brand to the number 3 beer in America according to Nielsen. Coors Light remains the number 2 beer and completed its 11th consecutive quarter of increased segment share. Our Below Premium brand portfolio was down low-single digits and achieved its best quarterly trend since the third quarter of 2009. We also gained share of segment and industry with our Below Premium brand in the quarter through Nielsen led by the Keystone family. ","Our full year U.S. underlying EBITDA increased 2.7% versus pro forma results last year, driven by 1% increase in domestic net sales per hectoliter, cost savings and lower MG&A expenses, partially offset by cost inflation and a 2.9% decrease in domestic STR volumes. For the year, we gained market share within the Premium Light and Premium Regular segments as Coors Banquet completed its 11th consecutive year of growth. And in the Above Premium, Blue Moon Belgian White grew during each quarter and continued to acquire incremental [indiscernible]. Leinenkugel's was up low-single digits for the year, propelled by Summer Shandy's best volume year in the brand's history.","For the year, we also held share within the Below Premium segment which was one of our 2017 goals. Our Canada underlying EBITDA declined 4.2% in the fourth quarter on a reported basis and 8.4% on a constant currency basis, driven by inflation and higher distribution cost, partially offset by positive pricing, lower MG&A expenses and favorable foreign currency. Our brand volumes increased 0.8%, and market share during the quarter was consistent with the prior year with share gains in the Above Premium segment. We also drove the top line with 1% net sales per hectoliter growth in constant currency during the quarter.","One meaningful portfolio highlight in the premium segment was flat volume on an absolute basis during the quarter. While this benefited from incremental Miller Lite volume, our two biggest brands reflected sequential improvements compared to earlier in the year. Full year results benefited from improving trends in the fourth quarter, however, full year brand volumes declined 0.5% and underlying EBITDA declined 11.6% in constant currency.","Full year net sales for per hectoliter grew 2.2% in local currency, reflecting positive net pricing and mix. Our Europe team continues to grow both at the bottom and top line. Fourth quarter underlying EBITDA grew 239.5% in constant currency, driven by higher volumes, positive sales mix and increased net pension benefit, as well as the benefit of cycling indirect tax provision a year ago. Brand volume increased 10.4% in the quarter, primarily due to the addition of Miller brands and the transfer of royalty and export brand volumes across Europe from our International business. But even without the incremental volume, we continue to achieve growth from our core and Above Premium brands which helped drive net sales per hectoliter growth.","For the full year, underlying EBITDA grew strongly, driven by volume growth, positive sales mix and higher net pension benefit, along with cycling the indirect tax provision that was booked in the fourth quarter of 2016 and reversed in the first quarter of 2017. We also grew net sales per hectoliter, as well as our market share as brand volumes increased 10.3% in Europe.","For our International business, underlying EBITDA was at $0.4 million in the quarter, a $1 million decrease from a year ago, driven by the loss of the Modelo contract in Japan, the transfer of royalty and export brand volume to Europe and high MG&A from the addition of the Miller International business. This was partially offset by the addition of Puerto Rico and volume growth across several Latin American markets. While we were able to grow organic volumes in existing markets, total brand volume decreased 15.1% in the quarter. Reported net sales per hectoliter increased 6.1% due to the favorable sales mix and positive pricing.","International full year 2017 underlying EBITDA of $3.5 million represented a $7 million improvement from a loss a year ago. Underlying gross profit increased more than 50% to $87.1 million, which exceeded prior guidance as our Caribbean team was able to mitigate some of the anticipated hurricane impacts. International brand volumes were up 28.9%, and reported net sales per hectoliter increased 0.8%.","While our earnings release provides more detail, I want to spend a moment to share the following financial highlights for 2018. Underlying free cash flow of $1.5 billion, plus or minus 10%, which excludes the recently disclosed $330 million cash proceeds related to resolving a purchase price adjustment. As I mentioned earlier, 2018 free cash flow will be tracking some timing of working capital benefits in 2017. Cost savings guidance of $210 million in 2018 is part of our newly increased 3-year savings target of $600 million, up from our previous target of $550 million for 2017 to 2019; this represents an acceleration of the related cost savings into years 1 and 2 of the 3-year program. We now also estimate that our cost to catch-up synergies for the program will be $250 million, down from $350 million previously due to efficiencies in both, capital spending and non-core operating expenses.","Delivering on the savings commitments will be particularly important this year given recent increases in input costs such as aluminum and fuel. We currently anticipate an inflation headwind across our company in 2018 that is more than $50 million larger than in 2017, driven by aluminum, diesel fuel and other factors.","Please see our earning release this morning for specific cost of goods raised guidance by business unit for 2018. Our cost savings remains a way of life at Molson Coors, and as we have previously committed, we will deliver on the current 3-year cost savings program for 2017 through 2019 which we have just increased to $600 million. We are in the process of developing our next 3-year savings program which will be for 2020 through 2022, and we plan to offer details in the first half of 2019.","Following the enactment of U.S. tax reform, we anticipate approximately $200 million of transaction-related cash tax benefits in 2018 and substantial benefits in the 13 years after this year as seen in this slide. Beyond this, we expect additional cash tax benefits from tax reform, primarily related to lower corporate income tax rate and accelerated depreciation of qualified assets for tax. Additionally, following the enactment of U.S. tax reform, we expect an underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22% in 2018. This rate is 6 to 8 percentage points lower than prior to tax reform and reflects a substantial benefit to offset tax underlying income and earnings per share for our shareholders. We currently expect a long-term effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 24%.","Please keep in mind, additional definitive guidance from the U.S. government regarding implementation of the recently passed tax reform legislation could impact this outlook. It is also important to highlight that our 2018 results will be impacted by $850 million of underlying depreciation and amortization, which represents an approximate $50 million increase from 2017. This increase is driven primarily by information system and investments in the U.S., including in our order systems, which will make it easier for our customers to do business with us.","Additionally, 2018 results will be impacted by the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, and pension and OPEB accounting guidance, as well as changes to segment reporting related to pension and other post-retirement benefit costs. With these changes in pension accounting, we expect $46 million of Europe pension income in 2017 to move to our corporate results. The new revenue recognition accounting standard became effective for us at the beginning of 2018 and prior year's results will not be restated. Along with some timing change, we currently anticipate that this change will reduce both, net sales and MG&A expenses by approximately $70 million to $90 million during 2018, primarily within our Canada segment, with no significant impact on net income. The impacts of these accounting changes are discussed in further detail with Input Note 2 of our 2017 Form 10-K.","Consistent with last year, our focus in 2018 will be ensuring that our business generates strong cash flow as we strengthen our balance sheet and deliver cost savings while increasing our EBITDA margins over the next 3 to 4 years. As Mark mentioned, we tend to revisit our 3 baskets of capital allocation priorities later this year which include returning cash to shareholders, strengthening our balance sheet and growth opportunities such as M&A and brand investments. But in the near-term, we will focus further on strengthening our balance sheet while maintaining our annual dividends.","And at this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Tracey. I'll begin the call today by outlining our plans to drive total shareholder returns. Going forward, we believe our ambition to be First Choice of our consumers and customers will be central to our bottom and top line success. Our regional business priorities are clear and consistent.","In the U.S. 2017 industry dynamics were challenging, our teams continue to be disciplined, decisive and accountable as we continue to deliver long-term profit growth. We've grown underlying EBITDA in the U.S. substantially since 2009 including in difficult trading conditions. And this year, exemplified that ability as we grew underlying EBITDA 4.9% in the quarter from 2.7% for the full year. We know we have the brands, the plants and the teams to achieve our goals, which includes our growth agenda. Our objective for flat volumes by 2018 and growth by 2019 remains our strategic comparator. While we're not driving for growth at any cost we will strengthen and expand our portfolio, drive investment efficiency through ROMI, or return on marketing investment, and also through global procurement and the use of PACC, and will continue to earn category captainships underpinned by tools such as Building with Beer as these are all steps to help us and our partner to sell more beer, more profitably.","Within our brand portfolio, we'll continue to gain segment share in premium, grow in Above Premium and continue to stabilize our Below Premium brand volume. We'll refresh Coors Light packaging and release new creative over the next couple of months while continuing to build momentum buying Miller Lite, the original light beer. Within Above Premium, we'll accelerate our performance by building on solid growth in 2017 from our two national craft brands, Blue Moon Belgian White and Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy, as well as the strong growth of our regional brands including Terrapin, Hop Valley, Revolver, Saint Archer and Colorado Native.","Additionally, excitement from our distributor and chain partners for our 2018 innovation lineup is also apparent with tens of thousands of incremental placements already committed. This whole brand will be launched in April with redesign packaging supported by an integrated marketing campaign. Alongside Peroni [ph], which is also accelerating, we will have a strong one-two punch in the import segment. Additionally, and just a past few weeks we've brought to retail Arnold Palmer Spiked [ph], designed to take share in the valuable hard tea segment and Two Hats positioned to bring new legal age drinkers into beer.","In Canada, our teams are building on improved 2017 momentum. Our consumer excellence teams will continue to focus on gaining segment share in premium, accelerating our growth in Above Premium and craft and stabilizing our Below Premium brand share. Our number 1 priority for our brands remains on improving the performance of Coors Light and Molson Canadian by refocused marketing, improved customer promotions and stronger commercial execution. Above Premium performance will be driven by Coors Banquet, MGD, Belgian Moon and the Heineken portfolio.","In addition to listing and shifting Miller highlights to Canada, we will introduce two further brands from our U.S. portfolio to broaden and deepen our Canadian portfolio later this year. And we're also going out to incremental drinking locations by launching some great tasting innovation in the non-alcohol segment in 2018, with more details to follow in due course. In the customer excellence front, we'll continue to rollout proven best practice tools such as building with beer, and alongside this commercial excellence continues to focus on sales productivity, customer 360 initiatives, and joint business planning resulting in strong and market impact.","Supply chain themes in Canada continue with brewery optimization efforts and productivity improvements as we're just over a year from opening our new British Columbia brewery, and the new Montr\u00e9al brewery is expected to begin production in 2021.","In Europe, the environment remains competitive, we'll continue to use our balanced portfolio approach, drive disciplined retail execution and optimize our brewery network. In 2018, there are a few headwinds that are important to remember when modeling the results for our Europe business. In the first quarter, we will be cycling the $30 million indirect tax provision benefit from 2017. In addition, throughout 2018 we will increase investment behind our brands and commercial priorities to further strengthen our First Choice agenda. And lastly, as Tracey highlighted, as a result of the changes in pension accounting we expect $46 million of Europe pension income in 2017 to move to corporate results.","Our commercial teams will build on our positive momentum this year by strengthening our national mainstream brands, including Carling, our largest brand in Europe, which further strengthens its overall number 1 position in the U.K. beer market in 2017. For our Above Premium portfolio, 2017's double-digit sales growth reflects the fact that Ice Cold Rocky Mountain refreshment is resonating powerfully with Coors Light consumers in the U.K. and Ireland. Above Premium Staropramen, outside of its domestic market has grown at double-digit rates, and we continue to push the brand into new markets with a check Providence and quality can deliver growth in the Above Premium segments.","To accelerate our growth in craft, led by Sharps and Franciscan Well, we've added [indiscernible] brands to our portfolio and with Cider we're building on strong growth by Carling Cider and Rekorderlig with the 2018 acquisition of Asphalt [ph], a growing Cider brand founded in 1720 with a distinct face, place and story that supports our premiumization strategy. Our balanced portfolio approach also relies in continuing commitment to deliver against our focus to become the first choice for customers. We maintained our number 1 supplier ranking in the U.K. advantage retail survey for the multiple grosser off-premise channel, and also recently achieved a number 1 ranking in the multiple on-premise channel for the first time.","With integration of that Miller International business largely complete and with nearly 4.4 million hectoliters of total brand volume in 2017, our International business has increased substantially over the past year and is now more than half as big as our Canada business from our volume perspective. We'll continue to utilize an asset-light model in select markets and our efforts will focus on global priority brands, Coors Light, the Miller trademark and Blue Moon. Coors Light maintains strong growth in Latin America last year, and in Mexico passed 1 million hectoliters of brand volume, making it the fourth largest Coors Light market globally. We're currently launching the Miller Lite original white can packaging to more than 20 markets globally, and while still early days, results for this authentic packaging are very positive.","Across Molson Coors against a backdrop of integration and challenging market conditions during 2017, we delivered financial and commercial results that demonstrate our balance priorities for bottom and top line growth are working. In 2018, our First Choice focus across regions will continue to strengthen and premiumize our brand portfolio while also deepening our customer relationships. We'll also continue to retain flexibility in our P&L, delivering on our cost savings and remained laser focused in delivering against our cash targets and strengthening our balance sheet.","Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. As usual our prepared remarks and slides will be in our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Dave Dunnewald and Kevin Kim will be available via telephone or email to assess with any additional questions you may have regarding our quarterly results.","With this point, Phil, we'd like to open up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Andrea Teixeira","I wanted to just cycle back to the synergies and the reinvestment; you had an amazing quarter in terms of flow-through, and it was above what you had initially indicated at the Analyst Day. I was just hoping to see how we should be seeing the cadence for 2018 and if this margin was just a catch-up because, obviously, the first 9 months you had a more challenging environment and you had to defend it. So for the full year, you used to had it like within that guidance. So is there anything that has changed, that made -- I mean, obviously, you had $80 million more than you originally anticipated, but how we should be thinking about the range that you gave us at the in terms of for investment? And how we would layer that through your initial thought about stabilizing volumes in the U.S. in 2018? How should we be thinking of that goal going forward as you have more visibility?","Mark Hunter","There's quite a lot in there so let me try to answer. If you look at our overall cost savings and synergies, we cleared out very clearly our 3-year exploration, and that transformation was one that had increased following the initial synergy assumption. So we increased synergies, and we accelerated those to get us the $550 million over 3 years. We've now increased that number from $550 million to $600 million. And we've made very good progress in year 1. We actually managed to accelerate some of the savings from years 3 and 2 and to year 1, which was very encouraging. That was important because as we came through 2017, some of the inflation assumptions were actually more negative than we'd anticipated, particularly around aluminum and fuel. So it was important that we over-delivered. And there's no real change that we that we think about allocation of savings within our business.","Clearly, we're not going to give a formula because it's important that we retain flexibility to use those cost savings as we see appropriate. But obviously, the offset inflation, which was driven principally through commodities, any volume deleverage we're seeing. We're also using some of those cost savings to focus on our global growth and efficiency initiatives. So we set up the next cycle cost savings in our business and things like global shared services and supply chain infrastructure changes are taking place in Canada as a couple of examples, and then a proportion flows through to the bottom line. So that's the way that we tend to look at our cost savings. And alongside those, obviously, as we intimated, we continued to retain flexibility in terms of our overall MG&A to ensure that we deliver EBITDA margin expansion the bottom line improvements.","I think the second part of your question, related to the U.S. and I think Gavin and I have been very clear that stabilizing our volume in the U.S. is a strategic imperative ahead of moving into absolute growth that the business and volume terms have declined for the best part of 10 years. Our intent is still to deliver this on 2018. If industry volumes are softer than anticipated, it may take a lot longer to get there but it doesn't change this strategic imperative. And we'll make sure we do that in a manner that allows us to grow even though margins and overall EBITDA. In other words, we're not chasing stabilization and growth at any cost, but growth in a measured and balanced way I think the team demonstrated our ability to do that if you look at our EBITDA performance in the U.S. in the fourth quarter and on a full year basis.","Andrea Teixeira","So the margins that we saw in the fourth quarter there, you see as real, a real improvement over time in the cadence of the synergies? You saw more synergies heading into the fourth quarter? Or they were pretty much balanced throughout the quarters?","Mark Hunter","There were reasonably balanced. And I think what we've said is we're not going to update on a quarterly basis on cost savings and synergies. We'll do that on a full year basis, and we've now giving you an updated guidance and expanded our cost savings aspiration. The thing to bear in mind is, I think, in 2017, inflation giving about $60 million to $65 million ahead of what we anticipated, and we think inflation will grow by about another $50 million as we go into 2018.","Andrea Teixeira","And that's on a global basis, I'm assuming, that number?","Mark Hunter","That's on a global basis, that's correct. And we also mentioned as well in our guidance, we'll be cycling the benefit direct tax provision reversal in 2017 of -- Q1 of 2017. So there's a few puts and takes as you think about 2018. The improvement and solid financial performance of our business is very real for sure.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Stephen Powers","So maybe to build on Andrea's question a little bit, I think we're all impressed with a strong profit and cash performance exiting '17, the raise having objective to better than expected free cash flow for '18. I guess my first question is a bit more detail on where you are sourcing that cast productivity outside from. It sounds like working capital timing played a role. But I'd love also some more color on what drove the decision to spend a bit less than expected on CapEx. And any more color on marketing promotional investment trends that you may be able to offer, that'll be great.","Mark Hunter","You covered full sense of the P&L and balance sheet there, Steve. Tracey, do you want to pick up some perspective on Steve's question?","Tracey Joubert","Yes. So if we look at the free cash flow, which I think is the CapEx reporting to that as well. So the free cash flow remains a focus as we look to meet our deleverage commitment to the rating agencies. So when we look at the $1.5 billion, plus or minus 10%, guidance that we're giving for 2018, I think a couple of things to consider.","So firstly, we touch on the CapEx. So we actually started speaking about this towards the back half of last year was -- and as we were going through our cost savings and synergies, we found ways to actually spend less behind those initiatives but still continue to deliver the cost savings and synergies, and that spending less came primarily from the CapEx side; so we were able to reduce our CapEx guidance in 2017. And as well in 2018, we'll continue to deliver some CapEx reduction previously thought to be needed around synergies and cost savings through efficiencies and elimination of some projects, so that would not -- that's not timing, that's really efficiencies.","And then as we look at some of the other big drivers of the free cash flow, just to think about as you're modeling, the cash taxes will be a bit of a headwind in 2018. So just as a reminder, last year, we strengthened our balance sheet through making additional pension contribution of over $300 million. Our pension contribution regarding to in 2018 is $10 million but because of that contribution last year, we actually received a tax refund. This year, we will be paying cash taxes, so that's assuming that will be a bit of a headwind as well.","And then the timing of the working capital; we also just mentioned this in Q3 I believe -- what is difficult to really accurately forecast is mainly in our European business unit -- we cash collections at year-end timing is difficult because we have thousands of customers in different countries. And in 2017, at the end of 2017, we actually -- we had really strong cash collection at year-end so that's a little bit of a timing, also to consider as you look at our free cash flow, both 2017 and 2018. I hope that helps.","Mark Hunter","I think the other thing you mentioned was really around our MG&A spend, particularly the fourth quarter. I think again, we've been very consistent, we'll retain flexibility around our commercial investment, and we're working very hard across our business to drive commercial investment, productivity, principally through the ROMI model but just becomes stronger and stronger in the U.S. and rolled into Canada and it's rolled into the U.K. as well. So really making sure we're driving higher returns out of every existing dollar. And that's allowed us from the back of some of the procurement work we've done as well through get -- give us more flexibility in some of that marketing spend, and we're utilizing that in real time quarter-by-quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Vivien Azer, Cowen.","Vivien Azer","I wanted to circle back to the U.S. and get your assessment of some of the strategic moves that you made in 2017 and, in particular, some of the price investments that you made at the low end of the portfolio. Would love kind of a postmortem on how that played out relative to your expectations, in particular as it relates to brand interaction across kind of value or economy and Premium Lights?","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Vivien. Gavin, do you want to pick up specifically and everybody of the portfolio strategy across the 3 major segments and what was delivered in 2017?","Gavin Hattersley","Sure. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everybody. Vivien, the first thing that I would say is from a pricing point of view, actually our pricing was pretty similar, actually was slightly up in Q4 versus Q3, notwithstanding the success we've had with our economy strategy. And as Mark said, when we came into our flat by '18 growth, by '19 mantra [ph], 2 years ago we had three building blocks which we we're focusing on and economy was just one of them. We wanted to halt the decline rates in economy and we wanted to hold share; and as we headed out of the fourth quarter, actually we've done better on both of those dimensions, we've more than halved the decline and we actually grew share in the fourth quarter, Keystone played a part of that and so did Hams [ph].","Premium Lights was the second building block; and there we needed to gain share and obviously, our job in 2018 is to accelerate share. As Tracey said, we gained share of segment for both, Miller Lite and Coors Light in the fourth quarter for the 13th and 11th time, respectively. And then importantly, our Above Premium and as you talk about strategic building blocks, this is where we laid a strong foundation for '17 for action and execution in 2018, particularly around sold, which we're launching on the 1st of April and Arnold Palmer, which we spiked half-from-half which we launched a couple of weeks ago and then building on the growth of the 4 craft companies. And then we also launched Crispin Rose a couple of weeks ago, and that's off to a really solid start.","And at the same time, we turned around both Blue Moon and Leinenkugel's, which had a difficult 2016, and both of them grew strongly in 2017 as Mark or Tracey said. Does it cover it for you, Mark?","Mark Hunter","Yes, Gavin, that's clear. Vivien, the only thing I will add and I think it was behind your question; are there any unintended consequences of our focus on Below Premium, and that's something we are monitoring them carefully. We don't believe that the work we've done on Below Premium is having an impact on other parts of our portfolio. The economy drinkers are our Below Premium drinkers in the U.S. are very, very loyal; and our job is to ensure that we compete effectively in that segment for those loyal drinkers. And as we come into this year, we're also looking to ensure that LDA to 24 drinkers joined the beer category through introduction of our Two Hats brands.","So we're being very careful about the interaction between the segments and our pricing relativities. And I think we feel pretty good about the strategy and effectiveness of that strategy through 2017.","Operator","The next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Eunjoo Hong","So a question about the revenue per barrel performance in the U.S. So in the quarter, up 1.4%. If you could break down rate versus mix. And then as we think about 2018, you obviously called out some of the inflationary pressure you're seeing on the cost structure. So should we see a year where your revenue per unit is going to be below your cost per unit? Or is there sort of an attempt to get more pricing in the marketplace as the inflation is creeping up.","Mark Hunter","Okay. So Gavin, do you want to pick up on just on the construct of revenue per barrel in the U.S.? And then Tracey, do want to pick up on 2018 inflation, avoiding any guidance as per Judy's question? Gavin, over to you.","Gavin Hattersley","Judy, as you say, we generated 1.4% the fourth quarter, which was about 20 basis points higher than in the third quarter. If you break it out between sort of a net pricing, that was about 180 basis points, and mix was negative 40 basis points. And that negative mix was entirely associated with the packaged mix as it relates to some of our packaging strategies, primarily in Keystone Light. From an overall pricing point of view, I would just point out that 2017 pricing was actually slightly up over 2016 full year pricing, about 10 basis points. As for as 2018 outlook is concerned, Judy, as Mark said, we don't guide there.","Tracey Joubert","Yes. And then Judy, just in terms of the cost per hectoliter guidance for the U.S., so our guidance is to be up low single-digit for 2018. As Mark also mentioned, the inflation that we are expecting in 2018 is across Molson Coors. This will be more than $50 million higher than we what we saw in 2017.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore ISI.","Robert Ottenstein","Wondered if you could help us out, there's been a lot of kind of weird industry data that's come out -- that's making it a little bit hard to for us to discern what's going on; the beer institute, STWs down high-single digits in December. And then there's the IRI data is very positive for January; Nielsen, not so positive. Can you give us any -- and I think it's attested to what timing issue on the scanner data? But can you give us any sense either in terms of your own business or the industry in terms of what happened with the December shipments and what's going on in January, please?","Mark Hunter","Again, assuming your question is specific to U.S., I'll ask Gavin to talk through the detail. Just one thing to remember something from our performance perspective is that our underlying strategy is to shift to consumption. Clearly within our business, there's some pretty significant change initiative still rolling through. So what we call our VPNS or our combined ordering system, which is being going live and golden successfully over the course of the last couple of weeks. And there will be further initiatives on the VPNS initiative as we roll through 2018 and into Q1 2019. But Gavin, can you try and -- try to join the dots differences across the different sources of industry data for December? Is that possible to do?","Gavin Hattersley","That's really tough, Mark. I'm trying to draw a line between all of these different industry sources this quite difficult, Robert. I can tell about us. As Mark said, we said on the third quarter called that we're going to take shipments up a little bit or inventories up a little bit in the fourth quarter. So we did that. We took our inventories up by about a day, which is in line with what we said. And that would've positively impacted shipment volumes by about 120 basis points. So it explains most of the difference between the 3 and the 1.5. I mean, I really can't comment on why industry shipments down in December; that's probably a question you should direct at our competitors.","From a Nielsen and other market sources, our share remains pretty consistent with all of those sources. And I think we discontinued giving guidance on January some time ago so I'm not going to give any input into that.","Mark Hunter","The only thing I would add, Gavin and Robert, again if you take a step back, the U.S. industry, beer industry continues to be the largest global profitable in the margin to expand because even with volumes under a little bit of pressure continues to premiumize, so continues to be a great place to compete. And it's probably not something that we get too concerned about in terms of some of the short-term trends and volatility that we see in volume line.","Operator","The next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Credit Suisse.","Laurent Grandet","It has been a while since the stock has been that much up, I mean, during the course, so congrats on the good quarter. So I'd like to dig a bit more in term of the tax benefit and the cash redeployment. So the press release provides no information on how the company intends to reinvest tax savings. Could you please tell us how you're planning to redeploy coming from a better tax rate. Do you see a party to invest specifically Coors Light and also the new brands like Sol Arnold Palm [ph]?","Mark Hunter","Let me take the second question part of your question first, and Tracey can talk about the tax benefits and cash uses in our business. I mean, if you look at a horse our organization, our total marketing spend is close to our marketing spend is close to $1.5 billion. We spent close to $1 billion in the U.S. behind our brands. Their view is that we have the flexibility to support the development of our portfolio. So as we bring new brands in, we continue to drive productivity and efficiency in our commercial spend, and we'll invest a rate that we believe will drive the maximum return. That's through in the U.S., Canada and our European business, and I think we've demonstrated our ability to continue to make that happen.","So don't expect any kind of material increase or ballooning of commercial investments as we go into 2018. We'll be working our existing dollars very, very hard to drive further productivity and efficiency and impact improvements. Tracey, do you want to talk to tax benefit and cash deployment?","Tracey Joubert","Yes. So it's -- I look at the end guidance that we've given our transaction-related cash tax benefit. So we're guiding to approximately $200 million of cash tax benefit. Now that is down from what we had previously given before tax reform, and that's really driven by the reduction in the corporate tax rate. But overall, we are a net beneficiary of the tax reform. I'm not going to, at this stage, give you exactly what those details are, but you can see just from the underlying tax rate that we're now guiding to for 2018, which will be between 18% and 22%. That is significantly lower and will provide a net benefit for us. Just in terms of the uses of the tax benefits, as Mark said, our focus is really on deleveraging our business and strengthening our balance sheet.","So we will continue to generate free cash flow to pay down our debt and maintain our investment grade rating. And then as we said earlier, towards the back half of the year as we get closer to that deleverage targets, we will talk about capital allocations.","Operator","The next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets.","Amit Sharma","Mark, two questions, both on U.S. Understand your about price\/mix outlook for '18, but can you talk about industry price environment? If everybody is facing inflation, is there appetite within the industry to take adequate pricing? And then second, just on U.S. volumes, really good to see the discipline on investment and yet be able to grow EBITDA margins. Now if industry or let's say volume weak for the industry for the category, do we still have enough confidence that you continue to grow EBITDA margins with that weaker volume environment?","Mark Hunter","Okay. So Gavin, if you're just going to tune in here and if I miss anything, please share. Certainly, on the price\/mix piece, I'm going to comment on industry level. We're going to play our game that will drive our portfolio, and we'll continue to work very hard to ensure that we offer great value to consumers it's appropriate to our brand equity while premiumizing our overall portfolio. And that's consistent with the U.S., Canada and our European business, that's very central to our business. But I mean, overall, the U.S. volumes in your question around EBITDA margins, we are very clear about what our number 1 priority center business, which is to deliver on our EBITDA margin, development as per our guidance, improve our bottom line and generate strong free cash flow.","And then secondly, certainly, over the longer to medium term, really start to see improvement in our top line through strengthening and putting our portfolio and strengthening our customer relationships. I think specifically within the U.S., if you look at our EBITDA margins, they've improved sequentially and consistently over the last few years, and we believe now with the MillerCoors part of our of the bigger Molson Coors, there's further opportunities to enhance our EBITDA margins as North American supply chain shared services and the global procurement, which have all got to a great start in 2017 continue to pick up pace through 2018 and 2019.","So even against a tough industry environment, driving productivity in the business, and securing some of the benefits of integrating as part of Molson Coors still gives us headroom to continue to expand our EBITDA margins.","Gavin, I don't know whether I missed anything there or if any builds on that?","Gavin Hattersley","No, that was a very comprehensive, Mark. I have nothing to add.","Operator","The next question comes from Pablo Zuanic from SFG.","Pablo Zuanic","I have a two-part question on the synergies in 2017 and the outlook for 2018. And then maybe Mark and Tracey, you can show me if I'm doing the right thing in terms of evaluating the performance. The way I see it, your EBITDA for the year consolidated grew $100 million, right? On the synergies of $255 million, that looks good but U.S. EBITDA, up $50 million; Canada, down $24 million, is down $60 million in two years; our corporate expense is up $85 million; so to some extent, the numbers look good because of these big jump in Europe of around $170 million EBITDA for the year, which to me seems to be a one-off for anything accounting related. So if we strip out Europe, EBITDA for the year was down and little slow.","So what I'm saying is, when I look at the numbers for 2017, what jumps out as a positive to me is the jump of $50 million in EBITDA in the U.S. But on synergies of $255 million, that's still only 20% realization. Canada seems to be a problem. I don't know if Fred can comment on that margins that are down there for two years in a row? And Europe, the big jump seems to be one-off; so I don't think I can count on Europe growing EBITDA margin next year. Corporate expenses, basically your guidance seems to be flat. So if you can comment on that?","And then if I can allow a second question for Gavin in terms of our STRs, you know, this kind of data -- when I look at your STRs, down 3% for the quarter, it would be nice if you can break that down between the growth in Above Premium in the U.S., what I call mainstream and then value? And the reason I asked that is that you are -- the data seems to show that mainstream was down about 3%, whereas value was up about 3%, but mainstream is like 2.5 times the size of value. So if you can comment on that -- if there are any channel differences between those three products groups that may be -- made this kind of data being distorted? You can start with the cost question, first. Thank you.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Pablo. As usual, you've used your one\/two trick on questions; so we'll try and cover all of the basics here. On the first one, I don't think your analysis on EBITDA is accurate, I mean, our European business has delivered very, very solid top the bottom line performance, volume growth, pricing growth, good cost management and strong EBITDA performance, that was enhanced by the one-off tax provision. But if you strip that out, then we're still seeing very solid performance. And my perspective is our Europe business is kind of a poster side for what we're going to deliver across all of Molson Coors, which is just really solid improvement on our bottom line and a very balanced approach from a top line perspective across volume, premiumization and pricing. So I do think a lot of discredit from a European perspective.","I think in the U.S., despite a tough backdrop, we are in the process of turning around our overall volume and refining and reshaping the portfolio. And Gavin and his team did a superb job of improving overall EBITDA performance. And as I mentioned in my previous question, I believe there's still further runway to expand our EBITDA margins as MillerCoors is now part of our global organization. Canada, your comments are fair. I mean it's -- we're in the process of turning that business around, and I was very pleased with the performance as we came through the second half of 2017. I think we've given you some indications as to the strengthening of our top line. Our volume was solid. We're back into share growth. We've seen pricing improvements. And what we're trying to do is balanced delivery for the day, while at the same time setting up the productivity improvements so as we look to 2020 to 2022 cost savings programs as well.","So we're taking some of the cost savings and synergies, use them to offset inflation that was higher than anticipated, and we have been investing for the medium to long term in shared services, world-class supply chain, our commercial excellence capabilities. So my job is to get the balance between delivering for today, which I think we've done very successfully in 2017 while at the same time, setting the business up for the medium to long term. So I'm not sure I would agree -- actually, I am sure, I wouldn't agree with your analysis on our EBITDA performance.","On the STRs, Gavin, do you want to comment on just the relative performance of each of the kind of major segments within the U.S.?","Gavin Hattersley","Right. Sure, Mark. Without getting into specific detail by segment from a performance point of view, in Above Premium, which is where we're putting a lot of emphasis, we grew Blue Moon Belgian White, we grew our core partners and we grew Peroni very strongly. And as I said earlier on, we got a nice platform coming into 2018 with solid and Arnold Palmer and the ones I just mentioned. Our economy portfolio, probably heard of our best performance in 8 years, primarily driven by the success of Keystone Lite. And Mark correctly said that doing extensive analysis on the performance of Keystone Light, and it's having a no material impact on our mainstream brands. It under indexes in terms of going from those 2 brands, and some markets actually provides a Halo. So we're very pleased with the economy portfolio.","And in Premium Light, as you said, has been challenged in 2017. And Miller Lite's performance actually the fourth quarter is slightly greater than in the third quarter, and Coors Light challenge for us and we're putting a lot of effort behind it to revitalize it, mostly around the road most refreshing beer. We know that it works it works before. It provides a meaningful product benefit for us. It's shown significant growth in equity, and we probably moved a bit too far away from it. So you see of the world's most refreshing beer in a meaningful way as we head into 2018. Beyond that, Mark, I don't think I should give any more specifics.","Mark Hunter","Okay. Thanks, Gavin.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","I had -- well, first, I wanted to say congratulations to Dave. You spent a lot of time and patients handling our questions over the years, and I just want to thank you for that and wish you the best as you go off into retirement.","David Dunnewald","Thanks, Bryan. It's been my pleasure.","Bryan Spillane","I guess I have one clarification and one question. Tracey, when you talk about the $50 million of COGS inflation for 2018, is that net of any impact from the step up in amortization and in D&A? And then also a change in pension accounting, I think, geographically might take some the $27 million of pension income out of COGS and move it below the operating profit line? So just wanted to understand if that's a net number? And then the question I had was for -- I guess for Mark and Gavin. You know you've seen some more, I guess, investment or more activity in, I guess, the fitness beer category for the lack of a better word with Corona Premier coming and you've got I'm still bringing our product into the market.","So just kind of your thoughts on that segment as you get more sort of investment behind it, how it interacts with the Premium Light beers and just thoughts around that and how that's evolving would be helpful. Thanks.","Mark Hunter","Thanks, Bryan. Tracey, do you want to pick up clarification to Bryan's first part?","Tracey Joubert","Yes. So the incremental $50 million inflation that I quoted incremental above 2017 inflation as we saw is not just COGS. It's actually COGS and G&A, and it's across all of that business units that is primarily driven by commodity inflation so aluminum and diesel fuel would be the main drivers, but it's across all [indiscernible] MG&A and COGS. Then in terms of the pension changes so what I may be refer you to is our 10-K is actually up on our website now. We've got quite a detailed lay out in tables and expeditious if you want to refer to footnote 1 and footnote 21 in our 10-K, that's detailed the change in methodology. And in footnote two, actually details the changes around the safety accounting standards.","So Bryan, if you want to have a look at that and maybe come back to us after the call, we can break that down a little bit further for you.","Mark Hunter","Okay. Thanks, Tracey. And Bryan, just on your second question on this new segment that you invented the fitness beer category, I think I know what you're referring to. The good news is a few years descriptor, we have the original fitness beer we just called Miller Lite. That's what we're doubling down on. We continue to believe that continuing to focus on both Miller Lite and its very clear functional benefits and Coors Light and its very clear lifestyle benefits the best way to respond to interest in what you've described as fitness beer. The other thing that's of interest is quite significant crossover between some of the alcoholic seltzers that have come into the marketplace, and fitness or light beer and it's important that we offer bread across our portfolio. So across Miller Lite and Coors Light, we'll continue to strengthen their equities. We'll compete more assertively with Henry's Hard Sparkling, and we'll have the right products for 2018.","And then, obviously, some of the metric and imports kind of play into that space as well, and the introduction of Sal becomes very important for us. So we believe that there's more than enough on our plate and we've got to be choice will about ensuring that we deliver real focus behind our portfolio. And against the 2 big light brands, Henry's Hard Sparkling and Sol, we've got the right portfolio to compete effectively and that space if I'm defining it correctly.","Operator","The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","I wanted to solve on two things; first is just commentary on the commercial effectiveness and efficiency in the fourth quarter, just how much of that is one, can you talk a little bit about distinctive efforts there? And two, things that we're planned versus real more sort of real-time adjustments in the second half of the year as you saw that the industry volumes was soft, that was one area of question. And the second was just dimension of the incremental placement and visibility you have from your distributors. So was that primarily on Sol and the Arnold Palmer? Or is that incremental description of our new placement from some of what I'll call it legacy existing portfolio? Thanks.","Mark Hunter","Okay. So the second part of your question; Gavin, do you just want to pick up on the success on the placements the teams have been driving as we come into 2018?","Gavin Hattersley","Yes, sure. Thanks, Mark. We've got tens of thousands of placements for -- actually hundreds of thousands of placements for our innovation brands. You're rightly called them out as Sol and Arnold Palmer spiked half and half. Easy -- not easy, [indiscernible] which is our entry into the tea category and to try and recruit new drinkers into our economy portfolio, 21 through 24-year olds, which have primarily walked away from beer to hedges actually designed tens of thousands of new placements for that. And yes, we did get more presents for brands like Blue Moon and Coors Light and so on.","Mark Hunter","I think you invented a new brand there, Gavin.","Gavin Hattersley","I got caught up between Arnold Palmer and Two Hats. Arnold Palmer is the tea and the lightly flavored light beer to recruit new drinkers.","Mark Hunter","They're not sharing placements either. They have discrete placements, but I think...","Gavin Hattersley","Correct.","Mark Hunter","On the first part of your question Laurent, on just commercial effectiveness, I mean, clearly, as we've come through this year, we've worked very hard from a procurement perspective, a global media RFP, which is a very successful, which has allowed us moment to drive efficiency and productivity and some of our marketing dollars. And the simplest way to think about this is really coming to the year with an assumption around investment per hectoliter. When I was business unit CEO in Europe in this role, what we've attempted if we see their softness from a volume perspective because maybe the segment is underperforming overall, and we're trying to maintain our investment on a per hectoliter basis buy that means in totality, that investment may fall so we're still drive the same kind of productivity and impact per hectoliter.","There is a combination of maintaining that spend per hec, while at the same time also driving productivity through our roaming model so that gives us flexibility in a real-time basis to respond to segment changes, our brand momentum within our business. And hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a flavor.","Operator","The final question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Financial.","Mark Swartzberg","Dave, really been a pleasure working with you. So thank you, and Sam, too, thank you. My question, Tracey or Mark, is on the $330 million return of purchase price on the Miller International business, which I think was assigned a value of the $700 million. So in its face, it seems like this proportionally you're getting less to EBITDA, but it might mean that you simply thought you were getting a lot of working capital you didn't get. So I'm just trying to understand what was the basis for the return to the $330 million? Is it more working capital amount of EBITDA? Looking for some more detail there.","Mark Hunter","Okay. So let me try to try to keep it uncomplicated. The simplest way to think about this is the $330 million that we negotiated with is really a true-up an overall acquisition price the $12 billion -- $330 million. When we made the agreement to acquire the Miller brand internationally, we were very clear that there was a high-level assumption on the EBITDA. That was quite opaque because the Miller brands were embedded across the SAB business, and it wasn't a discrete business. So we started with an assumption and then said we would -- based on the trailing 12-month EBITDA close then get into purchase price adjustment. We kicked off that process and moved into a negotiation with ABI, and we feel that the true-up on overall acquisition price makes sense for us if you then look at the overall multiple we paid with the EBITDA stream. The good news is that the Miller brands are now fully adopted and integrated within our business and performing well with, I think, significant runway ahead of them in Canada and in Europe. And within International business, they're growing very, very strongly.","So if you also recall, Mark, one of the things that we pointed out was based on the assumption of the trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our business model, particularly for the International business, would be different because we would be sharing that margin with our partners and our distributors. So it was never going to be apples for apples. But in headline terms, just look on this as a true-up on acquisition cost. It's now dropped to less than $11.7 million. And if you look at the overall multiple we paid for the EBITDA we acquired then feeling very good about the outcome of that negotiation.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Hunter for any closing remarks.","Mark Hunter","Yes, many thanks for facilitating things today. Many thanks for your interest in the Molson Coors Brewing Company. We look forward to catching up with you in our next call and obviously, our Investor and Analyst Meeting we'll be having in New York in June of this year. So thanks for your interest in the company and look forward to speaking with you soon. Bye, everybody.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

I really appreciate it. Hello, and welcome, everybody. On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2013 follow-up earnings conference call.","Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible, following our regular earnings conference call with Peter Swinburn, Gavin Hattersley and our business unit CEOs earlier today. We will use a standard question-and-answer format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour.","So let's get started with an introduction of the team with me on this call. First of all, a special welcome to Kevin Kim, who joined the company 3 months ago as our new Investor Relations Manager. Today, we also have Spencer Schurr, Finance Forecasting Manager; Brian Tabolt, Senior Director of Technical and SEC Accounting; and Mark Saks, VP of Tax.","As Peter Swinburn mentioned on our regular earnings call earlier today, in the second quarter, our company delivered double-digit underlying profit growth, driven by earnings accretion from the Central Europe acquisition in June of last year, as well as improved financial performance in our Europe and International businesses, along with a lower tax rate. We also generated strong underlying EBITDA and free cash flow and reduced our net debt by $373 million in the quarter. We delivered these results despite weak consumer demand across all of our markets.","As discussed 2 months ago during our New York Investor Day, we are focused on the drivers that matter most in our business. These are driving strong core brand performance; leveraging our value-added innovation pipeline; increasing our share of above-premium sales; capturing significant, sustainable cost savings; and allocating cash via our disciplined tax-centered process that builds long-term shareholder value. In the remainder of the year, we expect consumer demand to remain weak. Despite this, we plan to increase our marketing investments behind our core brands and innovation in order to drive long-term total returns for our shareholders.","And with that, Kyle, we'd like to open it up for questions. Over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I wanted to go back to pricing in Canada, and I apologize if you've given all these numbers. I don't know if I caught everything. But so the negative 0.5% revenue per barrel, how much of that was price versus mix?","David Dunnewald","Yes. So price was positive 1% and then slightly more than offset by negative 1.5% mix. And mix includes, by the way, things like geographic mix, product mix, segment mix, that sort of thing.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And I know you talked about value growing faster. Can you give us the actual percentage numbers for value versus your premium?","David Dunnewald","No, not a separate number. But we did see growth in the economy brands ahead of -- well, actually, no, we'll give you at least a broad brush. Our economy brands were roughly flat in the quarter. As you know, the [indiscernible].","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Economy, right, okay. And within premium -- so in your portfolio, I think some of the brand performance you've cited were Molson Canadian, down 2%, 2.5%?","David Dunnewald","Cited where?","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I think in the press release, so sales volume for Molson Coors -- sorry, so you didn't give the -- do you have any other brand information, Coors Light, Molson Canadian?","David Dunnewald","Not specific numbers, no. We did say that we were pleased with the performance of the Molson Canadian brands in the quarter. Coors Light performance was not quite as strong as we've seen earlier in the year, partially driven by overlapping the introduction of Coors Light Iced T a year ago, which we include in those numbers.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then on Canada, so the cost per hectoliter increased more than 6%. I'm just trying to also just go through the drivers and quantify some of the drivers. You talked about the asset write-down as a big factor. How much was mix versus some of the others, like input cost inflation and fixed cost deleveraging?","David Dunnewald","Yes, there -- that's a good question, Judy. There are different ways, of course, to sort of bucket things. But what we mentioned was that asset writeoffs were about 1\/3 of the increase, which was just over 6% per hectoliter in local currency in the quarter. So about 1\/3 of it was asset writeoffs, things like equipment or obsolete inventory, that sort of thing. And then, beyond that, we had some incremental costs related to in-case promotions. That was about another 1\/3 of the increase. And then, finally, you have fixed cost deleverage and a bit of mix as well as the last 1\/3.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so the full year guidance being kind of in the mid-single-digit level does imply the back half moderates. And is that primarily because of the asset writeoff being really more of a one-off?","David Dunnewald","Yes. Certainly, asset writeoffs -- obsolete inventory can happen really any time. Equipment writeoffs are, I guess, less common. They can happen. But anyway, the 6% -- the main point around this is the 6% number is within the guidance, so I guess, we'll leave the forecast to you. But you're right, there are some aspects that are not -- sorry, some cost factors in the 6% in the second quarter that don't happen every quarter.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And are you assuming similar level of fixed cost deleveraging? Or is it your anticipation that certainly, in the fourth quarter, you do have much easier comps that, that component of the negative drag actually moderates?","David Dunnewald","Yes. Since fixed cost deleverage has a heavy component of volume in it, I'll leave that forecast to you.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then just on MCI, so I understand some of the drivers on the year-over-year impacting the percent changes. But if I look at just the absolute level of MG&A expenses for that division, it's been running kind of $50 million for the last couple of quarters. And so on an absolute basis, is there any reason to think that, that steps up in the back half?","David Dunnewald","Let's see. In the second quarter, we had benefit of some reduced costs in the MCI business, in other words, timing of marketing spend and particularly comparisons versus last year. For example, in the second quarter last year, we have the joint venture and we also were spending a lot more last year in the China -- the non-joint venture part of China. And so from a JV standpoint, we will have cycled the, call it, elimination of those costs midyear this year. From the standpoint of not spending as much on some of the, call it, low-margin accounts in the rest of China, not related to the joint venture, I'm not sure exactly when in the year we cycled that, but call it roughly around midyear.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But that's a year-over-year change, though. I mean I'm just looking at the absolute level of expenses in the first half. And so is this just partly timing of the spending that gets shifted into the back half as well so the absolute spending does indeed go up in the back half?","David Dunnewald","I'm not going to -- well, yes, I'm not going to forecast, again, the MG&A spend in the back half in MCI. I would say that there is -- the comparisons do -- well, we do have changing comparisons in the back half versus the first half of the year, which aided the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Mullarkey from Morningstar.","Thomas Mullarkey - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I guess I have a question to combine a couple of points made on this morning's call that was dealing with, I believe, MillerCoors. First, there was the objective that, over the next several years, the above-premium segment would go from about 9% of MillerCoors' volume to mid-teens. And then second, there was the comment that a barrel of Third Shift uses 3x the capacity of Miller Lite. Assuming that pretty much all your craft beers are probably more capacity-intensive than your Premium Lights, if you go ahead 2015, 2016, if MillerCoors, will they have enough slack capacity during the peak summer months given that Premium Light volumes will probably start rebounding and then the demand for the craft-like brews will be much stronger than as compared to now?","David Dunnewald","No -- yes, it's a good question. The 9% to mid-teens was something that we talked about in June in some MillerCoors meetings, which I'm sure you can listen to those on the web if you want. And then capacity utilization by brand, actually that varies quite a bit. There are actually some craft brands that, in some ways, don't use as much capacity as some of the Premium Light brands. So you're going to see a lot of variability around that. And the bottom line is we're confident that we're going to have the capacity to meet the needs of consumers for our products.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Shackleton from Nomura.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Dave, Ian Shackleton. A couple of questions. I mean, I asked Gavin a question around timing of cost savings during the year. And he made the comment, \"what's happening, we're reducing some of our guidance on COGS per hectoliter\" which seemed to imply that this is something that does become more of a factor in the second half. I just want to get some idea about that sort of $40 million to $60 million. How does that phase in during the year? Is it going to be fairly back-end loaded?","David Dunnewald","Well, we haven't provided granularity around the phasing of cost savings. I would say that the comments around changes in cost of goods, I'd say, the guidance around cost of goods per hectoliter is not necessarily indicative of changes in the timing of cost savings. I'd say -- if I were you, I'd go with the guidance that we gave or the goal, I guess, of $40 million to $60 million per year, the upper end of the range for the next 2 to 3 years. And that $40 million to $60 million is we expect to be able to achieve that over the next -- at least, the next 5 years.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And will you report on an annual basis what you've achieved each year? Will we get that number?","David Dunnewald","That's our intent, is to tell you what we've achieved at the end of each year and by the same token, to report on earnings accretion and how we're doing with the StarBev or Central Europe results and returns to shareholders.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. So you'd actually pull out the elements that relate to Central Europe and the U.K. and Central Europe merger as well?","David Dunnewald","Yes, that's right. That's kind of one of the commitments around the acquisition so that investors could, you could say, scorecard us on that deal. And that's -- and so that's the sort of approach that we took when we gave you the numbers. Well, I would just tell you the accretion in the second quarter from Central Europe was approximately $30 million on a pretax basis. On a full year basis, it was about $55 million, and that'd be since the end of June of last year. And if you throw in the 2 weeks before that when we owned the business, it'd actually be closer. So adding 2 more weeks, which are peak season, right, it actually gets to around $70 million pretax accretion from that acquisition. That would be on an underlying basis, so you're excluding some of the deal costs and financing-related costs.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, understood. One of the things I wanted to ask about, I think Mark Hunter was talking about including in -- I think this was, in the European markets you're in, where you talked about Q1 being minus 0.5% in Q2, minus 6%. Did I understand that correctly?","David Dunnewald","On a -- yes, okay.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","This is right toward the back end of the call.","David Dunnewald","Yes, 6% -- is that 6% volume we're talking about? Ian, was that 6% volume in the European segment?","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Well, my understanding was that those were market volumes for your markets in Europe, saying, it's a minus 6% for the industry in Q2 and a minus 0.5% for Q1. But I may have misunderstood that, I just wanted to check what he was actually referring to.","David Dunnewald","No, I appreciate the clarity. Yes, he was referring to industry trends, and he was trying to make the point that the industry really had faced a lot more challenges in the second quarter than it did in the first quarter. So that's right, those will be industry retail volume trends.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And this is U.K. and Central Europe combined? These are your markets?","David Dunnewald","Yes, it would be. That's right, all of Europe. So in our case -- exactly, it'd be our market. So it would be the Central Europe markets plus the U.K. and Ireland. Yes, all in, that's right.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And just to be clear, these are volumes, not value figures? These are volume figures?","David Dunnewald","Precisely, those are volume figures.","Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Great. One final question around Canada. Again, Stewart earlier on made some reference to shipments from Europe. And I wasn't quite sure what the reference there was. I mean, it does look -- given the STWs were weaker than STRs, but you've seen some stocking up at the end of the quarter. Is that what he was confirming?","David Dunnewald","Yes, essentially, he was giving you some details in the process. Essentially, let's call it the difference between STWs and STRs in Canada includes some trade inventories and even some in-transit from places like Europe. So because, as you know, we run 3 of the largest import brands in Canada, we manage those brands. Now just broadly speaking, that just means that there's a bit of a difference in inventories in the quarter. And yes, we expect over time that, that should even out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","A couple of quick ones. Can you give us -- when you guys said that the International business COGS per hectoliter are expected to be down low-single digits, I assume that's, I guess, an underlying or currency-neutral number. Is that correct?","David Dunnewald","That particular one is in U.S. dollars partly because we have so many currencies flowing through that International business. Think about businesses in China, Mexico, India, different parts in Europe, Asia, whatever. So that one is in U.S. dollars.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay, perfect. And then there was a point on the conference call, and I don't think I caught all of it. And I think, there was a -- if I remember correctly, there was a comment that, in Canada, volumes are down 100,000 hectoliters. And was it that half of that was attributable to the year-over-year comp on Coors Light Iced T?","David Dunnewald","Yes, that's what Stewart mentioned on the earlier call, that's right.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","But is -- so does -- I mean, if I have my numbers right, I mean, Canadian history is about 5 million hectoliters in a quarter. So that'd be -- basically, I mean, is Coors Light Iced T market share down 100 basis points year-over-year?","David Dunnewald","Well, I couldn't tell you what the industry is. Well, okay, around 6 million hectoliters. Remember, it's -- this is peak season, so the first quarter will be a lot lower. But I'll let you do the math, but I think you have the right numbers to work with.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay. Can you tell me -- I mean, what was the peak market share for Coors Light Iced T in Canada last year?","David Dunnewald","Off the top of my head, I don't recall what the market share was. My sense was it was around 1% round numbers. But that's kind of a distant memory, if you will.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from line of Jesse Reinherz from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A quick one on working capital savings. I know you guys mentioned that you had a target of $300 million from 2012 to 2014. Is that end of 2012 through 2014, so 2013 and 2014 comment? Or is it a 3-year comment?","David Dunnewald","It's a 3-year comment that included 2012, all of -- call it, all of 2012, if you want.","Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And any idea -- have you guys said anything on phasing? Or what was achieved in 2012 and thus is kind of leftover? Is it relatively even? Or...","David Dunnewald","Yes, we've mentioned. I don't remember if it was New York or one of the earnings calls, but it was around $70 million achieved last year in 2012.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","David Dunnewald","Okay, great.

In Canada and the U.K., we faced margin pressure from higher pension and input inflation, as well as increased marketing investments in the U.K. and cycling onetime costs in Canada.","Towards the end of the quarter, we launched a number of new line extensions. Within our core brand portfolio, Coors Light sales to retail grew more than 4% in the quarter driven by volume growth and market share gains in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K.  Most of the Canadian STRs increased to the low-single digit rate in Canada. We recently expanded Molson Canadian Lager into Quebec and have begun full national activation of our NHL sponsorship.","Miller Lite declined low-single digits but did receive revitalized brand messaging, new advertising creative and an even higher level of engagement with multicultural audiences across the U.S. beginning in March. We have been rolling out this new programming over the past few weeks, and the initial feedback from distributors and the retail trade has been very positive. ","Carling declined at a mid-single digit rate, reflecting the competitive U.K. market as 2011 consumer buying ahead of the 2012 price rise. We drove growth in our premium brands, including Rickard\u2019s, Creemore and Granville Islands in Canada; Blue Moon and Leinenkugel in the U.S.; and Cobra and Doom Bar in the U.K.","On the innovation front, we introduced Coors Light Iced T to Canadian consumers in April. In the U.S., we introduced Leinenkugel Summer Shandy and the Coors Light aluminum pints. In the U.K., we launched Carling Zest, refreshing citrus beer with 2.8% alcohol, especially designed to appeal to a broad range of adult consumers. And obviously, the major impact of these launches will occur during the remainder of the year.","The biggest news from Molson Coors in the first few months of 2012 was our agreement on April 3 to buy StarBev, the largest brewing business in central Europe, for EUR 2.65 billion or approximately USD $3.54 billion. This business generated 2011 sales of approximately $953 million and an EBITDA of $322 million under European Union IFRS. The purchase price represents a multiple of just under 11x EBITDA. StarBev brews 13.3 million hectoliters of beer annually and has the #1 brand in more than half of its markets, with strong positions in the rest.","The acquisition of StarBev fits squarely into our strategy to increase our portfolio of premium brands and deepen our reach into growth markets around the world. The central European beer market is attractive, with strong historical trends and upside potential. StarBev is a market leader in the central European region, and this acquisition provides Molson Coors with a great platform for growth and an excellent foundation from which to extend our key brands, such as Carling, into central Europe.","StarBev's international flagship brand, Staropramen, will also enhance our portfolio in some of our current unplanned markets. Investment levels behind the StarBev brands have been broadly appropriate, although we believe that a moderate increase is necessary to adequately support our planned innovation and brand strategy. Based on statutory tax rates, ranging from 10% to 20% in the 9 countries where StarBev does business, we expect our effective tax rates related to this business should be in the mid-teens. We'll update you at the appropriate time if this changes following the close.","We have consistently said that making targeted acquisitions that expand our global presence and drive shareholder value is a key pillar for our growth strategy. We believe the acquisition of StarBev is financially compelling, that meets all of our return on capital requirements and is consistent with these goals.","By way of an update, we are well along to completing this acquisition. We completed a public financing of $1.9 billion on May 3 and in the process, maintained our investment grade ratings. This debt issue was divided into tranches of $300 million for 5 years, $500 million for 10 years and $1.1 billion for 30 years, with very attractive coupons of 2%, 3.5% and 5%, respectively.","When combined with the 0 coupon EUR 500 million convertible issued to the seller  on short duration low-rate bank financing, we expect the average coupon to be about 4% on a book basis and in the 3s on a cash basis. Thus, the only steps remaining prior to closing the transaction are regulatory clearance from the EU and Serbia. We expect to complete these steps and close the acquisition before the end of the second quarter.","With that as an overview, I'll turn it over to Stewart to give first quarter financial highlights and a perspective on the balance of 2012. Stewart, over to you.","S. F. Glendinning","Thanks, Peter. Hello, everyone. First quarter financial highlights. On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $85.3 million or $0.47 per diluted share was 4.5% higher than a year ago, driven by positive beer pricing and sales mix across our company.  Underlying EPS increased 9.3%. Regionally, pretax equity income from MillerCoors drove our bottom line performance in the first quarter, with a 16.8% increase on the strength of solid pricing and sales mix, along with continuing cost reductions.","With respect to the U.S., we also note that there's some timing impact of spending in marketing, which we expect to reverse in the balance of the year and especially in the second quarter. Canada results were negatively influenced by approximately $4 million of onetime benefits realized in the first quarter of 2011. In the U.K., increased marketing investment, weaker off-premise pricing, primarily driven by customer mix, combined with lower volumes and input inflation negatively impacted our results. In addition, both U.K. and Canada results were affected by increased defined benefit pension expense of $6.6 million in total. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors decreased 0.4% due to lower volume in the U.K. and Canada, partially offset by 24% STR growth in international. ","For the first time, this quarter, I will provide some consolidated non-GAAP results that include our portion of MillerCoors. On this basis, total company net sales increased 1.9% in the first quarter driven by the U.S., Canada and international. Net sales per hectoliter increased 2.7% in the quarter, primarily due to solid pricing across our company and the addition of NAB contract brewing revenue in Canada.","Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 2.5% due to input cost inflation, higher pension expense and the addition of contract brewing volume in Canada.  Input inflation accounted for more than 3\/4 of the COGS increase and was largely driven by agricultural materials, packaging and fuel costs.","Total company gross margin was 37.9%, 10 basis points higher than a year ago, primarily due to solid pricing. Marketing, general and administration expense increased 4% due to higher pension costs and non-core StarBev transaction expenses, along with increased brand investments in the U.K. and international and cycling onetime costs in Canada. Excluding non-core StarBev expenses and Canada onetime costs, the MG&A increase was only 1.5% in the quarter.","Underlying operating margin was unchanged at 9%, with the increase in U.S. operating income offset by declines in Canada and the U.K. Please see the earnings release we distributed this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.","It is important to note that our first quarter underlying earnings exclude some special and other non-core gains, losses and expenses that net to a $6.4 million pretax charge. These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in this morning's earnings release.","In the first quarter 2011, our Resources for Growth 2 cost reduction program delivered $10 million in savings for the quarter and a total of $136 million of savings since the program began over 2 years ago. Regarding cash uses, we did not repurchase shares during the first quarter due to the potential -- and we do not expect further purchases until our debt ratios are closer to pre-StarBev levels.","Looking forward, regarding our 2012 guidance. We now expect our total company 2012 fund benefit pension expense to be approximately $70 million, including our portion of MillerCoors pension expense. This total expense is about $12 million higher than 2011 on an underlying basis, primarily due to lower long-term interest rates with higher expense in the U.K. and Canada offset by lower expense at MillerCoors.","Meanwhile, we expect to -- we continue to expect total cash contributions to our pensions to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million this year, up from $50 million in 2011, due to increased contributions in Canada and MillerCoors in the U.S.","Our outlook for capital spending, corporate interest expense, MG&A expense and corporate and effective tax rate have not changed from our last earnings call. Please note that all of these forward-looking statements exclude the StarBev business and related transaction and financing costs as the acquisition has not yet closed. We plan to update our outlook to include StarBev later in the year after we have closed and reported U.S. GAAP pro forma financial results for the business.","Looking forward, there are a number of considerations for our balance of the year financial performance. Regarding our cost outlook, in Canada, for 2012, we continue to expect our all-in cost of goods sold to increase at a mid-single digit rate per hectoliter in local currency, with the result weighted toward the first half due to the cost of NAB contract volume being largely absent from the first half results last year. ","In the U.S., we continue to expect liquids COGS per hectoliter to increase at a low-single digit rate for the full year 2012. In the U.K., we now expect our full year COGS per hectoliter to grow at a mid-single digit rate in local currency, down from high-single digits on our last earnings call. This change in expectation is primarily due to reduced sales forecast for low-margin beverage sales this year.","Most of the annual COGS increase in the U.K. is expected in the second quarter due to planned brewery redevelopment costs. We expect this redevelopment to drive significant operations efficiencies in the years ahead.  We expect higher pension expense of about $15 million in Canada and $10 million in the U.K. For the balance of the year, we are investing incrementally in our brands and innovation to drive better performance in the years ahead. Marketing investments are planned to be about $30 million higher across Canada, the U.K. and international. Marketing spending will also be higher in the U.S. for the balance of the year.","In other outlook, in the U.K., we expect the Europe football championships to accelerate volume from the third quarter to the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we don't anticipate any stock repurchases this year as we focus our cash use on paying down debt. Later this year, we'll be cycling lower employee incentive expense and the 53rd-week sales in Canada and the U.K. ","At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for a regional outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Peter?","Peter S. Swinburn","Thanks, Stewart. So in April, we rolled out Coors Light Iced T across Canada, and in June, our above-premium portfolio will be strengthened through the addition of the new Castle & Strongbow brands. In the U.S., we have strong marketing and sales programming behind our key brands this year, leading into the peak season, especially for Miller Lite, Coors Light and Miller 64. We are also introducing or testing a range of new brands, and we are rolling out a full slate of innovative packaging, including the Miller Lite punch top can to help build our existing brands. In the U.K., Carling Chrome and Carling Zest will receive increased marketing support, as will Coors Light to extend its current strong double-digit volume growth. ","The 2012 investment in our International business will be similar to last year, with phasing buyers to the first half of the year. Our overriding international goal remains to build this group of businesses quickly and to reduce some investment per hectoliter so that our international group becomes a significant contributor to total company profitability by 2015.","Finally, the following are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the second quarter. In Canada, our sales to retail for the first 4 weeks of the quarter declined at a mid-single digit rate versus 2011. In the U.S. for the 4 weeks ended April 28, STRs declined to a low-single digit rate on a trading day adjusted basis. In the first 4 weeks of the quarter, our U.K. STRs decreased at a high single-digit rate. And in the first 4 weeks, our international STRs have increased at a low double-digit rate. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.","So when we measured our first quarter against the 3 pillars of our strategy that we laid out for the first time at our investors in New York last year, we have grown profitability in our core markets but only because of an exceptional quarter in the U.S. While the Canada market showed signs of improvement, we need to improve our gross profit margins. And while we've increased share in the U.K., the issue remains one of market performance. International growth is in line with our plan, and we expect the acquisition of StarBev to improve our growth market exposure while delivering returns that will grow shareholder value. And as discussed in New York, our primary focus continues to be on the improvement of total shareholder returns in our core business.","Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, 2 quick comments. Firstly, our prepared remarks will be on the website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. And that call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website. ","Second point I would just like to reference is that we did announce some personnel changes today, namely that Mark Hunter will be moving from the U.K. to when the StarBev business subject to satisfactory close and regulatory improvement (sic) [approval]. Stewart Glendinning, CFO, will be moving to the U.K. and Ireland business; and Gavin Hattersley will be moving from our U.S. business to join us as CFO of Molson Coors.","I would just like to congratulate all 3 of those on the moves, which are heavily deserved. And so with that, I would like now to open it up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First, just in terms of Canada, so in Q1, you're down 0.5%. But competitively, it looks like you lost market share. So first, maybe you can talk about the competitive performance and how would you sort of assess your market share performance in Q1. And then just in terms of the April trend being down mid-single digit, how much of Q1 strength was sort of weather-driven? And why do you think April weakened, understanding that month-to-month there could be some volatility there?","Peter S. Swinburn","This goes to you, Dave.","David Perkins","Judy, yes, let me cover the different aspects, and let me start first with industry performance in Q1. On our fiscal basis, it was up about 1.3%. If you look at it on a calendar basis, it was up over 3%. Weather was certainly a positive factor during the quarter. Timing of Easter accelerated some volume from Q2 into Q1. And so it's our third consecutive quarter of industry growth now, so we're actually feeling good about that. We actually look like we outpaced the total beverage alcohol category in Q1 as well, so some positive things on the industry. But I do want to acknowledge the role of Easter and weather in that. On our market share performance and specifically, Judy, Coors Light, Molson Canadian both grew in the quarter, as did our above-premium portfolio. Our nonstrategic brands declined consistent with what I talked about last quarter, but that was largely offset by strategic brand growth everywhere but the West. And it's in the West that our share decline was concentrated. In the West, we achieved really strong NSR per hectoliter growth as we moved our value brands up and we shifted our promotional activity to less costly packs. But there's no doubt that came at the expense of share and volume, so we're just rebalancing that now. And as we look to April then in the mid-single digit decline in volume, I would say that Easter would certainly be a consideration in that with the acceleration to Q1. We had very cold weather in our major Eastern markets through the month. And I would say that our price competitiveness in the West, the factors I just talked about continue on into April and will likely continue on the early part of May as well.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So Dave, just following up on that. So I guess, can you maybe quantify how much non-strategic brands were down? And kind of how should we think about that portion of your portfolio just in terms of as you see the decline in those brands shouldn't we see better maybe pricing and better profitability? And I understand Q1, there's a lot of noise in the COGS line. But it seems like maybe you're not getting sort of the benefit of decline in some of the nonstrategic brands that you -- at the profit line.","David Perkins","Yes, I mean, the decline of the nonstrategic brands, I think the important thing to understand about those brands is they're actually quite profitable because there's low levels of support on them. They tend to have NSR similar to our mainstream brands, but at the bottom line, the contribution is quite strong. Really, the challenge for us, and I think I mentioned this the last quarter as well, is for us to get both innovation and core brands growing at a rate that it more than offsets what's happening on our nonstrategic brands. Nonstrategic brands would be in and around 10% of our total business, and there's nothing that we want to do by way of attention there to try to prop them up. It's really about leaning hard into our strategic brands. That's what we're doing. I think other than the challenge we've had in the West, pretty happy with what I've seen east of the Manitoba border in Q1.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the StarBev acquisition, maybe just taking a step back and talk more just from an organizational capability perspective because, obviously, Molson Coors have gone through some mergers and acquisitions with Molson and others. And I'm just wondering just based on your experience just looking back, some of the lessons that you've learned in sort of identifying what the right level of marketing spend, why do you think that the marketing investments in the StarBev business is appropriate and whether we should really not expect an even bigger step-up in terms of the brand investments. And you're making some personnel changes here, so any risk through -- as you're looking at the acquisition and some of the organizational changes and how you sort of keep the core business improving because that seems to be still your key focus. At the same time, you're obviously trying to implement this large-sized acquisition.","Peter S. Swinburn","Okay, Judy. I'll try and answer all of that, if I can. Let me take the personnel and organization changes first. We're in very fortunate position to be able to announce the changes that we've made. There's obviously very capable people. The reality is that I could have chosen at least another 3 or 6 people to have done those roles. And the one thing I think we have done over recent years is build  up a huge strength of depth -- strength in depth, I'm sorry, of people. Now that goes to the overall teams as well. So as a leader of the business, I have to make sure that if anything happens to any of our business unit leaders, be it Dave, Mark or anyone else, in some sort of crisis that we've got people to come step in, but also teams below them, that are very, very capable of running the business, and that's what we have. So as far as the existing business is concerned, I'm absolutely confident that, that will be -- we won't miss a heartbeat. As far as the StarBev business is concerned, I think we mentioned when we made the acquisition that we are very impressed with the management team over there. I have been over there to speak to all of the management team. And even this morning, we were on a call, and the message there, very clearly, is business as usual. So again, with Mark moving over to lead that business, I don't think we'll miss a heartbeat. Their plans are laid out. We know what they're plans are. We went through their plans in due diligence. We've got strong belief in their plans, and everybody needs to achieve them. So really, I think that's the strength as far as we are concerned. And as you say we've been to this process quite a few times in recent years. Specifically, on the marketing spend, we did, as you would expect, a huge amount of due diligence market by market, brand by brand. And obviously, one of the things that we looked at was the relative spend of the StarBev business against the competitive bench and also, the performance of brands by market. And based on that, we made some assessments, which, we think, are very realistic about how we would need to put behind the brands. And this is really market by market. It's not a layer approach. It's very specific to brands by market. And so again, we're very confident that the numbers that we have in are the correct amount, and we don't believe there'll be any need to increase them. Did that answer your question?","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Peter or Dave, could give us an update on how Coors Light Iced T is going in Canada and where you're headed on the opportunity for that innovation in the U.S.?","Peter S. Swinburn","I'll take the second part. Well, no, actually, what I'll -- Tom, do you want to take the second part of that -- the front, and then we'll pass it on to Dave?","Tom Long","Sure. We're watching the rollout of Coors Light Iced T very carefully and, of course, we borrow with no pride at all. We're eager to find successful products across the country, and Coors Light Iced T in Canada is a great innovation that we're watching carefully. So we would be prepared to launch it given the success, and as if we learn about how the drinker base works, so we're watching that closely.","David Perkins","Again, Mark, it's Dave. It's not a very robust update to give. I'm -- we're in full distribution now. Above the line marketing support started April 23. So it's quite recent. Certainly, all the indications that we're getting in the early days are positive. We're seeing the numbers come in where we'd hoped to. We're achieving the pricing that we'd hoped to on the brand. It is very early days.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then, I wonder, Peter, if you could just talk sort of philosophically about marketing spend as we think beyond 2012, you're going to own StarBev. You've called out, for 2 quarters now, the intention to really up the level of spend in markets other than in the United States. So as you think about how you prioritize spend, I guess, my 2 questions are, it seems like the U.S. is a lagger at least in 2012 in terms of rate of increase. So it that something we should view as kind of a strategic statement? Or is it just kind of an anomaly for the year? How are you thinking about how you allocate these dollars on a multi-geography basis?","Peter S. Swinburn","Okay. Well, I think over the full year -- or can I let the U.S. team speak to it. We are looking -- we will be looking to increase marketing spend from hereon in, so Q1 shouldn't be an indicator of the future. And I think, Tom and the team talked about this morning but I'll let them jump in later on if they want to. As far as this year and looking forward is concerned, Mark, the -- we really tried to link this year's increased expenditure to 2 things: one was an increased innovation pipeline. We see that innovation pipeline being pretty full for 3 years, and so we would see this is a rebate, if you like, looking forward. But also, some of that money will also go on our core brands. So I think we've got to a level this year where we want to get it to you looking forward. As an indicator, obviously, that will move around at the margins plus or minus X%, obviously. But that would be really the way we're thinking about it. Shawn, do you want to add anything on the U.S.?","Unknown Executive","No, I don't think so. I think that captures our position, Peter.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And to my -- and I mean, the number as I understand it, the percentage increases are much more dramatic outside the U.S. even once you factor in the full year plans for the U.S. Is that a fair understanding? And can you just speak to that as an indication of priorities by region?","Peter S. Swinburn","Well, I don't believe such priorities. I mean, it will be much a higher percentage because the U.S. base is considerably higher than either the U.K. or Canada. If you look at our marketing expenditure as a percentage of turnover, I think you'll find that we're trying to catch up in some of the other geographies compared to the U.S. So I think overall, we're in a pretty good position geography by geography.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher from JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In general, Eastern Europe is viewed as somewhat of an emerging market. And I guess, the only issue becomes with beer, you've got much higher per capita consumption to start with. So can you talk about sort of how we should view the development of Eastern Europe from a beer standpoint? And as we look at your growth expectations going forward, where can per capita consumption go? Where can pricing go? Where can market share go because most of these countries, at this point, seem relatively well developed?","Peter S. Swinburn","John, a couple of things. I think the per capita consumption does vary country by country, and we are in actually 9 different countries. So that's the first point I would make. Everything that we've seen in these countries because as you say that's somewhat emerging markets reflects the fact that the per capita consumption is -- there is a very, very strong correlation between that and GDP growth. And so you have take a view on what's going to happen to the GDP growth in these countries. And yes, it's going to be volatile. But over the -- if you average it out, looking forward over the next 5 to 10 years, we see that is a positive trend. And so really that's the background to it.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So I guess, if you look at this, can you talk about, then maybe getting down to some of the more specific countries within the StarBev acquisition Czech, obviously, very high per capita consumption, low market share there. Where do you line up well in terms of maybe high market share and growing per capita consumption or high per capita consumption and low market share? Just trying to understand where the opportunities are.","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes, I think it's probably in terms of detail because we're talking about 9 countries and a multiplicity of brands, Dave can pick the real detail on that later on. But if I was to give you a background, I mean, as I mentioned, we have got the #1 brand in 5 of the markets that we're talking about. And within that 5, there are a good number where we see opportunity to continue to grow our market share position or certainly hold it and improve value around that piece and also see improvements within the overall velocity of the market. So we're comfortable that there is opportunity. It does vary market by market, but Dave can take you to the detail about later on, if you like.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","You're talking about being less price competitive in the West than Canada. Can you talk about you got there? Was it discounting? Or do you take price up and it wasn't followed? And then finally, is it safe to assume that since you talked about -- not to put words in your mouth, but basically rolling back on price, should we see the price decelerate over the back end of the year or is there an offset?","David Perkins","Yes, okay. In the West, what we did is we moved our value brands up certainly at a rate higher than the rest of the market in any of the GPIs. So we're trying to close the gap between our value brands and our mainstream. In addition, a lot of the promotional activity in the West is happening in fairly expensive SKUs, and so we attempted to shift that to less costly SKUs. That worked in part, but it didn't work the way we wanted it to because it wasn't the general market move, and we haven't seen the market move that way. So we're finding ourselves less competitive now, and that's why we're rolling back. In terms of the impact it will have on NSR, going forward, I wouldn't characterize is as particularly material on a national basis. Certainly, in the West, it will have some impact.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Do -- can I just follow up? On the value brands, you moved up and did -- is it fair to say competition didn't follow?","David Dunnewald","Yes. We found ourselves uncompetitive after having moved up, so our value brands ended up above the market.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, I just want to make sure I understood the pension expense increase correctly. It's going to be -- it's a 1,200 million -- or I'm sorry, $12 million incremental expense relative to last year. Is that just for the U.K. and Canada or that's including the offset from the U.S.?","S. F. Glendinning","No, that includes the offset from the U.S.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So it's -- the U.K. and Canada, specifically, are $25 million higher combined?","S. F. Glendinning","Yes, that's correct, $25 million combined.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. And then -- so the $6.5 million of higher pension costs that you referenced earlier in the call is just the U.K. and Canada, right? That matches -- that's basically phasing in the $25 million in the U.K. and Canada?","S. F. Glendinning","That's correct. That's $6.6 million just for the first quarter.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, okay. And so -- okay. And then, I guess, more broadly, as you went into this year in your core markets, basically, the expectation or the plan is to basically drive more volume growth in order to drive the P&L. And I guess, you factored out the weather in the U.S. in the first quarter, which helped in the U.S. and maybe to an extent it helped in Canada as well. Is there anything just in terms of the overall environment that has changed your thinking at all in terms of your ability to do that? Is the consumer any better or worse than it was when you set your original plan? Just want to try and get a sense for how you feel about your plans and sort of what the environment's willing to give in terms of a more volume-driven plan.","Peter S. Swinburn","Okay. So I mean, obviously, not just volume, it's balancing the volume with the NSR growth, what we've been trying to do, Bryan. But if I try and encapsulate it, I would say that we have been, all things being equal, probably pleasant, cautiously pleasantly surprised with the U.S. and Canada. The markets are probably even better than we expected. To be honest, no idea whether that will continue, but that's what we would say, and probably the U.K. is being the same as we expected, which is difficult. So that's some of it. I mean, before April, I think we would've been a bit more positive, but you've seen the numbers in April, and so it really reflects consumer trends at the moment. It's pretty volatile, to be honest with you. But overall, yes, I think Canada and U.S. is probably more positive than we expected.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And fairly characterize that you'd be effective -- the first quarter didn't really see a full effect of all of the marketing and product innovation that you've got planned. I mean, it's part of driving the NSR. So I mean, we're not really seeing the effect of what you're investing to drive that better revenue growth. Is that fair characterization?","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes, absolutely fair to say that marking it both from a marketing investment line on our core brands but also from innovation. Really, we should see the major benefit of that in the remaining of the year -- remainder of the year.","S. F. Glendinning","So Bryan, I would just add to that by saying that, of course, the first quarter is a slower quarter than any of the others. And second, as Peter highlighted, a good deal of our investment has gone behind new innovation. And as always, that innovation has some ramp-up period that there's a part for you to consider.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, Peter, that -- I guess, since the StarBev acquisition was announced, the stock is -- your stock has underperformed. And I guess, if I can encapsulate, I guess, there was a disconnect in terms of what you're seeing in terms of the value in StarBev versus what maybe the market was hoping for, whether that was a dividend or a bigger share repurchase or some other use of the capital. Can you just talk to how you viewed that difference in terms of where the value lies in StarBev relative to doing those other kind of capital return options?","Peter S. Swinburn","Yes, I mean, what I can say, Bryan, is that really over the last 3 years plus, we've consistently examined with our board the best way to use any cash that we have at any point in time. And we've always judged the usage of that cash against total shareholder return in the medium to long term. And as we announced a year ago, it was appropriate to use that cash for share buybacks because there was no other option on the table when StarBev came up. It was an option at the price that we bought it at, which was below 11x EBITDA multiple. It really satisfied all the financial criteria we laid out and both in our estimation and the board agreed, so over the medium to long term, that was a better way to use our cash. It will be much easier to talk about StarBev in the fine detail when we actually own the business. But you understand, at the moment, we're bound by confidentiality. So I think a lot more will become clear when we'll be able to talk in more detail as to our beliefs and our rationale. So I'd ask you just to be patient on that for a little bit longer.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of James Watson with HSBC.","James C. Watson - HSBC, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on Canada and the market share loss. I was actually surprised when you said that the nonstrategic brands were kind of had a similar profitability, similar bottom line effect. I wanted to find out what -- how you guys define your strategic versus nonstrategic brands? And are you okay with the share loss assuming that it's all in nonstrategic brands and your strategic brands are maintaining or gaining share?","David Perkins","Yes, okay. Let me take a crack at that, James. I mean, the way we define a strategic brand is essentially one that we're investing behind to maintain or grow for the future. And there's about a dozen brands that would fall into that camp. The nonstrategic brands are brands that were either fully harvesting or that we may be spending a little bit on to moderate the decline in some cases. But generally, they're harvest brands. And for us, what's important is really to have a stable to growing market share over time. I mean, we want a portfolio that is capable of ensuring that we're competitive within the category. And so it's important to us that our supported brands, our strategic brands do get to a point where they're fully offsetting and more than offsetting the decline of those nonstrategic brands. Now some of our strategic brands also have premium, above-premium pricing. You know that we have a strong above-premium portfolio. But even if you look at our innovation like Coors Light Iced T, that is coming in at an above-mainstream pricing, an above-premium pricing. And so that will have a beneficial impact on our NSR and on our margins.","James C. Watson - HSBC, Research Division","So that's something where even if the share losses coming from lack of the nonstrategic, we should still be seeing kind of mix benefits and gains through higher-priced brands?","David Perkins","Yes. I mean, over the longer term, what we're attempting to do on our portfolio is ensure that the kind of segment shifts the we see happening in the market don't disadvantage us. So over time, we see the mainstream segment declining, the above-premium increasing and the value segment tends to vary. Generally, it has trended up, but there are times when you'll see it reverse itself. We need to have fair share within each of those 3 pricing segments so that as the market shifts, it doesn't mathematically cause our market share to decline. And then within the portfolio, we want to push the premium-ization. Premium-ization is the growth of the above-premium segment, but it is also the kind of innovation that we do in the mainstream segment. So I don't consider Coors Light Iced T a true above-premium brand, but it is commanding a price index that is very attractive to us. And so within the mainstream, to the extent that we can push towards higher priced products, we will.","James C. Watson - HSBC, Research Division","So is it fair to say that your marketing investment kind of matches your outlook there in terms of above-premium being higher growth so you'd have a little bit over-index if in terms of marketing on that segment?","David Perkins","That would be fair, although I would emphasize that the investment that we make behind Coors Light and Canadian, which are our power brands that are absolutely critical to keeping our breweries running and maintaining our bottom line, get very healthy investment.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back for any closing comments.","Peter S. Swinburn","Okay. Thanks, Steve, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today and for your interest in the business. And we look forward to speaking to you again at the end of our next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
