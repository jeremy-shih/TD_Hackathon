As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will come at that time.","Certain statements made during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. The words we expect, believe, anticipate and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify those forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and information that is currently available. Although, Nucor believes we are based on reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that future events will not affect their accuracy.","More information about the risk and uncertainties related to these forward-looking statements may be found in Nucor's latest 10-K and subsequently filed 10-Qs which are available on the SEC's and Nucor's website. The forward-looking statements made in this conference call speak only as of this date and Nucor does not assume any obligation to update them either as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Ferriola, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Nucor Corporation. Please go ahead sir.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us our first quarter earnings call and thank you for your interest in Nucor. Other members of Nucor's executive team are also on the call today including Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Joe Stratman, our Chief Digital Officer; Craig Feldman, responsible for Raw Materials; Ladd Hall, responsible for Sheet and Tubular Products; Ray Napolitan, responsible for Engineered Bar Products; Dave Sumoski, responsible for Merchant Bar and Rebar Products; Leon Topalian, responsible for Beam and Plate Products; and Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated Construction Products.","Lastly, Joe Stratman announced this plan to retire from Nucor on June 8th after more than 29 years of dedicated service to Nucor. Joe has been an exceptional and resourceful leader who has made outstanding contributions throughout this career with Nucor, which has included key roles in our steel, raw materials, and steel products businesses. Joe also served as our Executive Vice President of Business Development and most recently, as our Chief Digital Officer.","Joe, thank you for your leadership, you have played a key role in positioning Nucor for continued success in the years to come. Speaking personally and on behalf of our 26,000 teammates, we want you to know that you will be missed and that we wish you and Jill the very best as you begin this new chapter in your life. Effective May 19th, Mary Emily Slate will be promoted to Executive Vice President and will assume responsibilities for the tubular products group, logistics and certainly joint ventures.","Mary Emily is a dynamic leader with 19 years of experience at Nucor in senior sales and operational management roles. We look forward to her building on the success that Ladd Hall and his team have achieved in tubular products. Ladd Hall will continue to serve as Executive Vice President of Sheet products. Ray Napolitan will assume responsibility for Nucor's digital initiatives while also continuing in his role as EVP of Engineered Bar Products.","Before we discuss our strong first quarter results, I want to emphasize that safety is number one priority for everyone on the Nucor team. While we consistently lead the industry in safety outcomes, our goal remains zero incidents at every Nucor facility. We will keep working to achieve this goal by continuously identifying and mitigating safety risks. That is the mindset that will drive our success.","By working together, the Nucor way, I have no doubt that we can achieve our goal of zero incidents. And while I'm on the subject of safety, I would also like to congratulate and thank our teammates at Nucor Gallatin for being recognized as a VPP Star Site by Kentucky's Division of Education and Training.","Nucor Gallatin is only the 13th site to be awarded this designation by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. For those of you who are not familiar, Kentucky's VPP or Voluntary Protection Partnership program is similar to the federal government's OSHA VPP program. These programs are the goal standard by implementing and maintaining safety and health management systems.","To achieve VPP status, companies must meet rigorous qualifying criteria and undergo an extensive onsite evaluation. After a two year process, Gallatin is the 24th Nucor division to achieve this impressive recognition. Each of our VPP starred divisions must demonstrate continuous improvement and safety and health in order to maintain the designation going forward.","Congratulations again to my teammates at Gallatin on this outstanding achievement and my continued thanks to all Nucor teammates who put safety first, every day. Let's continue to set the bar higher for all manufacturers and lead the way towards better safety outcomes for all.","Moving on to our first quarter result, Nucor achieved significant year-over-year improvements in our first quarter earnings, again demonstrating the value of our position as North America's most diversified producer of steel and steel products.","The steel making operations that contributed most significantly to the improvement over the prior year include our plate, rebar, merchant bar, engineered bar and beam mills. Several of our downstream businesses also achieved earnings gains compared to the first quarter of 2018 including our metal buildings, joist and deck products and piling products.","Jim Frias will discuss these results and outlook in more detail shortly. There's been a lot of commentary about capacity expansion plans announced by the U.S. steel industry. While we will not speak to the plans of other participants in our industry, Nucor's long-term strategy for profitable growth is both disciplined and sustainable.","Sustainability is achieved by making strategic investments that position Nucor to deliver a superior value proposition in cost, quality and service to our customers. Discipline is driven by Nucor's laser focus on being effective stewards of the capital that our shareholders entrust to us.","We only deploy capital on growth projects when we identify high return opportunities that will create value for our shareholders. Importantly, our senior management incentive compensation plans are directly tied to Nucor's return on equity and return on capital performance, aligning pay with performance and value creation.","We have announced 10 significant growth projects. We anticipate that six of these projects will begin operating this year including the new specialty cold rolling mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas, which came online during the first quarter. We expect all 10 of these projects to be in operation by 2022. These projects will create approximately a 1,500 direct jobs and we believe at least 7,500 indirect jobs.","With respect to the six projects set to begin operations this year, three projects expand the value added capabilities of our flat rolled steel operations and the other three projects improve the competitive the position of our rebar and merchant bar long products businesses. Let me provide more detail about the new specialty cold rolling mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas and two others that will start up this summer.","First, our new specialty cold rolling mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas had a successful startup in March. We have already delivered to customers prime product both pickled and oiled as well as fully processed cold-rolled product and production continues to ramp up. This flexible cold reduction mill expands our capability to produce motor lamination, high strength low alloy and advanced high-strength steel products. Congratulations to the entire Nucor Steel Arkansas team on a very successful startup.","The second project Nucor Steel Marion's new in-line rolling mill is scheduled to start up in the third quarter. The newly installed reheat furnace is running well and delivering the anticipated reductions in energy use. These upgrades will significantly improve Marion's cost structure and position the mill as a leader in the regional rebar market that it serves.","And third, we expect our sheet mill in Kentucky, Nucor Steel Gallatin to begin producing pickled and oiled coils in July and galvanized coils in August for mills new 72 inch galvanizing line will be the widest hot-rolled galvanizing facility in North America. It expands our capability to serve the automotive and other value-added markets.","Three other projects our joint venture galvanizing line with JFE Steel in Mexico, the merchant bar mill expansion in Illinois and the new rebar micro mill in Missouri are all on track to start up later in 2019. I also should mention that we have recently received our permits and commenced construction on our Frostproof Florida rebar micro mill. We are targeting start up there in mid-2020.","In March, we announced a plan to build a new state-of-the-art plate mill in Brandenburg, Kentucky. This is a strategic move to solidify Nucor's position as a leader in the U.S. plate market, not just in terms of volume, but also quality, reliability and cost. The new mill will give us the ability to produce 97% of the plate products consumed in the United States including specialty high-margin grades.","Our site on the Ohio River is located in the center of the country's largest plate consuming market, strengthening our ability to serve our customers with lower freight costs and superior on-time delivery. Further, we will be in a region with abundance low cost graph that is well covered by our David J. Joseph scrap business. We are excited about this investment in our entire pipeline of value enhancing growth projects.","Nucor has achieved success over the past five decades by building market leadership positions and we have done this by providing our customers with unmatched performance in quality, cost, product range and on time delivery. At Nucor, we build powerful partnerships that deliver powerful results. The more successful we can make our customers, the greatest success we will have as Nucor shareholders and teammates.","Jim Frias will now provide more specific detail about our first quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of this year. Jim?","Jim Frias","Thanks John. Nucor reported first quarter of 2019 earnings of $1.63 per diluted share. Included in these results was a benefit of $0.08 per diluted share related to the gain on the sale of an investment in our raw material segment. Excluding this non-recurring gain first quarter performance exceeded our guidance range of $1.45 to $1.50 per diluted share. As John discussed, Nucor continues to benefit from our diversified business model.","Another key strength of Nucor's business model is strong through the cycle cash flow generation. First quarter 2019 cash provided from operations was $651 million, even after funding just over $300 million in profit sharing earned by Nucor's teammates in 2018. Inventory was a source of about $108 million in the quarter, even as net sales were approximately 10% higher year-on-year.","Consistent with Nucor's disciplined approach to capital allocation, other major uses of cash during the quarter were capital expenditures of $289 million, dividends of $123 million and stock repurchases of $73 million. We returned almost 40% of net income for the quarter to our shareholders while also investing for long-term profitable growth. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash on hand.","Nucor teammates are executing the current stages of our long-term growth strategy and we therefore expect to accelerate our capital spending as the year progresses. For the full year of 2019, we continue to estimate that our capital expenditures will total approximately $1.8 billion. Nucor's financial condition remained strong with total debt outstanding of $4.3 billion.","Our gross debt to capital ratio was 29% at the end of the first quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023. It is worth noting that our first quarter results included $19.6 million of pre-operating start-up costs related to strategic investment projects. That is an increase from $17.4 million in the fourth quarter 2018 and $2.3 million in the year ago first quarter.","Now turning to the outlook, we expect 2019 to be another robust earnings year for Nucor. We continue to be encouraged by the overall strength of our domestic and use markets. In fact, we see stable or improving demand in 21 of the 24 end-use markets we monitor. One market power transmission is seeing a meaningful decline due to the completion of major grid extension projects in 2018.","Automotive OEMs and automotive suppliers comprise the other two markets that we expect to decline for the year. However, we anticipate that the decline in automotive unit volumes will be moderate and the new core will actually grow it shipments to these customers in 2019. Of course, the largest source of demand for our products are applications in non-residential construction, which appears set for another solid year in 2019.","Earnings the second quarter of 2019 are expected to be similar to the first quarter excluding the gain on the sale of the investment. We expect similar linked quarter performance in the steel mill segment as improving margins for structural environmental products offset weakening margins in our sheet and plate mills. The steel products segment is expected to achieve significant improvement in the second quarter over the first quarter as typical seasonal patterns and improved weather conditions benefit construction activity.","The performance of the raw material segment is expected to decline in the second quarter compared to the first quarter due to further margin pressure at our direct reduced iron or DRI plant.","Thank you for your interest in our company. I will now turn the call back over to John.","John Ferriola","Thanks, Jim. Before we take questions, I want to make a few remarks about trade. Nucor has long maintained and more importantly consistently demonstrated that when operating on a level playing field, we can successfully compete with any steel producer in the world. Free and fair trade is a critical underpinning to the continued success to both Nucor and our customers.","While much of the focus has been on Section 232 steel tariffs, prosecuting trade cases remains vital to ensuring a level playing field. For that reason, Nucor applause the recent determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission that there is reasonable indication of material injury from imports of fabricated structural steel on China, Canada and Mexico that are subsidized and sold into the United States at less than fair value.","More effective enforcement rules-based trade has made a significant contribution to improve performance of the U.S. economy in recent years, benefiting the steel industry and the entire domestic manufacturing sector. 2019 is going to be another exciting year for our company, as we continue to bring new projects online. We will continue to pursue profitable growth opportunities and we remain confident that Nucor's diversified business model will enable us to continue to outperform the industry over the course of the economic cycle.","Thank you to our more than 26,000 teammates for the way you execute our strategy and thank you for the work that you do every day to build a safe and more profitable Nucor. I would also like to say thank you to our customers. We appreciate the trust you place in Nucor and we will continue to do our very best to earn it with every order. And finally, thank you to our investors for entrusting us with your valuable capital.","We would now be happy to answer questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] And we'll take our first question today for Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Korn","I've got two for you, one near-term and one a little bit longer term. First is on expectations next quarter, you mentioned thinning margins for sheet and plate and offset by better profitability in structure and rail, excuse me structural and bar. How should volumes across your platform look relative to last year across these different segments particularly as Mary is ramping up? And is there any patch-up potential of the weather delays seen against the first quarter? And then my second question is on what you just mentioned John that fabricated structural steel trade case. How do you think about the opportunity that that could bring to Nucor, how much do you sell right now in terms of tonnage and revenue today what that represents, and is that a market where you had been seeing increasing pressure from imports? Thanks a lot.","John Ferriola","Well, I'll tackle the first question first and that's on volumes going into the second quarter. You know, we've mentioned that we see demand pretty consistent. In fact, maybe a little bit growing in -- on the sheet side, on the hot band side, when we look at our order entry over the last couple of weeks, marginal growth, small growth, but a good sign, so as we go into the second quarter, we expect the volumes to be about the same, particularly in those products that you mentioned.","Our downstream businesses might see a little bit better volume based on the weather conditions that are improving. We had a long winter. We had a very wet spring. It seems to be correcting now. So, we might see a bit of a pickup in our downstream businesses, but overall, I think going into the second quarter, I would say, our volume are going to be pretty consistent.","In terms of the second question, remember, first of all, that this is a preliminary position, so we don't have a final ruling on this yet, we are optimistic that we will get a positive outcome in the final determination. I will tell you that this could be very good news from us, we've been seeing a lot of a -- we sell about 50% of our beam, structural products into our fabricating businesses. That's about 1 million tons a year that we sell into fabricated steel construction and it hurt, we're hurt on demand, it hurt on pricing and we think that that's a result of truly dumped and illegally and unfairly traded products coming in.","Canada, Mexico and China being the three biggest violators of our trade laws in this product. So, we see it as a big plus, if we get a positive outcome, we are confident we're going to get positive outcome. We will just wait to see what happens.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Martin Englert with Jefferies.","Martin Englert","Can you provide a little bit of commentary given the recent flooding on the river system, maybe discuss how this has impacted your material sourcing and if it has had any temporary implications for the input cost for the Company?","John Ferriola","Overall, we've done quite well through the flooding. I'd say our most seriously impacted plant was on Nebraska facility where we had significant flooding in the division. We have lost a bridge that we use for rail transportation in and out of the town of Norfolk, but I got to tell you the team there did a great job responding to the crisis. We had minimal impact if anything over the course of a month.","And in general, when we talk about the river, in terms of raw materials coming in and out, there really hasn't been much of an impact at all. The river has been pretty good in terms of the flooding, we haven't had too much of an issue, a little bit on the Mississippi, but nothing that's impacted our plants, either with shipments going out or raw materials coming in.","Martin Englert","Okay, thanks for the detail there. And if I could one other, within the release, you did highlight the internal growth initiative, but also called out other growth opportunities. Any more detail you could provide around this? And would it be something focused on the core steel segment domestically based or something else?","John Ferriola","Anything that was outside of what we mentioned specifically in the opening comments, we will not be able to comment on.","Operator","Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank has our next question.","Chris Terry","Hi, John and team. Just a follow-up to that last one maybe more conceptually, the comments on the front around the other potential growth opportunities, these are independent of the ten projects that you've spoken about, I just wanted if you could comment on that, and secondly just on the guidance for next quarter, I know you touched on the volumes, you expect to be flat to potentially a touch up. I would have thought that the spreads would still be widening, so that appears conservative on the guidance. Just wondered, if you could comment on that as well?","John Ferriola","First of all, on the comment about our potential growth opportunities outside of what we mentioned, it's a general statement. We are constantly looking for good opportunities to grow our Company profitably. You've heard me mention many times our five drivers of profitable growth as we are constantly on the lookout for opportunities that fit those five drivers of profitable growth and continue to grow the diversity of our Company.","We take great pride in the fact that we're the most diversified steel and steel products Company in North America for sure, and we think that brings great value to our customers and to our shareholders.","So we will continue to look for opportunities that expanded there, and that met with the criteria we've established in our five drivers of profitable growth, but beyond that, I really can't say anything more specific.","In terms of the earnings going into the second quarter, what we said was they will be similar and I think that's really all we can say at this time. We are in a very cyclical business, things change rapidly. As we see the second quarter right now, we see the earnings, the volumes to be about the same, we see the earnings to be similar and that's how we view it right now.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse.","Curt Woodworth","So, first question is just on working capital management. If I look at the last two years between accounts receivable and inventory, it's been about a $2.8 billion cash outflow, which I understand you're going to trend up just given what the pricing did and what's going on in the market, but it would seem that there is a significant opportunity to get working capital back out of the Company. I just wondered if you could address that given sheet pricing is back down basically to where it was a year ago.","Jim Frias","This is Jim. Let me answer that question. Our volumes of inventory and receivables didn't go up in terms of days on hand. They went up to commensurate with the volume of business that we are conducting. So, to the extent receivables went up, average prices were up. We are still collecting just over 30 days to collect our receivables. So, there's not a opportunity to shorten the collection of receivables, but you're right, if prices were to fall further, we get a benefit.","And in fact if you think back to 2015, we had a pretty weak earnings year as prices fell dramatically, but we generated very strong cash from operations because of working capital liquidation. And then, the inventory side of course when steel prices fall down, scrap prices fall down. So, the overall cost of all of our inventories gets lower and of course, we do low our volumes inventories a little bit when business activity is lower level.","So, yes, there is -- I mean, a severe downturn, there is an opportunity for some shrinking working capital. Now, if we look at what just happened in the first quarter, working capital was fairly neutral, whereas last year it was a drag on earnings of several hundred million dollars, maybe $600 million. So, what we're seeing right now is more of a stable environment for working capital, whereas last year it was building with expansion of margins.","Curt Woodworth","Right. But if I look at inventory days, you finished last year at 82, a year before that, you're at 73, 66, 57....","Jim Frias","Yes. We talked a little about this year and quarter there was a little bit of shipment delay with some of our customers at year end and there was also an issue with the supply chain, with raw materials. We were a little heavier than we wanted to be on pig iron, and so, we've been working that down -- working down a little bit, but it's not a huge opportunity. I would view it as still working capitals to be relatively flat as we go through the middle part of the year.","Curt Woodworth","Okay. And then just one follow-up on automotive. John, with some of the investments you're making on the galvanizing side, I know, the Company has already had pretty good success on gaining auto share. Can you just talk to your expectations for auto share growth with these new investments? I think you were targeting about 1 million tons of auto sheets either this year or last year and if you could just update us on sort of the amount of OEMs you're engaged with now versus a year or two ago that would be helpful. Thank you.","John Ferriola","Well we mentioned it in the earlier statements that we -- one of the markets that is declining as we go into this year is automotive. We expect it to be down somewhere around 16.8%, 16.9% level compared to 17.2% last year. But the good news is, we continue to grow our market share in the shrinking markets. We have a larger piece of a smaller pie.","You're right, a lot of the investments that we're making will continue to allow us to grow our market share in those areas, and specifically, I would mention the cold mill project at Hickman. I would mention the Gallatin expansion project, that's another one that's going to get us into automotive products.","So, going forward, we see our market share continuing to grow in automotive. You asked specifically about where do we see us currently, and we'll do about 1.6 million tons this year and by the end of the year, I think we'll be operating at a pace of about 2 million tons per year at an annual rate of about 2 million tons a year by the end of this year.","So, we're really excited about the penetration we made into automotive, you asked about what companies we are participating with, I'm not going to give specific names, but I will say that basically virtually all of the 14 OEMs we do business with today and we're really excited about that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners","So, I'm hoping you can help me connect the dots on the volume discussion we've been having. If I look at your Q1 volumes, just looking at the category, as you gave us, you got 5 million tons, and if I look at the first half of last year, it was 10.7, let's call it, but you're flat into the second quarter, then you are declining substantially year-over-year, but you told us that most of your end markets are going up nicely and auto will be flat. So, I'm just struggling with how to understand that. Is it something we're missing on the weather side, are customers not buying according to their demand? Can you help me understand that?","John Ferriola","Well, a couple of comments. The first one, Yes, your last point is exactly correct there is a lot of things going on in the market today, demand remain strong, but we see a lot of things happening. One example I would give you is that, a lot of the service center inventories are coming down quickly and they are getting to pretty low levels, and still a good amount of into sales between service centers, as they continue to work off the numbers from the end of last year. So you see some of that activity taking place, the weather, as I said, impacted the first half of the year, we see that's moving up now, as we go forward.","The other issue, I'd want to give you is, as you know, as we see scrap coming down, our customers tend to hold off, we need to see what's going to happen with the scrap. So there is, I believe -- personally I believe there's a lot of pent-up demand, people are waiting to see what's going to happen on scrap and in other areas, but remember the basics, demand continues to be good, imports continue to be lower than they were in last year and they continue to be down, year-over-year for certain.","So at some point, we do believe that we'll see the volumes start to pick up as we go through the second half of the year when we were talking about the overall volume being consistent year-to-year, that's overall the cost of the year, we think it will pick up in the second half. At the end of the day, I can tell you that as we said in the -- in the opening statement, we look at 24 end-markets, we talk to these customers all the time and they are very optimistic our customers are very optimistic about what's going on in the marketplace.","And the final point I would make is that some of our customers last year, they got a little bit heavy in their inventories because of hedge buying, they thought, they'd get ahead of the 232, they got some heavy loads there that is still working their way through. So a lot of things going on Timna, but at the end of the day, I look at markets, I look at what our customers are saying and frankly, one of the things that I would point out that I think is often missed, by the market and some analysts is, we participate in so many of the downstream markets that we sell into that we get a really good feel for what's happening in those markets.","Obviously, in rebar fabrication and Metal buildings and in Tubular. So, we being in those markets have a good sense of what's happening in those markets and we still feel optimistic about the demand that we see in those -- in those markets as well in our steel markets.","Timna Tanners","Okay, helpful, but maybe that...","John Ferriola","I don't know if that helped you connect the dots.","Timna Tanners","Yes, I mean, they helped, but I'm still of a confusion, I'm confused about the next area or maybe the same answer, but on price, so we've talked about volume, but on price, I'm not going to hopefully put you on the spot, but prices have been going down despite demand going up and more in the flat rolled side I recognized in some of the scrap, but why are domestic mills, I know, I have to repeat myself here, but why are the domestic mills charging at or below landed import prices if demand is so good and imports are down?","John Ferriola","You know, one of the reasons I would give you is that there are some start up mills, I'm not going to speak specifically to any competitor, but when you have new people coming back into the market they've got to earn their way into the market, sometimes I might even say, they've got to buy their way into the market. So we see some of that going on with new entries into the marketplace.","Obviously, when you start up a new mill or restart a mill, there's issues with some quality and deliveries and so forth, that force you to be a little bit lower priced again in the market where you're looking to gain, so that's such a drag onto the market, obviously and as I mentioned in the first part of the -- in my answer, scrap pricing going down, leads to an expectation by buyers that will be a better price tomorrow that there is today, so they hold back, that forces us to be a bit more -- little bit more responsible on pricing.","So, it's not always a case of pricing following exactly what's happening on the volumes and demand, but I will tell you that when you look at that relative to the fact that demand is strong, scrap pricing is going down, and even if steel pricing is going down, the metal margins we think are going to be good, maybe slightly improving as we go forward.","So again, we're still pretty optimistic about the market one of the things that I'm asked often is how do I compare this year to last year, and I answer by saying this is a full year, we're going to have a really good year. Will it be as good as last year? Maybe not, I'll tell you what, it's been a -- will be a lot better than most of the years we've had in the last ten years, that for sure, and it'll be a good year.","Timna Tanners","Okay, helpful. If I could just ask one last one, can you talk a little bit more about the raw materials segment, because I know in the last call, you had said that in the second half there are going to be some outages, so I had already adjusted for that, but now you're talking about a margin squeeze in DRI, and I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what's going on there and what the bigger picture is, I think if iron ore prices are going up, is it just a question of not being able to pass that through, or can you detail that a little more? Thanks.","John Ferriola","When you talk about our raw material side, you're talking about DRI specifically, I would assume, okay, and as the DRI plant in Louisiana, just to set everyone's mind that you said has been running very, very well, it's not been an issue with our operations there. The issue on performance is the fact that we sell DRI to our home mills, that's what the pig iron pricing is. Pig iron pricing has been coming down, so plus our selling price for the DRI, adjusted for value and use must be going down also.","So that's been the biggest impact in the first half. We did have a short outage, I think it was about 12 days where we had a valve fail, it was not a major issue, we did not have to take it offline and do all the things that we do it across weeks out of service. We did have a small outage of about 12 days, but that was not a significant impact to the -- it was basically the fact that pig iron pricing is going down, so DRI pricing is going down.","Now that's bad news on our DRI side, but bear in mind that we produce about 3.5 million tons of DRI, we buy about 3.5 million tons to 4 million tons of pig iron. So what we lose on the bananas, we kind of make up on the tomatoes a little bit. You know, and so it's a nice hedging situation where we do lose it on the DRI, but it's nice to get the better price on the -- on the pig iron.","Now, one more point you did mention in the second half, I do want to give everyone an update on that. We did mention that there will be a 60-day outage. It is going to be -- they're going to be down probably toward the end of August, middle to end of August and will be down for 60 days, it's going to make major repairs to our furnace vessel, to the control systems and to the refractory, to deal with the reliability issues that we've had in the past in those areas.","And there was one more major work that we have to do, which will be, toward the -- probably early next year and that will be on the material handling side. But right now, it's the -- as you know the big problem that we've always had is with the process gas heater and that's the major repair that we're making, a second issue we've had in the past probably the number two issue with reliability was our refractory, and we're also going to be doing -- redoing that during the 60-day outage.","And that's beginning of next year, and so we will not have a major impact to the operation, but we will be doing another large project on our material handling side to improve efficiencies.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Phil Gibbs","So question just to -- just to go a little bit further on what Timna was asking. So am I correct in looking at the profitability for the raw materials division as being $53 million including the $34 million gain. So the core number was about $20 million, but I think off of that number, you're saying that the results are going to be even weaker in the second quarter for the DRI business which would likely suggest DRI is going to be in a strongly negative or a loss position, and some of the quarters over the last several years, we've had some positives there, some we've had negatives and I know you're working to rectify that, but should -- should we be thinking that over the course of the cycle, given there will be times when iron ore is expensive and pig iron isn't like it is now, that this -- that this asset will be essentially just a cost center for you through the cycle?","John Ferriola","I'm not sure it'll be a cost center I think you said it more correctly at the beginning when you said as pig iron pricing changes goes up and down, then profitability of the DRI facility will go up and down. Again as I said earlier, one of the values and one of the reasons we did this was that it does provide a balance for us, a hedge for us against pig iron pricing when it starts to go up. So, yes, there will be times when the DRI pricing is under pressure, because pig iron pricing is under pressure, but also there will be times that it's reversed. So, it's a -- it's going to change as pig iron prices goes up and down.","Jim Frias","And John, it also keeps pressure on prime scrap prices and so we get to benefit there as well by having the pig iron there -- the DRI there, but yes, DRI did not perform as well in the first quarter as it did for most of last year, it'll probably perform slightly worse in the second quarter, but that's not so much about -- it's not about operations as John earlier said, it's really about pig iron prices and iron ore prices. Those are getting tighter. There's not as much spread to make money as there used to be.","Phil Gibbs","Is there availability issues in terms of the pellet supply stream, because I would assume you likely get some from Brazil and some from Europe, because that's where the main pellet suppliers are at. I mean are you seeing any tightness in supply right now or is that been something okay?","Jim Frias","It's definitely getting tighter. There's no doubt about that. You've heard about the problems that Vale has had, but you know remember that we are one of the largest buyers, okay, and we've had -- we are certainly a very reliable buyer and we are a reliable payer, okay, so we've had a long-term relationship with Vale and several other suppliers. So, although, there is a tightness we have not had any issue in getting what we needed to keep our operations running.","Operator","That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference over to John Ferriola for any additional closing remarks.","John Ferriola","So, let me close by saying, again, I want to express our appreciation to our shareholders, and say thank you to our customers. We firmly believe that together we can build powerful partnerships and get powerful results. And finally to my Nucor teammates as always, thank you for what you do for Nucor everyday and most importantly, thank you for doing it safely.","Thank you all for your interest in Nucor. Have a great day.","Operator","That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"16347":["Nucor Corp.

Please go ahead, sir.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. As always we appreciate your interest in Nucor.","With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team: Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias, and our other Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman, Dave Sumoski, and Chad Utermark.","The entire executive management team would like to thank everyone on our Nucor Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit Steel Technologies, and Skyline Steel teams for your excellent work taking care of our customers and implementing our company strategy for long-term profitable growth. Your hard work in these challenging market conditions is paying off.","First I will ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to review Nucor's third quarter performance and financial position. Following Jim's comments I will update you on the execution of our strategy for long-term profitable growth. Jim?","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thanks, John. Third quarter 2015 earnings of $0.71 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.50 per diluted share. Third quarter results included a LIFO credit that was approximately $0.11 per diluted share larger than anticipated in our guidance for the quarter, and a $0.03 per diluted share non-cash gain related to a correction of deferred tax balances.","Excluding LIFO and the tax related gain the third quarter outperformance resulted from better than expected results for the month of September at our steel mills and downstream products segments. We are benefiting from the effective execution of Nucor's channel-to-market strategy and our ongoing investments to expand our offerings of value-added products.","We are successfully expanding into these higher margined offerings using more demanding and import resistant applications, while at the same time maintaining our position as the low cost producer across our product portfolio.","The third quarter of 2015 performance of our raw materials segment included an operating loss at our new DRI facility in Louisiana of approximately $28 million, which included a $7.7 million net charge related to the write-off of the two remaining storage domes at the facility. That compared with a second quarter operating loss of about $20 million, which included the benefit of a vendor product warranty payment of approximately $10 million. As expected Nucor Steel Louisiana has now consumed the remaining higher cost iron ore inventory acquired in 2014.","In addition to continuing to produce DRI at world-class quality levels, our Louisiana team has realized significant improvements in yield, facility uptime and conversion costs. Nucor's DRI production capability in Louisiana and Trinidad puts our company in an unrivaled position of flexibility and optimizing our raw material costs through the cycle.","A quick comment of our tax rate to adjust for the impact of profits from non-controlling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners and the $10.2 million non-cash gain for correction of deferred tax balances, the effective tax rate was approximately 29% for the third quarter. Nucor continued to generate very robust operating cash flow in extremely challenging steel market conditions. With a highly variable and low cost structure we benefit from significant reductions in working capital during downturns. That was the case again in the first 9 months of 2015 with cash provided by operations of approximately $1.8 billion, a dramatic increase from the year ago period's operating cash flow of $926 million.","Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt to capital ratio was 36% at the close of the third quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $2 billion which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Our next significant debt maturity is not until December 2017. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until August of 2018. Nucor is the only North American steel producer to hold an investment grade credit rating.","Capital expenditures totaled $269 million for the first 9 months of 2015. We estimate full year 2015 capital spending will be approximately $400 million. Most of our recent larger scale organic investments have been completed or are nearing completion. Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to total about $700 million.","In September Nucor's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $900 million of our company's common stock. This replaced a repurchase program that had been in place since 2007. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The Nucor team places the highest priority on making sound capital allocation decisions that continue our long-term history of being effective stewards of our shareholders' investment.","Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 are expected to decrease compared to the third quarter of 2015, due to continued deterioration in global steel markets. A slowing economy in China is causing further global overcapacity and resulting in significant levels of imports into the domestic market. The performance of our downstream product segment is expected to decrease due to typical fourth quarter seasonality. We expect slightly lower performance in the raw materials segment due to lower scrap and metallic commodity prices.","We are encouraged by the ongoing gradual improvement in non-residential construction markets and the strength in the automotive market. We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable long-term growth. We do appreciate your interest in our company. John?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jim. Typical words used to describe current steel market conditions range from bleak to dismal. However those words in no way describe the attitude and outlook of the Nucor team. Even better those words also do not describe the performance of any of my teammates in the third quarter's extremely challenging environment. At Nucor we remain optimistic, determined, and focused.","Nucor's long-term success has always been driven by our team's unrelenting focus on a simple strategy. Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength to gain profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products. In short we work on what's under our control.","Anchoring the strategy and its execution is Nucor's business model. Its strength and adaptability is highlighted by a number of powerful building blocks. They include our culture, our robust balance sheet and cash flow generation, our low and highly variable cost structure, our flexibility and reliable production capabilities, our product diversity, and our leadership positions that we hold in many of the markets we serve.","Put together these competitive strengths provide Nucor with a powerful platform for delivering value to our customers. Challenging market conditions, as we face currently, only serve to increase the opportunities to add value and grow our long-term relationships with our customers.","What we call Nucor's five drivers to profitable growth highlight where we are focusing our energies to build long-term earnings power and provide our shareholders with attractive returns on their valuable capital. They are, one, enhance our position as a low cost producer. Two, achieve the market leadership position in every product line in our portfolio. Three, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher quality, more import resistant products. Four, expand our downstream channels to market to increase our steel mills base volume load, especially in weak markets. And five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional, operational strength.","Our third quarter performance provides strong evidence that our strategy of investing through the downturn is already paying off. Rather than being stuck in a defensive mode, fighting to survive, the Nucor team is on the offensive and growing stronger. The examples are numerous. Let me review a few of them for you.","Through the first 9 months of 2015 our rebar and merchant bar mills delivered year-over-year earnings improvement, despite the challenges of high imports and less than robust capacity utilization rates. The keys to their success are clear. They have built market leadership positions. Equally important they have established strong channels to market through Nucor's downstream joist, decking, rebar fabrication, cold finish bar, and fastener businesses by providing our steel mills the opportunity to earn a base level of volume. Our downstream vertical integration into value-added steel products significantly enhances the through the cycle profitability and flexibility of Nucor's core steel making business.","Additionally the downstream businesses are attractive profit generators for Nucor as well. All three major fabricated construction products \u2013 joists and decking, fabricated rebar, and metal buildings \u2013 achieved very strong profit growth year over year in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2015.","I'm pleased to report that our Vulcraft, Verco, joist and decking group set a single month profitability record in September. More importantly both our Vulcraft, Verco group and our metal buildings group achieved record performance for the third quarter of 2015.","The improved results of our fabricated construction products group is particularly impressive when you consider the state of the overall construction (13:31 \u2013 13:36) market. Forecasted U.S. non-residential construction activity for 2015, as measured by square footage, represents only about 60% of 2007's peak activity level, so there's plenty of room for additional growth. I would like to congratulate and thank our teammates for their hard work, reducing costs and providing world-class quality products and services to our customers.","Our beam mills also delivered attractive year-to-date earnings growth, while facing high import levels and low mill capacity utilization. Nucor's structural steel group's success is driven by a potent combination of its market leadership position, strong channels to market throughout our independent wide-flange beam fabricated partners, our Skyline Steel piling distribution business, and new product introductions that continue to move us up the value chain.","After completing last year's $115 million sheet piling product expansion project, our Nucor-Yamato mill is now enjoying strong marketplace success with its new, wider piling sections. These value added products are lighter and stronger, covering more area at a lower installed cost. Our Nucor-Yamato team is aggressively going after this market, which currently is largely supplied by imports. Our goal over the next several years is to grow our wider piling sections annual volume to 100,000 tons with these value added tons generating above average profitability.","Last month, Nucor-Yamato announced another project to expand its value-added offerings, a $75 million quench and self-tempering process will be installed with commissioning expected during the second half of 2016. This will give Nucor-Yamato the capability to produce A913 structural sections with a high-strength, low-alloy grade chemistry that provides excellent weldability, while achieving good toughness, even at low temperatures.","Common applications include gravity columns for high-rise buildings, long-span trusses for stadiums and convention centers, and for all projects where seismic design is a critical factor. These A913 beams allow the use of lighter foot weights, which reduces the weight and cost for the builder. That makes steel even more competitive versus concrete and wood. The low-alloy grade chemistry also enhances our position as a low cost producer of beams. As the sole North American supplier of high-strength, low-alloy beams, Nucor-Yamato will further enhance its market leadership position in wide-flange beams.","Nucor's focus on our drivers to profitable growth and resulting strategic investments are paying big dividends in our other businesses. This is particularly evident in the markets that are under the greatest pressure from the flood of imports and other challenges. Our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill achieved very solid third quarter and year-to-date profitability in what can only be described as horrific flat-rolled market conditions. The Berkeley team is capitalizing on its investments in vacuum degassing, combined with upgrades last year to its caster and hot mill. The mill's performance is being driven by its very diverse product mix, technical capabilities, and commitment to commercial excellence.","As we have discussed on previous calls, Berkeley now has the lightest hot-rolled gauge capability of any sheet mill in the southern U.S. market and with a finished steel capability of up to 74 inches. New products from the wide, light modernization are allowing us to gain new business in a range of end use markets, including metal buildings, railcars, water heaters, automotive, heavy equipment, and water transmission pipe.","Despite severe pressure from imports and demand weakness in several key end use markets, Nucor's engineered bar mills remain profitable. We are moving aggressively to utilize our recently expanded range of production and inspection capabilities to grow profitable market share in the SBQ and wire rod markets.","Our Memphis mill was recently awarded automotive crankshaft business that is a direct result of its quality inspection investments made since 2012. This week, Memphis announced another improvement, the very cost effective acquisition of a continuous quench and temper line with a separate annealing furnace capable of processing bar products from 2.5 inches to 11 inches in diameter. The addition of heat treating capabilities will enable Memphis to grow in a number of markets, including energy, heavy equipment, service centers, and automotive.","The automotive market continues to be an attractive growth opportunity for Nucor. Nucor's shipping rate into the automotive market increased by 20% in 2015 versus 2014 to a 1.4 million tons per year rate. Particularly encouraging is the volume of business that Nucor is being awarded on future automotive platforms. The automotive companies are more and more appreciating the value of Nucor's reliability, sustainability, and our financial strength.","Our portfolio of light weighting, advanced high-strength steels is also attracting a lot of interest. We remain optimistic about reaching our 2 million tons annual goal in the next few years.","Finally, our Darlington, South Carolina, facility's wire rod rolling mill continues to grow Nucor's market share in the wire rod market. Year to date rod shipments through the first 9 months are up 11% compared to 2014. Darlington's wire rod growth is also allowing us to more efficiently utilize the capacity at our other bar mills producing merchant bar and rebar products.","Since I have mentioned several times the challenging market conditions faced by all of our businesses, I will share my thoughts on what is by far the biggest factor driving the weakness. Illegally traded imports continue to have a significant impact on the U.S. steel industry. The underlying issue is global steel making overcapacity, resulting from the trade distorting practices of some governments. Steel imports into the U.S. market remain at historically high levels. The import levels are depressing the capacity utilization rates of the U.S. steel producers and continue to account for one-third of the U.S. market.","In the first 8 months of this year China's global steel exports surged 27% to 72 million tons. They are on track to exceed 100 million tons, which is greater than the total U.S. steel production last year. Steel products from China are flooding into markets around the world, creating a domino effect as countries look for markets for their steel products. The massive increase in China's steel exports are provoking a wave of trade actions across the globe, including Europe, South Africa, Mexico, and India, as steel producers fight against the illegally subsidized steel imports being dumped into their markets.","As these nations continue to successfully protect their markets from illegally traded and subsidized Chinese steel products, more of those products are being dumped into our market.","Recent decisions in several trade cases have been positive for the U.S. industry. The International Trade Commission has made preliminary determinations of injury in the cold-rolled, hot-rolled, and corrosion resistant sheet steel trade cases, allowing the investigation in all three cases to proceed.","Nucor will continue to assess market conditions in other product areas and aggressively pursue cases when appropriate. Our fight against illegally traded steel imports is essential to meeting our responsibility to be an effective steward of our shareholders' valuable capital.","These are challenging times. But for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength, these are also times for opportunistic action. And that is exactly what I see throughout Nucor. The right people focusing their unrivaled energy level and sense of urgency to achieving our goal of profitable growth. I have never been more confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us.","Thank you for your interest in Nucor. We would now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Congrats on a strong quarter. I think you kind of beat my number on pricing alone. Actually the volume number was a little bit weak. So it was \u2013 it kind of let me to believe that perhaps you're taking a pretty disciplined approach about which steel you actually want to sell into the market at this point and perhaps you may be walking away from some lower value sales that are head to head with imports.","So just kind of wanted to confirm that. And get a sense about how you think about selling into a weak market like this? And what that's doing to your mix? And then how does that kind of play into how you see operating rates in the fourth quarter?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well let me start by saying you hit the nail on the head with your analysis. We mentioned during my earlier comments that a key part of our strategic plan is to continue to grow market share in the higher quality, higher margin, more profitable products. And that's exactly what we've been doing. So, yes, that has some impact on our total output. The higher quality products, although they are more profitable, do tend to run slower on our mills. So that has some impact upon the amount of tons that we ship.","But you're spot on. We're looking hard at those products that we believe bring higher margins, higher profits to our company. And that are also more import resistant. Given the overcapacity in the world today, we believe that that's an important element of our long-term strategy.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And maybe just a question on trade. I've heard a couple conflicting views on how the process works. And I just wanted to try to clarify this. But obviously over the past couple of months in particular we've really seeing seaborne steel prices just absolutely get crushed. And clearly that data would be good to have in these trade cases as far as proving dumping. Is there an opportunity for the mills to go back and add some of this data before the final rulings come out at some point next year?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There absolutely is. In fact in some cases, as is the case with the rebar, we were not at all happy with the determination on the tariff that was applied to the product surging into our country from Turkey. And we're considering strongly going back and appealing that decision. And obviously we will use the pricing data that you just mentioned as a strong component in that appeal. So yes, we can use that information that's out there today. And we will use it effectively.","And I would just add to that that we spoke a little bit in the past about the recently passed legislation that strengthens the trade remedies that are available to us. And frankly giving us more effective tools for fighting against this illegally trade products. And we're really pleased with the way that that came out. We're very appreciative to the administration and to Congress for making that happen.","And those new regulations, those new guidelines will be applied to the trade cases that are in effect, going into effect now. The corrosion-resistant, the hot-rolled, and the cold-rolled will all be impacted by the new trade remedies that are currently in effect. And as a result we're optimistic as to the outcome of these. We think we have very strong cases, and we expect to have very positive results.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And just to clarify that just one more time, sorry if I'm being a little bit dense here. But the data that's coming out today, would you have to wait to appeal if you wanted to include that? So after the trade case is finalized. Or can you actually get that in maybe between the preliminary and the final ruling a little bit sooner?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well let me be clear. I might have confused the issue there for a minute. I was speaking in the case of rebar where there was a determination, we will be able to use that pricing data as we go back into the appeal. In the cases of cold-rolled and hot-rolled and corrosion-resistant we will be able to use that pricing data in these current cases. We will not have to wait for a determination and then use them in an appeal. They can be entered into the case as we press it forward.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very clear. Thank you very much.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Not now? Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matt Murphy with UBS.","Matt Murphy - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","Good afternoon. Maybe just a follow-up on the mix question there. So in particular I noticed cold finished was fairly low relatively to where you've been at in Q3 in past years and the same with plate. Just wondering if you can share any color on that? Is that specifically choosing not to compete on price? Or is there demand weakness?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In those two instances you just gave it's more of a case of the demand is frankly still pretty good relative to last year. Our demand across all of our products is about consistent, maybe down 2% or 3%. The issue that we're struggling with particularly on plate is the massive amount of illegally traded, unfairly traded products coming in from many countries, particularly Russia is one that I would mention in particular. So it's an issue of excessive supply as a result of imports.","There is a little bit of a demand decrease when you look at agriculture and in construction using heavy plate. So there's a little bit of a demand impact. But the real issue on plate without a doubt is the supply and the oversupply as a result of the imports.","Matt Murphy - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","Thanks. And then just a follow-up on the structural pricing. That was another area I noticed that had come down a bit faster in Q3. How are you seeing structural pricing going forward? Is it sliding? Or do you think you can keep it stable?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We think structural pricing going forward will be fairly stable.","Matt Murphy - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","That's easy. Okay. Thanks.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matthew Korn with Barclays.","Matthew James Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Matthew James Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So I'm wondering, are there any customers \u2013 any buyers from whom you've received orders for maybe the first time in a while? Who are shifting away from imported steel in anticipation of the effect of trade cases? And on the flipside are there any buyers out there who have told you, right now we're good. Inventories are okay. I'm seeing this gap down in scrap prices and I kind of see to \u2013 I need to see where we're going to shake out coming into the New Year?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well you've asked two questions. And the answer to both of them frankly is yes. We are seeing customers coming back to us, who are recognizing that right now their inventories are a little bit bloated. So we don't see them pouring in right now with new orders.","But we are hearing from them that because of the trade cases and frankly because our pricing has become much more competitive relative to imported pricing, that they have not placed the orders for imports to the same level that they have in the past. And as you know when you're talking about import orders, there's about a 2-month to 3-month, maybe 4-month sometimes depending upon the product, delay or a lag time between when the order was placed and when product arrives.","So many of our service center customers in particular are recognizing that the orders that they placed 2 months, 3 months, 4 months ago now do not look nearly as attractive. And unfortunately they're on the water, they're on the way, and they can't be cancelled.","So we're going to see this issue of heavy inventories continue for a little bit of time. But ultimately we do believe that because we're more competitive today and because they have seen some other issues with lead times from the imported products, we'll be able to regain that business. We see our customers coming back to us from the imports.","The other comment that I'll make just in general, you asked about other customers coming back to us. We're also seeing many new customers approaching us, because they see Nucor as a company with a very strong financial position and sustainable. They know we're going to be here for the long term. And there's some other companies that might be a little bit more challenged, particularly if this challenging time continues for another quarter or 2 quarters. So the answer to your question is yes, and the answer to your question is yes.","Matthew James Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Very helpful. Let me follow-up with that really quickly and just say look, the details of the organic product and the capacity development that you're doing, that's great. How are you thinking about use of available capital in terms of M&A? Is there any sense of look, we're in strong financial shape, especially relative to the group. We're expecting the bottom to come in sooner than later. Let's get active. Let's find other assets. Let's tuck-in some more downstream facilities. Is that \u2013 where's your thinking there?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I'm going to answer that in a more general sense, and talk about how we view what we're doing with our cash. We have been a strong cash generator. This is not a very good year in terms of cash generation from operations. And certainly acquisitions would be one thing that we will look at.","But in a more general sense when I think about the deployment of our cash going forward, our first priority will always be aggressive growth, profitable growth in our company. And that can be done several ways. Organic growth has been for us one of the ways that we get the largest returns for the investments that we've made. And you've heard us list today and in the past conference calls numerous projects, in which we are growing our company profitably through organic investments in our existing operations.","Frankly, acquisitions is another way that we are deploying our cash to accomplish profitable growth. Skyline would be an example of that. Fairly recent \u2013 more recent than that would be our Gallatin acquisition.","So yes. We're looking at that. It's a way to not only grow our volumes, but to grow our customer base and grow the breadth of our products. And that's something that's very important as we look potential targets out there.","And I take this opportunity to just remind you of one other way that we can grow our company through investments. And that's we got a pretty good track record of growing through greenfield expansion. And I know that there's a lot of overcapacity. And everybody is lifting their eyebrows and rolling their eyes when I say that, but we are constantly looking for unique market opportunities or product niches, in which we can grow our \u2013 through greenfield expansion.","Matthew James Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Excellent. Thanks for the time and good luck for the next quarter.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hey, good afternoon.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So I also wanted to follow-up if I could on the cash level, because it is the highest that you've had since 2009. And that was maybe hunkering down. So I guess I just wanted to know is that preparing for restocking? Does the message about your reauthorized buyback program send a signal? Or just I know there's a lot of uses of cash. I'm just wondering, this is a pretty big cash hoard even for you. So I just wondered if you could provide any priorities of how you're thinking about using them if you could?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I've mentioned that the number one priority is to profitably grow our company. And that will always be our first priority.","In terms of building up a large cash reserve or a war chest, how are we looking at that, I don't think that we're really looking at it as a need to be able to grow our inventories, our working capital as the businesses get better. That's really not \u2013 that is not what is driving it. The opportunity for opportunistic buys as we go forward, again as this challenging time extends out, there might be opportunities, as we've done in the past, to pick up some very good assets at a very good price.","You know, Timna, that one our strategies has always been to grow our company during the downturns when assets are less expensive. So we think that that's going to be happening as we go forward. We think there's going to be more assets available at good prices. We want to make sure that we're prepared to capitalize on those opportunities. So we have that. And that's one of the reasons that we're making sure that we preserve our cash.","Now to your questions about dividends and buyback programs, I'll make just a couple of comments. Now first of all as you know we pay a very health dividend today. And we've proven in the past that when our profit levels are such that we could pay out a supplemental dividend without adversely affecting our ability to aggressively grow and profitably grow our company, we'll do it. Right now that's not the case.","And in terms of the buyback, what we did was we asked our board to authorize a buyback program that was, frankly, in place, so really just refreshing a program that had already been authorized and had been on the books for many years. We did that. We want to be prepared for a situation where there might be limited, profitable growth opportunities that do not provide a large enough return that would outweigh the repurchasing of our stock. In other words when we take a look at the opportunities in front of us, we want to make sure that the return that we gain from those acquisitions, those investments, surpass what we would gain for our shareholders by repurchasing the stock. If that's not the case, we want to be ready. If that situation should come up suddenly, we want to be ready.","One thing about this industry, Timna, as you know, it changes. And when change occurs, it occurs rapidly. And we made this move just so that we're ready for that eventuality.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. No doubt. There's a lot of assets in mining if you decide to branch out there. So not making a suggestion, just saying.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well and I'll just pick up on that suggestion for a minute, not respond to it directly. But one of the things that you have to remember about our company, we have such a broad portfolio of businesses, such a large portfolio of upstream, core businesses, our downstream. If you look at our various businesses we have about 12 businesses that provide an opportunity in which we can invest. That's a large number of opportunities and it spans a very broad spectrum of opportunity.","So as I look at the situation going forward, we can see opportunities both upstream, core business, and downstream. And we want to make sure that we're ready. We think they're going to be coming available as this \u2013 as people struggle to get through this challenging time. And we want to be positioned to take advantage of that, to capitalize on that.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I wanted to ask, if I could, about the \u2013 my second question would be about the raw material segment. And I cringe to ask this, but I know that you're probably not delighted to be reporting losses in the segment. And I know that DRI was looking a lot better positioned when met coal prices were much higher. But what are you thinking about doing to fix that segment and reverse it, or is it just strategic, and you're okay with losses there for now?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well as we've said many times that our DRI investment is a investment for the long term. And that we recognized and we recognized right from the beginning that there's going to be pricing situations in raw materials, in which the DRI investment is going to be a single and times when it's going to be a home run and times when it's going to be a grand slam.","But the other point that I would make is that we always look at our investments for the long term. And when you look at the macro impact reasons for making the investment, the fact that manufacturing is leaving the country and with it prime scrap. When you look at long term, we still believe that the availability and the pricing for natural gas will be much more attractive than that for coking coal. When you look at the improvement in the efficiency of automotive blanking, which results in less prime scrap availability, even in periods where the automotive market is very strong. For all of these reasons, as we look long term, we believe that having the ability to produce a low residual scrap substitute product for Nucor is going to be a very good investment.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And if I may, Timna, what \u2013 if I can, which is I let you ask a second question, maybe you can make me \u2013 let me make a second statement about this response.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And that's one thing that we \u2013 I don't know that we emphasize enough when we talk about the DRI project and what it does for us. And that gives us \u2013 it's that it gives us tremendous flexibility in our selection of raw material use for our currencies (44:11).","And by using that flexibility we're able to impact other scrap or other iron unit products. And that has been very beneficial to us. I mean you saw \u2013 you've seen the impact of that a couple of months ago when we saw such a tremendous drop in scrap.","And I would also suggest to you that whenever we put in or take out 4 million tons of a scrap substitute product, it's going to have an impact on other iron unit products. It's just going to have an impact. So it gives us tremendous flexibility and the ability to better utilize our scrap mix to enhance our low cost position as a steel supplier.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Jorge Beristain with DB here. I had a question about the bar volumes that we saw decline sequentially, 8% quarter on quarter, even exceeding that of sheet. Could you give some color as to what's happening in bars? Obviously we know that energy has been weak. But are there any other end markets that bars would be going into that would account for that kind of sequential weakness?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well again you hit the nail on the head. Certainly energy, in which a lot of our special bar quality products go into energy. That has taken a tremendous hit. We mentioned earlier, agricultural. That has been way down. And of course we have a lot of product, bar products, long products going into agriculture. So that's another area where we've seen a declining market. And finally I would say heavy equipment. And the heavy equipment market is down.","And once again I'm going to go back to my favorite subject, and that's of unfairly traded imports, because when you look at particularly rebar, the tsunami of unfairly traded rebar into this country over the last year has been \u2013 it's just totally unacceptable. And it has had a tremendous impact upon our volume and our profitability in that area in our bar products.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And maybe just following up on Timna's question earlier about your raw material segment. Could you just give us some color as to the sort of quarter-on-quarter deterioration that we saw? You had pointed to an improvement in DRI. So are we to assume that it's really deterioration in the scrap purchasing there that's bringing down the results? Or can you give us just some color as to what's going on there?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I don't have the exact number in my head for the amount that scrap has gone down over the quarter. But I can tell you that there has been recent movements that over the quarter \u2013 what would you say, Joe? How much has it been down over the quarter, scrap pricing?","R. Joseph Stratman - Executive Vice President","Scrap pricing over the quarter has dropped about $70.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","$50 to $70. And when you have that kind of a scrap price drop, it certainly has an impact on our scrap operations. So yes, we've seen improvement in our DRI performance and the performance of our DRI plant. But the raw material has suffered as a result of the \u2013 our scrap operations.","R. Joseph Stratman - Executive Vice President","And just to be clear, Jorge, this is Joe Stratman, the recycling scrap processing side of our business is where that would be. On the brokerage and services side that metallics pricing really doesn't affect a lot of the margin or profitability in that sector.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Michael.","Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon. Hi. How are you? Just I wanted to...","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","(48:14)","Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good, good. I wanted to follow-up on one of your comments earlier on trade in terms of someone was asking about putting recent numbers into the trade case decision. Since the coated antidumping, this preliminary decision was pushed back from November to I think December 21. I mean what is the time period in which they'll be looking at data? From what to what period?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well as a general statement they're looking at data today. But frankly it'll be mostly into December, into the first quarter where they'll be doing their analysis. We do expect to have some kind of a rulings on the coated sometime in the first quarter. And probably hot-rolled and cold-rolled would be a little bit later than that. Towards \u2013 some time towards the latter part of the first quarter in terms of getting the final determinations. Is that what you're asking?","Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well I was saying that the \u2013 I thought the preliminary decision on the first case, the coated case, was due out on December 21. And I'm just asking, there must be some period of time in which they look at data to decide what the decision is.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well first of all \u2013 if you're asking is that data being considered now? Is that's the question? I'm sorry I'm not following you.","Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well is current data, current market activity right now being considered in the decision?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Yes.","Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And when do they cut off? Okay we're going to stop looking at data and we're going to \u2013 for the decision?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well remember that we get to testify during the final argument so to speak before the determination is made. Clearly we will bring up pricing today, pricing between now and the time of the hearings and the final \u2013 excuse me, the testimony in the final hearings. And all of that will be submitted and be considered.","Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","But you're still expecting the preliminary coated decisions on anti-dumping to be out as they're saying right now on December 21? Or are you saying you think it's going to be later?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's actually just the \u2013 for the AD case it's actually December 30 to be specific. And for the countervailing duty case it has been extended out to November 2.","Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And last question just again on trade. Are there any similarities between now and back at the end of 2001 in the Chinese hot-rolled case, where Chinese have basically been locked out of hot-rolled since then with a 90% tariff?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There are some similarities. And actually the way that it differs is that the amount of hot-rolled and all steel products that China is exporting today, compared to where it was back then, has increased by a magnitude of I don't know, 10 [times], 20 [times], 30% \u2013 times rather. It's just unbelievable.","But they're talking about exporting. I think the number year to date that's coming out of China somewhere around 72 million tons year to date. It's expected to go up to over 100 million tons this year. Bearing in mind that the entire U.S. market is 100 million tons, that's a ridiculous amount to be exported out of one country. And it's a direct consequence of their building a tremendous amount of overcapacity in China.","So yeah, there's some similarities in the sense that they're flooding the market today. They flooded the market then. And we will be aggressive in pursuing cases against them today as we were back in 2000.","Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, John.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Lane with Morningstar.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Research","Hi, good afternoon. First, could you provide some color as to the integration of Nucor Steel Gallatin? Given that it was about a year ago around this date that the acquisition was completed, has the contribution of Gallatin fallen in line with your expectations? And then also in terms of the virgin iron units at Gallatin, are those being supplied via imported material or via DRI produced in-house?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well first of all I have to say no to the first part of your question. The integration is not going as we expected it to go. Frankly it's going much, much better. And we knew going into that \u2013 into the acquisition that we had a lot of similarities in our culture. And clearly cultural compatibility is very high on our list of targets that we look to acquire.","And all I can say \u2013 and I hope our teammates in Gallatin are listening \u2013 those guys have done a great job coming up to speed. They are doing a great job of integrating and simulating into the Nucor culture. We share a lot of similar cultural traits. And in one area frankly \u2013 and I want to thank them for this. In one area they helped us get a whole lot better. And that was in the area of safety. Safety performance before the acquisition was outstanding, their commitment to working safe is phenomenal. And the way they run their safety programs is phenomenal. And we've learned quite a bit from them.","So despite the fact that Gallatin is operating today in an extremely tough market. The energy, which is a big product coming out of Gallatin, as you know has been really, really challenged. But our teammates are doing what we always do at Nucor, and that is finding new ways, new products. One example would be that they are working hard to qualify for automotive products. And we expect them to be successful in that attempt. And all I can say is it is without a doubt going much better than we anticipated.","And one other comment to your question about the where are they getting their raw materials from? Obviously on the scrap side there's a lot of synergies with our DJJ operations right up the road is River Metals (55:00). And in scrap substitutes today, they are taking scrap substitutes in. We are working to modify the plant so that it can accept DRI out of our Louisiana plant. And we expect that to be up and running some time the end of next year, first part of 2017, the DRI.","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","16 months to 18 months.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Somewhere around 16 months to 18 months.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Research","Okay great. Thanks. And then as a second question could you provide an update on where you stand with the high cost iron ore inventory position you've been digesting at the Louisiana DRI facility? And then what portion of the $28 million of losses at Nucor Steel Louisiana were driven by that particular factor during the quarter?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well let me start off by saying that this is the second time in your one question where you've made me smile. Question about Gallatin made me smile about how well that has gone. And I'm smiling now, because I can tell you we have completely digested the higher cost iron ore. We've worked our way completely through that.","And so the second part of your question was of the $28 million loss in the quarter. Now first of all I would suggest that the number is actually closer to...","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","$20 million.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","$20 million because of the impact. Jim, you want to jump in on the impact of the $7 million?","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. We had some raw material iron ore storage domes that we made a decision that we were not going to continue to use. And so we had an asset write-down for I think just under $8 million.","But, John, I think his question is of the $20 million loss, how much was driven by higher cost iron ore. And I don't think we have that number...","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No.","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","...at our finger tips.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We don't have that number. I don't think.","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","But they did finish using the iron ore that was on hand.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","There might be a little trace amount left, but not anything notable.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And I \u2013 one of the things that if you'll \u2013 another reason why I'm smiling to be honest with you is that our Louisiana plant was cash positive for the last 2 months, and that's a significant improvement. Now they will continue to be challenged given the current pricing of raw materials in general. That's going to be a challenging operation for a while. As I said earlier we don't expect it to be a grand slam in this pricing environment. But long term we have a great deal of confidence that it was a good investment and will pay large dividends over the long run.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Research","Much appreciated. Congrats on a solid quarter.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, good afternoon.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","A question on the automotive business and just want to understand where we are in terms of the kind of the absolute tonnage penetration? And maybe if you could give us a breakout of products within that number, whether it be cold finish bar, hot band, SBQ, cold rolled? Just kind of a general thought process here. And then how you're looking to grow that market going forward?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That's a great question. It's an area that we're very proud of the way that we've been able to grow that business. When you ask about specific shipment rates, in 2015 we are on track to ship at a rate of about 1.4 million tons a year. And that's about a 20% improvement over where we were last year.","In terms of a breakdown between sheet and cold finish, today about 85% of our products going into automotive are in sheet products, and 15% coming out of some form of SBQ or cold finish. And in terms of where we want to go the sky is the limit ultimately. But over the next 2 years to 3 years we are confident that we will be able to grow that business to a rate of about 2 million tons of shipments per year going into automotive.","Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. I \u2013 2 million [tons] is what you said. Okay. I appreciate that. And then...","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We want grow it to 2 million [tons]. Okay? Over the next 2 years to 3 years. Beyond that we will continue to grow in that market, as we will continue to grow in all high quality, higher valued, and more import resistant products.","Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just in terms of what your feelers are out there on non-residential construction and what those are telling you. What's the read at this point in time? Just noticing the fabrication, I think volumes were down a little bit year on year. Any sense of why that's the case? Just trying to get a better feel for your view of non-res and what your indicators are telling you right now.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I would start off by saying that we do think that the rate of growth in non-residential construction as we measure it in square footage has slowed. At the beginning of the year we were anticipating somewhere about an 8% or 9% growth over the course of the year. Today, we would say that that number is probably closer to 5% or 6% today. So we do see the rate of increase, the rate of growth, slowing as the year has progressed.","Now, when I look at our business in particular, Nucor's business and our downstream businesses, what's frankly going to the non-residential construction. And we're feeling pretty good about our backlogs. Our backlogs today in all three of our downstream businesses \u2013 Vulcraft, Verco, building systems, and Harris \u2013 our backlogs are the largest they have been, the strongest they have been in a 10-year period. And when you couple that with the profitability that we talked about earlier, we've had a very good quarter for our downstream businesses. Although we see the rate of improvement slowing, we still feel pretty good about our downstream businesses and their ability to compete in the construction market.","Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Well in terms of the shipments, John, was that year-over-year comparison a bit negative because maybe there was some overbuying in Q1, and you need a quarter to level that out?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yeah.","Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Because your backlog is pretty strong from what you're saying right now?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And it's hard to take a look at \u2013 that's a business that \u2013 those projects are long-term projects, some of them spanning several years. So as you look at the length of time, it becomes cyclical. The order entry rate becomes cyclical. The shipping rates will become cyclical. So it's hard to look at any one particular quarter and compare it to another particular period of time. You've got to really look at the overall order entry rate and the backlogs. And that's what we use to track how we see the business performing.","Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then I have one high level political\/philosophical question, and then I'll jump off. I guess first your thoughts on a long-term highway bill, and if you see any light at the end of the tunnel there. And then in terms of the TPP are you (1:02:35 \u2013 1:02:37) concerned if that's \u2013 are you concerned if that measure is passed without any further safeguards like FX manipulation? Thanks.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well I'll start with that one. But I would like to address both of them. We are absolutely concerned about TPP passing in its present form. Now, remember we all, all of us, have not yet gotten a chance to take a look at the complete document. So I'm not going to say whether or not we would favor it or we would struggle with it, until we have an opportunity to read and study the entire document, which we have not had at this time.","That said, I will say that we are extremely, extremely disappointed that it's not \u2013 that currency manipulation is not more strongly baked into that agreement. At the end of the day you can have all kinds of trade agreements and if a country manipulates its currency, it's guaranteed to have an unfair trade advantage.","And so we have \u2013 what we are insisting upon with TPP is that it does, as it's promising to do, and that is to provide a more level playing field, on which we can compete. We at Nucor are absolutely convinced that if we were given a level playing field to compete upon, we would compete successfully against any company or any country in the world.","So we're taking a hard look at TPP before we come out with a definitive statement, but you are absolutely correct in saying that currency manipulation not being a part of that agreement makes us really struggle about the impact it will have on our company, the impact it'll have on our industry, the impact it'll have on manufacturing in the United States, and the impact most importantly that it'll have upon middle class Americans working hard to make a living and to make a better life for themselves and their family. So you got a little philosophical. So did I. Okay?","Now to infrastructure. Once again I have to say that I'm disappointed in the administration and frankly in Congress in not taking advantage of what I consider a great opportunity. Right now, steel costs are down. What a time to focus on rebuilding our infrastructure. Okay? Energy. Okay? How important is energy in our \u2013 going forward in a manufacturing world and for our country frankly? What a great time to be able to rebuild our energy infrastructure, our power grids.","And frankly, with the price of oil where it is today and the resulting price of gasoline at the pump, it seems to me like this would be a great time to be able to \u2013 and I know this is politically unpopular, but I'm not running for office so I can say it. Okay? This would be a great time to just put a little bump onto the tax of the tax rate on gasoline and use that money to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure of this country.","What an embarrassment. 30 years, 40 years, 50 years ago, we were \u2013 our country was known for its infrastructure. People came here to study how we build bridges. And today you look at it. And overall our bridges, our infrastructure as a whole just recently received a D-plus. And they were bragging on the fact that it wasn't really D, it was D-plus. Okay?","We don't need infrastructure \u2013 if we're going to have a manufacturing powerhouse in the 21st century, we need infrastructure that gets an A-plus, not a D-plus. This is a great opportunity to rebuild our infrastructure. I'm extremely disappointed that we continue to kick the can down the road on funding with three-month extensions after extension after extension. I believe that there's something like 33 or 34 three-month extensions since 2008. That's an embarrassment. And I really hope that our leaders step up to the plate and do not miss this great opportunity to rebuild the infrastructure in this country.","Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, John. Amen.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead.","Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good afternoon, John, Jim. Just piggybacking off Phil's question earlier on the auto side. With the growth to 2 million tons is that related for equipment upgrade and qualifications or is that more marketing in terms of you're getting Nucor product onto the next auto build?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well clearly, the way that we have been able to grow our automotive presence has been through investments in our company. The vacuum-tank degassers throughout all of our sheet mills, the wide, light project at Berkeley that \u2013 the work that we've done and the advances that we have made in our advanced high strength steels, those have opened the doors for us in growing our automotive presence.","And I also have to say that the automotive companies recognizing the long-term sustainability of Nucor and the quality and service that we've been able to provide for them, have attracted them and given us the opportunity to grow in those areas.","In terms of your specific question relative to how we see it growing over the next 2 years, the answer to that would be a yes. We're basing that upon qualifications that we've already \u2013 have been through and have passed and qualified for applications in future platforms and commitments that have been made to us on future platforms. So we are confident in that projection of 2 million tons to 3 million tons.","I would also add just one more thing on that is you mentioned the commercial and marketing. We recognize the need to improve our marketing into automotive. And to that end we've established a sales office right in Detroit. It's the first time Nucor has had a sales office located in Detroit. We've named a sales manager to oversee automotive specifically. And this is an extremely experienced guy with a lot of years in the service.","And again we're confident that we will be able to commit the \u2013 we will be able to fulfill the commitment that I'm making to you and that our commercial team has made to me that we will get to 2 million tons over the next 2 years to 3 years.","Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks for the detail. And then second one, on natural gas, I know you guys have stopped drilling with Encana there for a couple years. Could you give us an update on how you're positioned there? With the wells declining how are you looking at 2016? Any need or desire to hedge out your gas exposure?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right now given the pricing that we're seeing in natural gas and that we expect to continue through 2016, we don't see any significant change in our drilling program. There might be a couple of wells that we might have to drill in order to maintain the leases on the property. And we would want to do that. We've got some great property there, and we want to maintain the leases on those properties. But frankly I don't see us changing our drilling program at this time.","And in terms of hedging we feel confident that we see natural gas pricing remaining low for at least next year. And so we're pretty comfortable with our gas positions.","Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Is there a meaningful earnings impact from those wells decline...","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Can you repeat that? I didn't catch the last part of that.","Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. With gas at $2.40, $2.50, I'm wondering how does that compare with your share of the offtake from those natural gas wells? And as those wells decline and produce less, and you're buying more from the open market, is there a perceivable difference in the cost of the two that we could see an earnings impact?","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","The wells are incurring a very small loss right now, but they're actually cash flow positive. So it's not meaningful.","Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","John J.

","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Ferriola, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Nucor Corporation. Please go ahead.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call and for your interest in Nucor. Other members of Nucor's executive team are also on the call today, including Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Joe Stratman, our Chief Digital Officer; Craig Feldman, responsible for Raw Materials; Ladd Hall, responsible for Sheet and Tubular Products; Ray Napolitan, responsible for Engineered Bar Products; Dave Sumoski, responsible for Merchant Bar and Rebar Products; Leon Topalian, responsible for Beam and Plate Products; and Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated Construction Products.","I will begin today's call by sharing with you the highlights from our third quarter. Jim Frias will then provide you more details about our financial performance. ","Nucor's strong financial performance continued into the third quarter with net earnings of $2.13 per diluted share and first nine months earnings of $5.35 per diluted share. We are on pace in 2018 to have a record year for earnings. ","Our financial results are evidence that Nucor was primed and ready for this long-awaited upturn in the steel market. Our strategic initiatives, including capital projects, acquisitions and enhanced customer engagement as well as our active participation in industry trade actions have solidified our market-leading performance. Our extensive investments have grown our peak earnings power and enhanced our many competitive strengths. Our growth and earnings capacity has been achieved in all three of our business segments: steel, downstream products and raw materials. These diverse earnings streams power our long-term, industry-leading returns on capital. ","The continued strength of the U.S. economy is the primary catalyst for our earnings growth. Tax and regulatory reform, along with a robust domestic energy sector, are driving this economy. 23 of the 24 end-use markets we monitor are experiencing stable to increasing demand. During the fourth quarter, we continued to see evidence of sustained strength in steel end-use markets. ","Our industry is also benefiting from the cumulative impact of years of successful trade cases that resulted in antidumping and countervailing duties as well as the very recently imposed Section 232 tariffs. Together, these are removing artificially low-cost foreign imports from the market and restoring a level playing field. ","Through the first nine months of 2018, finished steel imports are down approximately 11%. Finished steel import market share for this year's first nine months is 24%, down from 28% for the comparable year-ago period. Nucor's earnings growth is supported by our disciplined capital allocation practices. ","Our highest priority is to invest in profitable, long-term growth. We are currently implementing nine growth initiatives totaling approximately $2.2 billion. Completion dates for these projects range from 2019 through 2021. Four of these projects, totaling $750 million, are focused on the production of long products. These include the rebar rolling mill modernization in Ohio, the MBQ mill expansion in Illinois and the construction of two new rebar micro mills, one in Missouri and the other in Florida.","Notable third quarter progress on these important growth projects included the successful startup of the new reheat furnace at the Ohio rolling mill modernization and completion of environmental permitting for the Missouri rebar micro mill. The remaining five projects, totaling $1.4 billion, are in our Sheet Mill group. They include a specialty cold rolling mill and additional galvanizing line in Arkansas, a galvanizing line in Mexico with our joint venture partner, JFE Steel, and a new galvanizing line and expanded hot band production capacity in Kentucky. ","Two of the projects are approaching completion in the first half of 2019, the Kentucky mill's new galvanizing line and the Arkansas mills specialty cold mill. The Gallatin, Kentucky project will position Nucor with the widest hot-rolled galvanizing line in North America and significantly boost our growth in automotive markets. The Hickman, Arkansas project expands our capability to produce advanced high-strength, high-strength low-alloy and motor lamination products. ","Let me share further details regarding our recently announced expansion of hot band production capacity at Nucor Steel Gallatin. The mill's current capacity is 1.6 million tons annually, which we are expanding to 3 million tons. The cost of the project is about $650 million. When completed, Gallatin will have the capability to produce bigger slabs, casting up to 5 inches and a maximum coil width of up to 73 inches. ","The project advances our move up the value chain by giving Nucor Steel Gallatin access to approximately 6 million tons of higher value-added applications in the energy pipe and tube, heavy equipment and automotive markets. It is very important to understand that we do not add capacity simply to ship more tons. Our investments are targeted to capitalize on opportunities to move up the value chain and expand our product offerings and to leverage our cost advantages in logistics and technology. ","Profitable growth is always Nucor's objective. And Nucor team's focus is on delivering higher returns on our invested capital by taking care of our customers with unrivaled value proposition among steel producers.","Now I'll update you on our progress at our Louisiana DRI facility. In early 2018, the team at our Nucor Steel Louisiana facility began implementation of a three-pronged strategy to increase the plant's reliability and uptime. The plan focuses on achieving improvements in people, process and equipment. The work in the areas of people and process have yielded great results. Production for the first nine months of 2018 by Nucor Steel Louisiana of approximately 1.3 million metric tons is more than 50% ahead of the prior year's first nine months and actually exceeds full year of 2017 output.","Equipment improvements are the next critical step in achieving sustained reliability at the plant. Our capital plan will invest approximately $200 million in equipment and process improvements, including the process gas heater and a new raw material storage yard. The bulk of the work is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019. ","With Louisiana's DRI product quality already at world-class levels, we look forward to achieving world-class reliability at Louisiana comparable to that achieved by Nucor's DRI facility in Trinidad. Earlier this year, our new IN team in Trinidad established a record of 137 days of continuous operation, a feat no other Midrex mega module plant in the world has achieved. ","We recognize that as the landscape in the steel industry continues to change, we must continue to be responsive to our customers' needs and provide them with the very best commercial experience. That is why we are excited about the progress of our new digitalization initiative, which is a critical component of our drive to achieve commercial excellence.","We are currently deploying two new digital tools: Nucor Now, a new customer web portal; as well as an enhanced EDI system to enable improved direct digital connections with our customers. These new digital tools will bring together consistent information from all of our steelmaking divisions into one virtual location, making it easier for our customers to do business with us versus going to multiple mills and multiple websites. ","We would like to thank many of our customers who have given has their input and have allowed us to work with them in furthering this effort. As with all things Nucor does, we will continue to improve and refine them so that they meet our customers' evolving needs. We believe this is a big step forward for us to modernize our direct digital connections with our customer base.","Now Jim will provide more specific detail about our third quarter performance and financial position. Jim?","James Frias","Thanks, John. Nucor reported third quarter of 2018 earnings of $2.13 per diluted share. Our results included a noncash impairment charge of $0.26 per diluted share after-tax related to Nucor's investment in proved producing natural gas well assets. Excluding this charge, third quarter 2018 earnings were at the high end of our guidance range of $2.35 to $2.40 per diluted share, which did not include any estimate for the impairment, as noted in Nucor's September 14 news release. ","Impressive earnings growth through the first nine months of 2018 has been achieved across our broad portfolio, including engineered bar, merchant bar and rebar, plate steel, structural steel, flat rolled, tubular products, joist and deck, metal buildings, cold finished bars and our raw materials businesses. Teammates throughout your company have worked hard to position Nucor for the strong conditions we are experiencing. We are encouraged by our results so far in 2018, and our focus remains on continuing to deliver the substantial payoff we expect from wisely investing our shareholders' valuable capital.","Our 2018 earnings are also benefiting from the tax reform legislation that became effective this year. Excluding earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, Nucor's effective tax rate was 24.2% for the third quarter and 23.4% for the first nine months of 2018. ","All of this has translated into exceptionally strong cash flow. Through just the first nine months of this year, your company generated approximately $1.9 billion of cash from operating activities or almost $6 per diluted share. As a result, Nucor's financial position remains strong. ","With total debt outstanding of approximately $4.3 billion, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 29.6% at the end of the third quarter of 2018. Nucor's robust liquidity includes cash holdings of $1.9 billion at the close of the third quarter as well as our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023.","For 2018, we continue to estimate capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion. Approximately 2\/3 of planned 2018 capital spending is for expansion, product improvement and cost savings projects, with the remaining 1\/3 for maintenance purposes. ","Depreciation and amortization for 2018 is estimated to be approximately $730 million. Based on currently approved projects, we would expect 2019 capital expenditures to be higher than in 2018. We are not in a position to provide a dollar estimate for that today. ","In addition to investing for profitable, long-term growth, Nucor continues to deliver attractive cash returns to our shareholders. In the first nine months of 2018, Nucor returned $716 million to shareholders, with cash dividends of $365 million and share repurchases of $351 million. The share repurchases total approximately 5.4 million shares at an average cost of about $65 per share. Year-to-date 2018 capital returns are consistent with our target to return 40% of through-the-cycle earnings to shareholders. ","For the fourth quarter of 2018, we continue to see sustainable strength in steel end-use markets, albeit with normal year-end seasonal influences that typically impact fourth quarter performance. With our first nine months of 2018 net income of $1.7 billion, Nucor is poised to set a new annual earnings record, far eclipsing the 2008 record earnings of $1.8 billion. ","Thank you for your interest in our company. John?","John Ferriola","Thanks, Jim. I would like to conclude by saying a bit more about trade. As I mentioned earlier, the tariffs are having their intended impact by curbing unfairly traded imports. They are sending the message that the United States government is serious about achieving compliance with the rules of trade, but they are also having an important long-term impact. The tariffs are providing leverage to get other countries to the table to negotiate fairer trade agreements for the U.S.","We see both of the recently concluded trade agreements with South Korea and the new U.S., Mexico, Canada agreement as clear indications that the Trump administration's approach is working. We believe this new agreement with Mexico and Canada is good for the United States steelmakers and U.S. manufacturing as a whole and has important provisions that can be a model for future trade agreements with other countries.","Our government has a unique opportunity at this moment to improve our trading relationships. We hope the administration continues to make the most of it, particularly in its ongoing negotiations with China. ","We would now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Matthew Korn of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Korn","A question on the DRI plant. If you could help us understand a little bit, what in the original plan was not working to the extent that you needed, that now you're going to be putting in this new equipment and with this capital? And then what caused the unplanned outage over this quarter? And whatever it was, is that related to the weakness in the system that these equipment upgrades are aimed at fixing?","John Ferriola","Okay, Matthew. Good question. I'm glad you pointed that out. When you look at the money that we're going to be investing, it's about $200 million. And it could be split up just about equally between material handling and our processed gas heater. The -- let's start with the material handling. Basically, we had a failure in the domes that's been well reported. We've discussed it often. And it's taken some time for us to go back and reengineer the material handling without the domes to be more efficient. In fact, what we're going to be doing is modeling it very much after our Trinidad operation, which has been working extremely well for us. So about $90 million of the $200 million will be spent in the area of material handling. About another $85 million will be spent on the processed gas heaters, and as we've talked about many times, that's a separate piece of equipment. I often refer to it as a heating unit, an oven, that's been separate from us. We bought it off the shelf from an outside company. And just frankly, it was not a well-engineered product that we bought.","We've had many problems with an engineered well because of the way the tubes land through the oven, through the heating unit. So we're taking the time next year. It will cost about $85 million to do this, to go in there and we've passed some refractory that's been damaged as a result of the failures in the past and to reengineer, redesign the tubes in a way that we believe will be more reliable going into the future, more similar to what we use in heating units, processed gas heaters in other parts of the chemical industry. Basically, I would say 90% of the failures that we've had over the years result of either material handling failure with the domes or in the processed gas heaters. Now you asked specifically about the failure that we had in the last quarter. That was an unusual failure. It was, frankly, a human error. One of our teammates just made a mistake while he was doing a preventive maintenance function. One of those things where we're going in and hooking up, replacing an electronic component as part of our preventive maintenance programs. And during the process, a mistake was made that caused the trip that shut down the unit. And in DRI operations, whenever you shut it down, it's just a long time to put it back up no matter how simple the repair is. In this particular case, because you have to cool it down and then reheat it in a very, very specific way to avoid doing more damage to the unit. Does that answer your question, Matthew?","Matthew Korn","Yes, that does. That's actually great detail.","John Ferriola","Let me add one more point, Matthew, if I may, and that is this. As we look forward, we think that the changes that we're making will greatly improve the reliability of this unit. So we feel very confident about what we're doing. One of the highlights, the things that we feel positive about is we had concerns early on with when we had many failures that there was something in the technology itself that was not good, that was not going to work well, that was not going to be reliable. And as we've delved into this and we've focused, as we've talked about in the past, people, process and equipment, we've discovered that the technology itself, internal to the furnace, is better than we had anticipated at the beginning. So we feel positive about that.","Matthew Korn","John, that's very helpful. Let me then follow up on this, slightly different. You mentioned in your remarks that you've been very pleased so far with the execution of the 232 tariffs and with the government's approach overall on trade. Now the government has started to open up a bit the process by which some manufacturers can request exclusions to the 232 tariffs. We answered the quotas placed on certain countries. And there are some reports coming through, I think, even today on anticipation that we'll see some adjustments made on Canada and Mexico and how the tariffs will apply there. Is there any concern that you have that this could be weakening or be poised to weaken the 232 effect that you've been benefiting from so far this year?","John Ferriola","Well, as I've mentioned many times in the past, we consider 232 a tailwind to our performance this year. What we really believe has been driving our performance this year, it was more tax reform, regulatory reform. The trade cases that we have successfully prosecuted over the last 2 to 3 years was, of course, will not be affected by any changes in 232 and the investments that we've made in our company, growing the horsepower of our company. So as we see changes coming down the pike, we don't believe that they will have a major impact on our business now, more specifically to what we think might be happening, particularly within NAFTA. You've heard me say many times that we were ahead of NAFTA. And to have this will be good for the U.S. economy, it's been good for the U.S. steel industry. We did believe that there was some improvements needed to be made to our 20-something, 23-year-old agreement, and those adjustments were made. At the end of the day, we think that there could very well be some changes to tariffs versus quotas, not only within NAFTA, but to other countries.","But what we believe is that the tariffs are achieving their primary objective, which has been to bring other countries, including NAFTA countries with external to NAFTA also, bringing countries to the negotiating table to re-examine the way that we do trade and result in a more balanced trade policies and a more level playing field on which we compete. From day one, we have said the objective that we are hoping to achieve with 232 was to result long term in a more level playing field on which we can compete because we believe Nucor will do very well when we compete on a level playing field. And we think we see that happening. Now how it exactly shifts around going forward to get to that endpoint with tariffs or with quotas, I'm not in a position to say. But what I can tell you is that we continue to work with the administration to make sure that at the end of the day, we end up with an administration that supports free but fair trade as we go forward. We think, long term, if we establish trade relationships that are built upon a level playing field, you have a much longer-term positive effect than any short-term quotas or tariffs.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Seth Rosenfeld from Jefferies.","Seth Rosenfeld","I just have a couple of questions on the outlook for kind of near-term steel demand and its implication for pricing in the U.S., given the recent volatility you've seen in the flat market. One of your peers earlier have noted, they've seen essentially a hiatus in demand for flat products during Q3 but that their order intake has meaningfully increased in recent weeks. Just provide us a bit of color on what you've recently seen for buyer appetite, and perhaps, what they can tell us about the reception to your most recent price hike for flat steels. Let's start there, please.","John Ferriola","Well, what we saw in the end of the third quarter was pretty historical to what we see year-after-year. We always see some time around that period of dip, an order entry bias take a little bit of a timeout to kind of see what's going on. So we assess their inventory levels at the end of the year. And as we have seen in past years, it tends to be short term with order entry picking back up very quickly, and that's what we've seen this year also. So we also saw a dip in our order entry rate. We also have seen now a pickup, a resurgence in order entry rate on our flat products, both in sheet hot and cold band galvanized. Frankly, in our plate business, we were pretty solid all quarter. We did not see a historical dip that tends to occur. So I guess, at the end of the day, what I would say is that we still see strong demand. There is strength in the marketplace. We see pricing. It has come down a little bit. Our price increase that we've put in, I guess, it was about a week ago, was followed and seems to be sticking. So we feel good about that. So we -- and as I mentioned in the script, when we go out and look at our end markets, so the 24 end markets that we serve, 23 of them are either stable or on the uptick. And many of those that are on the uptick are just at the very beginning of the up cycle, which gives us confidence going into 2019 that we'll see the continued strength in both sheet and plate products.","Seth Rosenfeld","Just to follow-up, given that you brought up plate as well. Can you just give us a bit more color on how you view the supply-demand dynamics in that product? Plate certainly seems to have stood out positively versus other flat products in recent months. Does it have to do with import penetration, domestic demand or just the behavior of your local peers in the U.S.?","John Ferriola","I would say more of the first two than the third. Demand has been strong. Those markets that we sell into have been very strong. And energy, well, I can't say enough about energy. I was talking about earlier with the first question, the things that are driving our business, I negated to mention energy being so strong. That's what drives our business in sheet products, obviously, in oil country tubular goods. But it also has a major impact on our plate business. So with energy being so strong, we see demand in plate being very, very strong, and frankly, imports are down. So the imports are down significantly in plate. That's probably supporting the strength in our business. You've mentioned -- you touched a little bit upon our competitors. Some of our competitors have had outages during the third quarter, and that, of course, also helps the supply-demand equation. So yes, it's been strong. We see continued strength there. We see energy being strong going into 2019. And therefore, we see our plate business as well as the component of sheet that goes into energy being strong into 2019.","Operator","And our next question comes from Timna Tanners from Bank of America.","Timna Tanners","So I wanted to talk a little bit more about your very high-quality problem of what to do with all this cash that you're generating. I know you've attribute -- you've alluded to it quite a bit. You announced a $2 billion buyback. But if we just look at your free cash flow generation, you could use all that authorization up within a year without much problem if you use a lot of it in one year. I just wanted to get a little bit more flavor of how you're thinking about the world right now with -- vis-\u00e0-vis M&A, buybacks, and of course, you do have your own organic growth projects. Listening to you talk about DRI and of course, natural gas, you couldn't have anticipated, but certainly, there has been some pitfalls with some big investments in the past. I'm wondering, like, how are you thinking right now vis-\u00e0-vis buying other assets, further organic growth and deploying this buyback program.","John Ferriola","Well, I'm going to kick it off and talk a little bit about the first points of the cash that we are generating, and I'll turn it over to Jim and then ask him to turn it back to me and I'll address the last part of your question about how we're viewing organic growth and acquisitions in this part of the business cycle. But listen, you've heard us say this many times. Our first priority with our cash is to invest it in profitable, long-term growth, and that will be continued. That will continue to be our first and primary objective. Beyond that, if we don't have those opportunities, either through mergers or acquisitions or organic growth to invest profitably, then we will return it to our shareholders. Jim, do you want to kind of add some color to that?","James Frias","Yes. I would just say, Timna, John talked about the significant number of capital projects that are organic in our pipeline. And typically, organic investment projects have the most predictable and reliable returns as a side comment. But next year's CapEx will be dramatically higher than this year's. So when we look at our cash position and our forecast of free cash flow, it's not just based on what it is today, but what it's going to be over the next 12 to 18 months. We would expect a continued return, 40% of our earnings to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. And we meet with the board quarterly and show them what our total liquidity profile is, both in the short term and in the -- as well as what our outlook is for those things. And we have a good debate and discussion about whether it's appropriate to do something additionally for shareholders beyond just the 40%, and that process will continue. John?","John Ferriola","I'd like to address your last comment or question about organic growth and what else we might be doing with our cash, in addition to returning some of it to shareholders, as Jim has mentioned. And as you know, it would not be appropriate, and I will not make any specific comment to any specific acquisition opportunities. But I'd like to make just some general comments. And we said this consistently before that we are always on the lookout for opportunities to strategically grow our business. We look for opportunities that fit well with our five drivers of profitable growth. And we look to be opportunistic when it comes to valuing and acquiring those assets. And when we look at investing in long-term, profitable growth, you've got to consider different times of the business cycle, which present different opportunities. And we weigh those opportunities to invest capital in our existing facilities, as what we've announced at Gallatin, against opportunities to add new greenfield operations, such as our micro mills that we've announced, and against opportunities to acquire existing businesses from others.","And this should come as no surprise, but in strong markets, sellers are proud of their assets and they value them accordingly. That's why when you look at our history, we historically grow organically during the stronger markets. Now that said, we are always on the lookout for opportunistic buys, and we will continue to do that. In the end, Timna, the way I would like to say it is this, we deploy capital at whatever point we are in the business cycle in a way that creates the greatest long-term value to our shareholders. And that was a very vague and kind of long answer to the question, but we've been getting that question a lot lately, so I wanted to take the time to kind of talk about that in relation to your question about what do we do with our cash.","Timna Tanners","Okay. I appreciate it. It's a little bit of all the above. And I think that with the amount that you're generating, you have a lot of options. And I like your point about, in strong markets, organically, you have grown more in the past than the acquisitions. Well, that's interesting. Can I -- this is my second question. If I could drill down a little bit more and try to understand how to think about the raw materials segment. And I know that you just spent -- telling us about some of the projects that need to be completed at DRI, Louisiana. But it's been years of different projects, and I'm just struggling to think about, in the longer term, when do we consider that you get to the -- when will these projects finally get us to a good run rate? And how do we think about that run rate? Was the first half of the year EBIT a good run rate until the recent hiccups at your current capabilities? Is there upside to recent numbers? And when do we expect we get to that more normal operating environment?","John Ferriola","That's a good question, Timna. I'm glad you asked it. When I was talking about the DRI, I should have done -- gone a little further into the projects, the restructuring of the raw material side and of the processed gas heater to point out the timing of this event. It will take most of this year of -- -- excuse me, 2019, to get it ready with the engineering and the equipment. We're working on it now. Engineering is done. The equipment is being built. We will be taking a 60-day downturn. Sometime towards the end of the third quarter or the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2019, we will complete the work upon the material handling side. We will complete the work in the processed gas heater. Our objective, our intention is to come up after that. We think we'll be much more reliable. Our target is to achieve 8,000 hours, which would rival our performance in our Trinidad operation. I'd like to say that when you look at the quality of the product coming out of Louisiana, it rivals the quality of the product coming out of Trinidad. So we're there in terms of product quality. We need to get there in terms of reliability. We believe that these two projects will get us there. ","We've actually named this endeavor project 8,000 to keep people's minds focused on the fact that we need to get to 8,000 consistently, an 8,000-hour consistent run rate. And I want to take this moment to just give a shout-out. It's not exactly to your question. But I've got to give a shout-out to our team in Trinidad. They operated 137 days in a row, which is a record, okay, for a Midrex operation. And frankly, the only thing that stopped them from going further, Timna, was an earthquake, okay? An earthquake stops them, shuts them down, and then they turned right around. And the recovery they made after that earthquake was just nothing short of amazing and got back up and operating much quicker than I anticipated. And just well done, team in Trinidad, and thank you for doing such a great job and doing it safely. Jim, did you want to add something?","James Frias","No, you did it well, John. Thank you.","Timna Tanners","End of 2020, is that what you're thinking?","John Ferriola","No. At the end of -- yes, 2020. At the end of 2019, we will come back online with what we believe will be a very reliable DRI operations in Louisiana.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alex Hacking of Citi.","Alexander Hacking","I just wanted to follow up on Louisiana DRI again. You mentioned that some of the equipment is going to be modeled on Trinidad. If I remember correctly, Trinidad was built on Midrex technology, and I don't know if Louisiana was built on Midrex technology. I don't think so. Are you involved now with Midrex at Louisiana? Are they part of the solution there?","John Ferriola","Alex, let me clarify a point you might have misheard or I misspoke. When I was referring to that, what we're modeling after our Trinidad operation is simply the material handling end, okay? We had originally had domes to store and had a conveyor system to move our material handling in Louisiana. When the domes collapsed, we went to a more manual system, and that's what we have been using for the last couple of years while we've been in the process of deciding, which is the best method to use to handle material. That is not a Midrex design. It's not an HYL design. That's a Nucor design that we've used in Trinidad for, I don't know, 10, 15 years or something like that. So at the end of all of the studying, we've decided that the way that we've handled the material in Trinidad has been very effective, and we've decided to model Louisiana's material handling after Trinidad's material handling, nothing to do with Midrex or HYL technology.","Alexander Hacking","Okay. And then the second question, how concerned are you about -- like a macro question. How concerned are you about the amount of flat-rolled capacity that's coming into the U.S. market over the next 3 to 4 years? It's one of the biggest questions that we get from investors. Between your plants, your competitor's plants and a couple of restarts, there's a lot of capacity alive and people are concerned that there might not be sufficient demand. Maybe you could comment.","John Ferriola","Well, it's interesting that you say you get that question a lot from investors. So do we. We keep hearing that in terms of what other people are doing and also, frankly, in terms of what we are doing. So let me start by talking a little bit about what some of the things that we are doing. I'd be very specific in saying, look, we're not adding capacity. We said this in the script. We don't add capacity simply to add capacity. And we're investing in our company to better serve our customers, to strengthen our competitive position and frankly, to reinvest and position our divisions for the next decade. So all of our expansion plans are being made with very, very specific, strategic objectives. So let me start with that point. Now I'm going to spend a little bit of time on this because we do get it so often. We hear from many of our investors. So let me just talk a little bit about some of the things that we're doing, why we're doing them and what we're looking to accomplish. I hear a lot about our long products plans in rebar and merchant, and this, are we concerned about that we're adding 700,000 tons of rebar to the market and 400,000 tons of perch into the market.","When you look at that, you'd say, \"Well, we're adding 1.1 million tons of long products into the market.\" But the reality is that we're realigning our position in long products and reassigning some divisions into new products, into new areas. So when you look at how we're shifting things around, okay, we are moving 400 tons of the rebar, of our current rebar, into long and SBQ, into new divisions, into new products and new divisions. At the end of the day, when you look at how we've restructured our long products in rebar and merchant bar, what we're actually adding is about 500,000 tons, okay, and actually shifting about 70% of the added milled capacity will be directed into new or higher value-added products, specifically long and SBQ. So when you look at what our long products' strategy is, we're not just simply adding into the -- additional tons into the market. We're realigning our production to better meet our customer demand in the markets. And I can't give you a better example of that than Sedalia. So let me just talk about Sedalia for a minute, okay? Sedalia is located in the middle of 900,000 rebar market, 900,000 tons. Of that 900,000 tons, 700,000 of that 900,000 tons in that market, Sedalia will have between a 350-mile and 400-mile freight advantage in shipping to their customers. That is not insignificant when you look at costs. And when you add to that fact that we are surrounding Sedalia with David J. Joseph's scrap operations that are literally within 50 miles...","James Frias","75, 80 miles.","John Ferriola","75, 80 miles of that operation, and I think we have about 10 -- 8 to 10 processing plants within...","James Frias","11.","John Ferriola","11 to be exact, okay, within 70 or 80 miles, look at the advantage that we could have from a cost perspective. And I bring this up because when we talk about overcapacity, the way to survive in an overcapacity market, if there is one, is to be the low-cost producer. So the investments that we're making on the long products side will lower our costs, bring us closer to the customers, okay, and that's a very strategic objective that we have on long products. So again, I'm going to be just very brief. I'll be quick, okay? All right. I've got my CFO, who's shaking his head at the length of my answer. But this overcapacity issue comes up over and over again. So I want to make sure that people understand. When we talk about we're adding capacity at Gallatin in hot band, it's a very specific type of hot band that we're adding, okay? It's wire, all right? It's -- we're starting out with a thicker tested slab going into it. And why is that important? Well, that gives us different physical properties. ","And very specifically, it allows us to move into the, what we call, the X grades, okay, which gets us into the pipe market. So the investment that we're making in Gallatin gets us into a new market, okay? The galvanizing line that we're putting in at Gallatin, it's going to be the widest hot-band galvanizing line in North America. That opens up a world of new markets for us. So I'm not going to go through every one of them or I think my CFO will hit me over the head, okay? But if you look at every specific organic growth investment that we are making in this company, it is being done with a very specific, strategic objective, either lowering the cost, moving us up the value chain or getting us into new markets. And that's a very important difference to the investments that we're making and some of the other ones that I hear around the country. Now I would just back all of that up with, when you look at -- and we've had -- I mean, we do market studies all the time. And when we look particularly at sheet, we think that there is a consistent growth of about 2% in hot band, cold rolled and galvanized over the next 4 to 5 years. So when you look at the overcapacity or the new capacity that you referred to as overcapacity, there's room for it to grow. You add into that the work that's being done and we will continue to do in lowering the imports. Right now, if you look at last year, imports accounted for 27% of the market. We've got that down now to 24%. Historically, import should be somewhere in the neighborhood of 15% to 20%. And I also don't know if I have the numbers exactly right, but when you lower that import from 27%, 28% down to somewhere in the neighborhood of 15%, you're basically eliminating 12 million to 13 million tons. That gives you that amount of room to grow with a product that's produced domestically. So between the normal year-over-year growth, the reduction in imports, there's room to grow our domestic supply. In addition to that, when you look at our projects, they're very targeted to very specific, strategic objectives. Long answer, I apologize, but I wanted to address this overcapacity issue because I think it's being pulled along.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Philip Gibbs","I have a question on DRI just from a slightly different angle. So this $200 million that you're spending relative to today, what type of return are you expecting to get with that capital? And then sub-question, what would it take for you to consider a second module in Louisiana?","John Ferriola","Jim, do you want to take a shot?","James Frias","Well, Phil, the return metrics are really about getting the plant to be stable and predictable and operated at 8,000-ton rate. So if we compare operating it at an 8,000-ton rate to where they've been the last 2 or 3 years, the return is tremendous. It's extremely high.","John Ferriola","And can I add to that, Jim?","James Frias","8000 hours, sorry. Thank you. My mistake, I misspoke.","John Ferriola","And Jim makes a very good point. In addition to that, as we have more reliability in our DRI, it allows us to more strategically approach how we buy obsolete and prime scrap both, okay? So the value -- everyone tends to look at, well, what's the return on the DRI plant itself. And that's -- there's going to be a good return. But more -- I believe, more importantly, it's the value that it's bringing to the rest of the, I don't know, 18 million tons of scrap that we buy, somewhere in the neighborhood with this year, 18 million tons.","James Frias","So it's actually a bit more than that. It's probably -- total metallics are probably closer to 20 million.","John Ferriola","More. And when you look at the pig iron, okay, that we buy, that's another 3 million, 4 million tons, it allows us to strategically place our buys with a greater deal of reliability. And that's where you get the real value out of a more reliable DRI plant in Louisiana.","James Frias","Yes, about our Phase 2, John.","John Ferriola","On Phase 2? Well, we've continued to look at that. We have the infrastructure in Louisiana. At this time, we have no plans to put a second unit in. But as you heard me say in the past, I personally believe that there is going to be more of a need for alternative iron units as we continue to move up the value chain and also as the existing prime scrap continues to degrade, as it continuously recycle through the process. As I've mentioned many times before, you cannot get copper out. And the amount of copper that has grown in prime scrap is, it's up like 300% since we've began tracking it in 1990 -- somewhere in the 1990s. So between the fact that it's degrading, between -- you add the fact that manufacturing is leaving the United States, this is where we get most of our prime scrap and that with the computerization of nesting, you get less scrap even in the manufactured products within the United States. For all of those reasons, I think prime scrap is going to continue to be challenged, and pricing will continue to increase and the value of DRI will increase also.","Philip Gibbs","And Jim, would it be crazy to think that the spend could be a 2 to 3 year payback, given that dramatically increased uptime potential?","James Frias","Yes. I think it's probably closer to two years. They've routinely -- at least they say it's the figure on pricing market. When that plant runs well, that had real strong contributions per month, which makes me feel like that could be a two year payback versus when they have problems.","Philip Gibbs","That's perfect. And I just have another -- I have kind of a somewhat of a modeling question and then a strategic question. On the modeling, should we expect any further cost pressures on refractories or electrodes moving forward? Or has the bulk of that been felt or at least the majority of that have been felt already?","John Ferriola","I think the majority of this have been felt already, particularly when we talk about electrodes. In fact, I think as -- maybe not so much in 2019 but beyond 2019, as the needle coke situation has been resolved, production starts to come back up, I think you'll see a gradual weakening in the pricing of electrodes, refractories. We've seen some increase in pricing, but that's been relatively stable over the last 4, 5 months.","Philip Gibbs","And then my -- the last question, John, is just on the strength of the cycle. Right now, I think you said 23 or 24 markets flat or increasing. What's the one right now that's been lagging out of that bucket?","John Ferriola","Marine transportation products. For us specifically, barges. We do sell some of our plate and some structural into barge market, and that has been weak. Marine transportation is the one general market that we feel is weak.","Operator","And our next question comes from Derek Hernandez of Seaport Global Securities.","Derek Hernandez","I just wanted to ask on your forward view into the end of the year in 2019 on scrap pricing for prime and obsolete.","John Ferriola","You mean 2018?","Derek Hernandez","Well, through the end of 2018 and possibly how it may evolve.","John Ferriola","And into '19, okay. Okay.","Derek Hernandez","Yes.","John Ferriola","I would say that as we -- as is typical, towards the end of the year, you see moderate increasing in scrap pricing as seasonal issues come up. And depending on the weather, it will determine just how severe it is. So I would say we'd see a general increase in scrap pricing over the next several months through the first part of 2019. And then typically, as we see in this plan, it begins to moderate. I don't see anything radical. Barring any unusual events in the world, I don't see a major change, maybe in the neighborhood of $20, $25 on the upside over the next several months.","Derek Hernandez","And if I could follow up quickly on your customers' inventories. Now that you've spoken about people coming back to market following the pricing increase last week, is there any additional detail you could give there?","John Ferriola","When we look at -- the way I typically answer that is to refer to the months on hand with our service-side customers. And when you look at months on hand in virtually every one of our products, they are low. Not critically low, but they are lower than -- they are low. And then frankly, over the last 4 to 5 months, they have been decreasing, which is not unusual. So we feel pretty good about where the -- where our customers' inventories are at this point. We don't see a year-end oversupply in their inventories that are going to cause any problems on order entry.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Curt Woodworth from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Curtis Woodworth","Yes. So I'm wondering if you could just expand a little bit more on some of the CapEx moving pieces next year. You had a comment that you think CapEx will be dramatically higher. So could you just frame some of the buckets? And would you think the bulk of the DRI spend is completed next year? In order of magnitude, are we thinking up 40% to 50% year-on-year? Just help us frame the moving parts.","James Frias","We're not. We don't have a breakdown CapEx in terms of by project. We've told you what the overall -- each project individually is going to be when we announce them. But I would just say that next year's CapEx is probably going to be more than 40% higher than this year's.","John Ferriola","We've got a lot of projects coming on. We're entering into the pace of the project where a lot of costs are incurred with equipment purchasing and so forth.","Operator","And with no further questions, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. John Ferriola for any additional or closing remarks.","John Ferriola","Okay. Thank you. And to our customers, I'd like to say that we appreciate the trust that you place in Nucor, and we will continue to earn it with every order. To our shareholders, thank you for your continued confidence and support. And to my 25,000 teammates, I'd like to thank you for another solid quarter. The team in Charlotte appreciates the hard work you do every day to build a safer and more profitable Nucor. Thank you all for your interest in Nucor. Have a great day.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference.

Please go ahead, sir.","John J. Ferriola","Thank you. Good afternoon. This is John Ferriola, Nucor's Chief Executive Officer and President. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor.","With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior leadership team: Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; and our other Executive Vice Presidents: Jim Darsey, Keith Grass, Ladd Hall, Ham Lott and Joe Stratman.","First, and most importantly, we want to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for your hard work, taking care of all of our customers in today's very challenging market conditions. As always, you are doing it by working safely, working smart and working together. You are Nucor's greatest asset and our real competitive advantage with the right people doing the right things every day. Thank you all.","Last week, Ham Lott announced his plans to retire in early June, and Ray Napolitan has been named as his successor as Executive Vice President, leading the Fabricated Construction Products team. Ham's retirement and Ray's promotion are part of the thoughtful and orderly succession planning process that has been an important strategic initiative throughout Nucor in recent years.","Ham began his career in 1975 and has served since 1999 as Executive Vice President responsible for Fabricated Construction Products. Over his 37 years of service with our company, Ham has dedicated himself to Nucor's continual improvement and strengthening our competitive position.","Under his leadership, Nucor's downstream businesses have nearly tripled to their current annual capacity of more than 4.6 million tons.","On behalf of myself, Dan Dimicco and the entire Nucor family, I want to thank Ham for his many contributions to making Nucor a better company. Ham, thank you for a job extremely well done. And remember, while you may be retiring, you will always be a member of the Nucor family.","Ray Napolitan is a 17-year veteran of our company. He is a highly effective Nucor leader with experience in our metal buildings, joist and deck operations. Since 2010, he has served as President of Nucor's Vulcraft\/Verco group. Ray and his team are well prepared to build upon our record of long-term profitable growth in downstream and fabricated products.","In addition to providing Nucor attractive long-term returns, these businesses enhance the profitability and growth opportunities of our core steelmaking business.","I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to discuss our first quarter results and financial position. Following Jim, I will update you on Nucor's growth strategy. Jim?","James D. Frias","Thanks, John, and good afternoon. First quarter 2013 earnings of $0.26 per diluted share were modestly above our guidance range of between $0.20 to $0.25 per diluted share. The decline from fourth quarter 2012 earnings of $0.43 per diluted share was due to the swing from a fourth quarter LIFO credit of $0.14 per diluted share to the first quarter's LIFO charge of $0.03 per diluted share.","The decline from year-ago first quarter earnings of $0.46 per diluted share was largely the result of weaker operating results from our steel mills as the typical seasonal improvement in the first quarter did not occur.","A quick comment about our tax rate since it can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting out profits belonging to our business partners, the first quarter of 2013 effective tax rate was 33.4%.","Balance sheet strength remains an important attribute of Nucor's business model. Our total debt-to-capital ratio was 32%. Cash, short-term investments and restricted cash totaled $1.1 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2013.","Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn, and it does not mature until December 2016.","We have no commercial paper outstanding.","Nucor is the only steel producer in North America to enjoy the extremely important competitive advantage of an investment-grade credit rating. The benefits of our credit rating include a lower cost of capital, financial flexibility and Nucor's position as the lowest risk counterparty for both customers and suppliers. Our natural gas working interest investments to support Nucor's raw material strategy are an excellent example of how financial strength pays off for Nucor.","Our strong liquidity and cash flow through the ongoing Great Recession is allowing us to continue Nucor's long tradition of growing stronger during downturns.","2013 capital expenditures are expected to exceed $1.1 billion. Of this total, we estimate that approximately $300 million is for maintenance capital projects and $800 million is for projects to grow Nucor's long-term earnings power.","We are implementing a number of projects throughout our upstream steelmaking and downstream businesses to develop new products, increase quality and reduce costs.","The most significant of these initiatives are: our Louisiana direct reduced iron facility and the related natural gas drilling investments; expanding SBQ production capabilities at our bar mills in South Carolina, Nebraska and Tennessee; expanding our Nucor-Yamato structural mills portfolio of sheet piling products; expanding our South Carolina flat-rolled mills portfolio to include wider and lighter gauge hot-rolled sheet; adding a normalizing line at our North Carolina plate mill; and constructing a new reheat furnace at our Connecticut bar mill.","In his comments, John Ferriola will update you on some of the more significant projects that will be starting up in coming months.","Our team is excited by the opportunities we are executing on to award Nucor shareholders with very attractive long-term returns on their valuable capitals. The objective of our growth strategy is higher highs and peak earnings power and shareholder value through successive business cycles.","For the second quarter of 2013, Nucor's earnings are expected to improve from first quarter levels. This reflects our outlook for improved performance at our downstream businesses, raw material operations and most steel mill product groups. The exception to the anticipated overall trend of improvement is the flat-rolled market. Excess supply, both domestically and from imports, remains a very serious challenge for the sheet steel industry.","We are growing more concerned about slowing in the economic recovery. Recently published service center shipment data for the first quarter of 2013 shows a year-over-year reduction in shipments of over 6%, with reductions in every category of carbon steel products.","However, this comparison may somewhat overstate the magnitude of market softness. In 2012, the first quarter was the strongest quarter of the year for service center shipments as seasonal upward pricing momentum encouraged buyers to accelerate purchases.","It is also worth noting that the first quarter of 2013 shipments increased over 14% from the fourth quarter of 2012 level.","We continue to be cautiously optimistic about nonresidential construction markets in 2013 as they slowly improve from very depressed levels. The most recent McGraw-Hill Construction market survey projects nonresidential construction square footage growth of about 8% for 2013 compared to 2012. This level remains less than half of the 2007 peak. Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance in the final month of the quarter. John?","John J. Ferriola","Thanks, Jim. The magnitude and duration of this ongoing Great Recession is unlike anything we've experienced in our lifetime. We are now 5 years into what remains a depressed and stagnant global economic environment.","Here is a statistic that tells the real story. In the United States today, approximately 30 million people are either unemployed, underemployed or have simply given up hope for finding a job and have dropped out of the labor force. On a percentage basis, the true unemployment rate today rivals levels last experienced during the Great Depression of the 1930s.","Against this backdrop, steel market fundamentals remain very challenging. Utilization rates for the American steel industry remain mired in the 70% range.","At the same time, imports have surged over the past several years to levels totally inconsistent with the stagnant domestic economy. These import levels make no sense whatsoever when you consider the fact that American producers are among the lowest cost producers of steel in the world.","But the Nucor team always thinks and acts with a long-term perspective. We are able to do this because of the strength of Nucor's business model. These strengths include our strong balance sheet, our healthy cash flow generation through the cycle, a low and highly variable cost structure, great product diversification, our market leadership positions, a flexible production capacity and most importantly, our culture.","Longer term, we are bullish on the profitable growth opportunities for both the American economy and to Nucor. Our team is bullish on the American people and their ability to do the right things over the long run to reinvigorate our economy.","Speaking frankly, the time is right for a U.S. economic renaissance, fueled by our country's abundant energy resources and an unrivaled workforce. That is why we are busy building a stronger Nucor with significantly greater long-term earnings power.","Challenging economic times provide excellent opportunities to grow profitably for companies like Nucor. To be more specific, the Nucor team is expanding and diversifying our product lines into more value-added and higher-margin offerings to better serve our customers. The Nucor team remains relentless in its focus on continual improvement in safety, quality and cost.","The Nucor team is aggressively implementing our raw material strategy, and the Nucor team is speaking out to sound economic policies that create what our economy needs the most: jobs, jobs and more jobs.  One of the most important of these policies, being a global environment of rules-based, rules-enforced free trade.","Since the last cyclical peak in 2008, through disciplined execution of our multipronged growth strategy, we have invested nearly $7 billion of our shareholders' valuable capital at year-end 2012.","With our expected 2013 capital spending of more than $1 billion, our cumulative investments since the last cyclical peak will total approximately $8 billion. These investments have dramatically increased Nucor's long-term earnings power.","During the next several years, our focus will remain on executing our strategic plan and converting those $8 billion of investments into profits once the inevitable cyclical upturn arrives.","Our teams continue to push -- continued to push through our growth initiatives during the first quarter. Two very significant projects are scheduled for completion later in 2013. Coal commission has begun at our 2.5 million ton annual capacity, direct reduced iron, or DRI, facility in Louisiana. Due to record rainfall levels and other severe weather conditions in the quarter, we expect to start production late in the third quarter of this year.","In January and February, our construction site received a total of more than 30 inches of rain, followed by more heavy rains in March.","In addition to this record precipitation, our progress was slowed by extremely strong winds on a number of days in the first 3 months of this year.","After construction is completed, we expect a very fast start-up of production for 2 reasons. Over the past 6 years, Nucor has achieved world-class operating performance at our DRI facility in Trinidad. Equally important is our extremely high confidence in the reliability and enhanced capabilities of the HYL technology we selected.","HYL is a proven technology. Today, about 25% of DRI production in the world utilizes the HYL technology. The completion and start-up of our Louisiana DRI facility and with our investments in a long-term and low-cost supply of natural gas is a major step forward in the full implementation of our raw materials strategy.","Simply put, we see this strategy as a game changer for Nucor's cost structure for high-quality iron units.","Our Hertford County, North Carolina plate mill will begin hot commissioning its normalizing line in June and begin production in the third quarter.","Complementing prior investments in a heat treating facility and a vacuum tank degasser, the normalizing line will allow us to further expand our participation in a number of value-added plate markets.","Finally, a recent achievement in one of our downstream products deserves special recognition. I want to congratulate and thank our teams in our metal building groups for attaining in 2012, for the first time ever, the market leader position in revenue and in shipments.","Nucor now enjoys an important competitive advantage of market leadership in 8 out of the 10 major products in which we compete: steel beams, merchant bars, rebar, steel joists, steel decking, steel piling distribution, rebar fabrication and distribution and now pre-engineered metal buildings.","In closing, I want to again thank everyone on the Nucor team for their hard work and sacrifice during these tough economic times. I can confidently assure you that our broad scope of work will pay big dividends to the entire Nucor family when the inevitable economic recovery arrives.","Thank you, and please keep it going. Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. We would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask you about these investments you're making in the growth projects. Is 2013 the peak you think or this will continue on in the next few years? Just to understand the CapEx for the next few years.","John J. Ferriola","Well, in terms of investments, a lot of the projects that we are currently working on will finish out in 2013 or early 2014. We never limit ourselves looking at the future. We're not sure when potential opportunities will come up so we always keep our options open. We have a strong balance sheet, so if we have the right opportunities, we can continue our investments. And that said, we will always be continuing our role in new products on an organic basis in our existing mills. We are always looking for new opportunities to grow our product range and to improve our products and move further up in the value-added markets.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Should we consider a second DRI unit, the second module which you had a little bit postponed sort of something which is going to start sometime in -- at least the construction sometime in '14?","John J. Ferriola","It's too early to comment on that. Our objective right now is to focus on getting the first module up and running and getting the DRI into our facilities. You do know that we have built the infrastructure and support structure at the existing Louisiana facility to support 2 units. So when we move forward with the second unit, the timeline will be a little bit shorter, the investments will be a little bit lower and we can move forward a little quicker. It's [ph] already in place for the second unit, so that's also a timesaver.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One last thing on nonres construction. Are you seeing improvement year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter as it is moving forward from, let's say, sometime middle of last year?","John J. Ferriola","As Jim mentioned in his comments, as we look forward into 2013, we see a slightly better nonresidential construction environment. We use the word cautiously optimistic. We see some signs of improvement. The ABI index has been over 50% for 7 months in a row now. When you look at residential construction, which is sometimes a leading indicator of nonresidential construction, housing starts up over a million units annualized, which is the first time since, I don't know, 2007, 2008, somewhere back then. So there are some encouraging signs that things are getting better in nonresidential construction. Now having said that, when we say that they get marginally better in 2013, that would take them to roughly 60% or 65% of the levels that they peaked out at during 2007.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First question, just on DRI. One thing that I'm curious about is just the value and use issues with using DRI in an electric arc furnace relative to pig iron. I was wondering if you can kind of give us a sense of how that slows down productivity. Does it increase tap-to-tap times? What does it actually do to your operating cost at the mill?","John J. Ferriola","There is a value and use penalty in using DRI. We estimate that to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $15 to $20 a ton. It really isn't a function of productivity. It does slow you down a little bit. It's more of a function of cost on other components, refractory costs and other operating costs similar to that. Now we have done a lot of work on DRI in electric arc furnaces. We've done a lot of testing at our existing furnaces. And to date, we've been able to add -- at our Hickman facility, we ran heats with 40% to 45% -- I'm sorry, that was actually what we did at Decatur. I said Hickman by mistake. But at Decatur, we ran trials using DRI so that we could get a good feel for what the penalties would be, both in productivity and in costs. So we feel we have a real good handle on those estimates.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's great. And then just something else on non-metal costs. And maybe this is too simple of an analysis, but just looking at the first quarter in 2013, metal margins were $377, roughly the same in first quarter 2012, $379. Volumes were a little lighter this year versus last by a few percent, but operating profit was down about 30% or so. So I was hoping you can just help us understand some of the moving pieces. I assume some of that's mixed, some of that is fixed cost absorption. But just to get a handle on how non-metal costs are tracking year-on-year.","James D. Frias","First of all, I think you're comparing the first quarter to the last quarter when you talk about volumes being flat because versus last year, they're down. And then you're looking at profits from last year. Am I mistaken or I misunderstand your question? I think...","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, volume down 3.5% year-on-year versus first quarter 2012 and the steel business were up 4.277, down this quarter versus 4.424 from first quarter 2012. And then I'm comparing metal margins from the same quarters as well, they're roughly flat.","James D. Frias","I didn't think metal margins were flat from last year's first quarter. I don't have that in my fingertips but I thought they were down.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Well, are there any kind of mix issues that we should be aware that could be impacting just margins in general going forward, aside from just the headline metal margin number that we should be thinking about?","John J. Ferriola","Mix is always an issue when you look at those numbers. I don't have the specifics in front of me, but I would say that our mix did change pretty significantly first quarter '13 relative to first quarter '12, if that helps answer your question.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Curt Woodworth with Nomura.","Curtis Rogers Woodworth - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I was wondering if you could spend a little bit of time on what you're seeing in some of the long product markets, specifically on the bar side. I mean, it seems like volumes are accelerating for you guys and bar up, I think, 7% year-on-year. But what we've been reading on metal margins, they've been pretty static. I think you guys actually lowered NBQ by about $50 a ton earlier this year, and we've seen the import pressure seemed to spike a little bit. So do you think it's a function of just the demand is kind of slowly moving along? Or do you think that the potential for imports is kind of the key issue holding back spreads in bar right now?","John J. Ferriola","Well, let me start by saying imports continue to be an anchor around the neck of the entire industry. Global overcapacity is a major issue, as is domestic overcapacity in all of the steel products, long Products and flat products. Now that said, we do see 2013 to be slightly better in terms of volumes and in pricing in all of our steel products with the exception of sheet. We think sheet will be -- will continue to be very challenged, particularly in the second quarter. We believe the volumes will be similar or maybe a little bit higher, but pricing will be very challenged on our sheet business.","Curtis Rogers Woodworth - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And just a quick question on DRI. Can you provide any kind of update on your views on metallization rate or reduction costs? I know that it's a relatively widely used technology but I think the process you guys are using, the DRI process, there's only 2 plants globally utilizing that technology right now, if that's correct. So any update there would be appreciated.","John J. Ferriola","Well, there's many more than 2 plants operating globally using the HYL technology. In terms of the metallization rates, clearly, we study both the Midrex and the HYL very carefully before moving forward. We're convinced in looking at some of the HYL facilities that our teams have visited and did a deep dive into -- that they will be able to achieve similar numbers to what we see in Trinidad, perhaps a little bit better. We're looking in the neighborhood of 96.5% to 97% on metallization rates and somewhere in the neighborhood of 3% to 3.5% of carbon levels. Actually, I think, if I'm not mistaken, Ladd, you might be able to help me out here. I believe there's just been 2 large HYL facilities, both of about 2.0 million tons capacity, that have started up in the last year or 1.5 years.","Ladd R. Hall","That's correct.","Curtis Rogers Woodworth - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","The plant in Egypt?","John J. Ferriola","Yes, there's one in Egypt. There's another one somewhere in the Middle East, Dubai, I think it is.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Yu with Citigroup.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","John, question on DRI first. Once these plants are up and running, can you just give us a sense as to how much of that capacity will be displacing pig iron versus, say, like prime [ph] scrap that you're buying now?","John J. Ferriola","Well, it'll displace pig iron and it will displace prime scrap. Now how the mix works out, is going to be a function of the cost of the materials at the time while we're making these decisions. We'll have several options in front of us. We can use brands cap, we can use pig iron that we'll continue to purchase and we can use the DRI out of our 2 facilities. One of the great advantages this is going to give us is the flexibility to make good economic decisions on iron units as we move forward.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then the second one I've got is on SBQ. It seems like from the data that you were looking at, SBQ shipments haven't quite recovered yet with you and another competitor bringing online more capacity. Like, how are you guys thinking about placing that into the marketplace?","John J. Ferriola","Well, certainly, there have been a lot of announcements on SBQ volume expansions among our competitors. How do we plan to deal with it? Well, we're going to compete fiercely and successfully with the additional SBQ that comes into the marketplace. We have great confidence in our teams, our equipment and in our products. We also believe that, given the continual growth in the automotive markets, that there will be an increased need for SBQ as we move forward. We have automotive. We have energy, which consumes a lot of SBQ, continuing to go strong -- grow strongly. Heavy trucks, although it's come down a little bit this year, we expect it to return in 2014 to higher levels. So although there's been a lot of SBQ that's been announced and will be coming into the market, we anticipate the demand for SBQ to grow also.","James D. Frias","Yes, one other thing is I've believe the capital projects we have for SBQ, there's a mix of them. The ones we're doing initially are geared more towards moving up the value-added chains. The ones that add capacity will be later in the sequence of capital projects in SBQ for us.","John J. Ferriola","And maybe just one more point, Jim. That's a good point. Thank you for adding that. Just one additional comment on this. In addition to adding SBQ, this is allowing us to realign our existing mills so that our merchant products are produced more efficiently also by reassigning products to different facilities. We're consolidating our merchant production at some of our facilities, so we're going to gain some efficiencies in that area also. It's important to note, as we always do point out, although we continue to grow into the value-added markets, we do that without surrendering any of the commodity or lower our value-level markets.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS Securities.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I figured I would continue the questions on DRI. One thing I was wondering, if you can sort of help me out there a little bit, the economics definitely make sense, love the optionality of choosing where you can go and how you substitute and so forth. In the past, we've sort of recognized and acknowledged natural gas as kind of the risk if it goes up and you've taken steps to mitigate that and so forth. How should we think about the spread between iron ore prices since it is a feedstock versus local scrap pricing, which you're effectively replacing? Or in some respect, is that something that we should be thinking about as a risk or an opportunity? How should we be thinking about that? Is Magnetation, as a feedstock, something that you might look at in the future?","John J. Ferriola","Well, when you look back historically in comparison between iron ore pricing and scrap, there's been a very strong correlation for a period of, as far back as I've looked at it, 20, 25 years. So we expect that to continue. We see a strong correlation between iron ore pricing and scrap pricing. Keith, is there anything you'd like to add to that?","Keith B. Grass","Well, one point, John. There is a correlation and it does continue, especially over a period of time, an extended period of time. The 2 come together as the metallics markets around the world sort of the arbitrage opportunities sort of minimize themselves.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. So you're not expecting any -- the potential for any disconnects or anything?","John J. Ferriola","We don't see that in the future. As I said, it's been -- as I look back in history for 20 to 25 years, we haven't seen that and, I guess, I'd never say never, but we don't anticipate seeing anything of that nature.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And a follow-up question, if I may. The commentary in your press release today sort of suggests a pickup in Q1 from an earnings perspective. I was just wondering if I can get a bit of expanded color around that. Metal margins aren't the greatest at this point right now. Is it just a function of some of the unplanned outages not occurring? Is it today's price announcement that one of the competitors announced? Or is it some volume opportunities unique to Nucor? Just wondering if you can sort of expand what's driving the optimism.","John J. Ferriola","First of all, I assume you meant improvement in Q2?","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, sorry, in Q2, yes.","John J. Ferriola","Okay, yes, okay. Well, as we said during the script and during Jim's comments, basically, in all of our products, with the exception of sheet, we see improvement in demand. Again, marginal improvement, slight improvement. I don't want to mislead anyone here. We see it getting better across all of our products with the exception of sheet in terms of volume and pricing to a less extent. Some of our products will see better pricing opportunities in 2013. Some will continue to struggle such as sheet. So across all of our products, we see some improvement with the exception, of course, of sheet, as I've mentioned several times.","Operator","We'll go next to David Galison with CIBC World Markets.","David Galison - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to touch on the DRI delay. Just wondering if there's any additional costs associated there with the delay. And when do you see it turning -- swinging to a profit now?","John J. Ferriola","Could you repeat that question? I heard the first part of it, but I missed the last thought. You were asking if there were any additional issues other than the ones that we mentioned?","David Galison - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","Any additional costs associated with the delay and when you see it turning to a profit?","John J. Ferriola","Oh, there might be some minimal additional costs. The contract is to stay -- have to stay on site longer. We lost the ability to work on those days when there was heavy rain. It's the case of Murphy laws -- Murphy's Law driving us back. During the period of December, January and February, they had record rainfall in St. James Parish. So we'll see a minor increase in the cost of construction, but nothing major at all. It'll just be a case of the inefficiencies for our contractors working during those rainy season -- during those rainy days. And you're asking about turning a profit?","James D. Frias","Yes, this is Jim Frias. The business unit is forecasting making money in the fourth quarter, and we expect free operating and start-up costs to go up by about $4 million in the third quarter related to ramping up employment at that facility.","David Galison - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","And then you're still looking for a 2- to 4-month ramp-up to full capacity?","John J. Ferriola","Yes, we will be at full capacity -- we anticipate being at full capacity by the end of the year.","David Galison - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just on the nonres construction. You've mentioned being cautiously optimistic. I'm just kind of wondering if you could talk about what you would be looking to see before maybe becoming a bit more positive on the overall markets?","John J. Ferriola","Well, we look at -- we have an advantage in a sense that we can look at some of our downstream businesses. We look at the order entry rates, the backlogs, the pricing opportunities in those downstream businesses, Harris company, rebar fabrication, Verco and Vulcraft operations. Now we've seen a little bit of improvement when we look year-over-year on our Vulcraft, Verco backlogs. We see some improvement on new orders and then our margins are up fairly significantly year-over-year in both joist and deck. So those are some of the things that we watch and we see as positive indicators. What would get us to the point where we were more optimistic would be when we saw greater order entry rate, higher prices, a larger backlog. Now there are -- we do have some anecdotal information from time to time that seems to indicate things are getting better. We just recently attended an AISC conference and I had an opportunity to interact with a lot of our customers there in the nonresidential construction area, and they were more positive than we've seen them in a long time. So again, these are all small indicators and that's why we've put the \"cautiously optimistic\" in the sentence. But as we see more and more of these indicators, we can gain confidence and we'll be happy to be able to share that with you when it occurs.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Richard Garchitorena with Credit Suisse.","Richard Garchitorena - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So just a couple of questions. One, you have mentioned a few times about the weakness in the sheet market. Can you just expand? Is that really a function of oversupply in the import situation? Or is it demand sort of flattening out here?","John J. Ferriola","Clearly, you have to look at demand when you say you have an oversupply situation. But the amount of overcapacity globally and domestically in the sheet market is phenomenal right now. It's clearly an oversupplied market, clearly, an oversupplied market, and that problem is amplified by the heavy level of imports, the surge of imports that have come in over the last, well, really, over the last year, 1.5 years. So yes, it's an issue of oversupply. Demand certainly is not stellar, but demand has been improving quarter-over-quarter by a small amount. We've mentioned a few times automotive. We've mentioned energy in the form of pipe and tube. So demand is there and demand is growing slowly. Unfortunately, more and more capacity is being brought online and imports continue to come into the country at very, very high levels. So as long as that situation exists, it's going to be a very, very challenging sheet market.","Richard Garchitorena - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then is it right to assume that on the Long Products side, you are seeing better improvement, especially recently given sort of some of the signs that you've seen on the construction side?","John J. Ferriola","Again, on Long Products, we are seeing some slight improvement and we anticipate that to continue as the year plays out, as 2013 plays out. But again, we're talking about a slight improvement. We haven't seen anything to get very excited about at this point. All the things that we talked about during the call so far; increasing, small increase in the amount of nonresidential construction is helping, introducing new products and moving up the value chain by increasing the breadth of our product offering. For Nucor, that's also certainly helping. So we see a small improvement as the year plays out in Long Products. And frankly, we see the same in some flat products. We believe that plate will be marginally better in 2013 than in '12. We see plate continuing to, both in volume and pricing, increase incrementally as we go throughout the year. Sheet is going to be the challenging product for us, and frankly, all forms of sheet, hot band, cold rolled, galvanized, electrical steels are all going to be very challenged.","Richard Garchitorena - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one other question on CapEx. You broke out the maintenance versus the growth. I was just curious; the CapEx for the EnCana JV, is that perhaps captured in the growth CapEx? And how does that ramp up in the coming years?","James D. Frias","It is captured in the growth CapEx. We haven't disclosed how it ramps up in the coming years. You can get an idea by looking at the 10-K filing. The contractual obligations table has a separate line for EnCana investments -- or excuse me, for our natural gas investments.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nate Carruthers with Steel Market Intelligence.","Nate Carruthers","I guess a little bit more on the sheet side. There's a new sheet mill being planned in Arkansas. Can you give us your thoughts about the facility and its impact on Nucor and the industry in general?","John J. Ferriola","There's a new sheet mill being built somewhere in Arkansas, being proposed in Arkansas. I haven't heard that. That was a joke. Well, listen, I'll start by making the comment that you've heard me make several times during the call. We have a tremendous overcapacity situation in the United States, in North America. There's absolutely no need for additional capacity. Now having said that, okay, if the plans move forward and it does move forward to getting built, it's going to take some time to get built. The last new mill that was introduced took about 3 years from the time that it was announced until they began production. If I remember correctly, it was about 3 years, maybe 3.5 years. During that time, Nucor's not going to sit idle. We'll continue to grow our product offerings. We'll continue to add to our value-added offerings. And if the mill does start up, we'll compete. We'll compete fiercely, we'll compete successfully. As I think back to the last mill that came online in the United States back in, I think it was around 2007, I remember hearing things about how Nucor would be most negatively impacted by that new operation because it was located in the South, close to our mills. And at that time we said that we would develop a plan and trust in our team to take on that new competition and compete successfully with it. All I want to say is you can see how all of that worked out, and if the new competitor continues to move forward, we'll do the same thing. We'll develop a plan, I can tell you. When they start up, they'll meet fierce resistance, fierce competition. We'll have the plan, we have the capability and most importantly, we have the team. And I've said this many times on many calls, I will put our team up against any team anywhere in the world. And I trust that they will compete and they will compete successfully. Those are my thoughts.","Operator","We'll go next to Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","John, when you were discussing the SBQ additions, I think you had 2 parts. The first was the upgrade of existing mix and then the second was the new production capability later in the year. Can you remind us of the upgrades to the mix and then what your new capability will be later in 2013 with the investments in Memphis, Nebraska and South Carolina, just from an absolute tonnage standpoint as well?","James D. Frias","I'm going to ask our Executive Vice President for the Bar Products, Jim, to handle that. Jim?","James R. Darsey","Okay, Jim Darsey. As Jim Frias stated earlier, our primary focus early on in our SBQ upgrade was to improve our product quality and to improve the value that we offered to the market, move up the value chain. Now those projects are underway in Memphis. We're installing 2 quality assurance lines there, one is an in-line quality assurance line and one is an off-line quality assurance line. The off-line one will start up in the third quarter of this year, and the in-line quality will start up in the fourth quarter of this year. Also, in Memphis, we're adding a second metallurgy furnace to improve our quality and provide the ability to provide higher grades of material. And we're also adding a second vacuum degasser hood where we'll have 2 complete stations for vacuum degassing. Again, our quality and moving up our ability to participate in higher grades of SBQ steel. At Nebraska, our project that we're focused on this year is updating one of our mills. We're going to add straightening, paneling and sharing and packaging equipment there, primarily focused on improving the quality of our product. The mill work will be completed this year. In 2014, we will be bringing on additional mill capacity at Nebraska. And at Darlington, we're installing a rod block there. Construction is well underway, and the rod block will be co-commissioned and started up in the early third quarter of this year. That is a product expansion there and we'll be producing rods from 7\/16 of an inch diameter up to 2 1\/8 inch diameter in bar and coil. And again, that project starts up third quarter of this year. So this is phased out. Our press release last year indicated that we will be adding close to 1 million tons of SBQ capacity. That it is still the case, but it's spread out over a couple of year time period.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it's 1 million tons of added melt and finished product capability, but you're also enhancing the mix at the same time?","James R. Darsey","Yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Lipschitz with CLSA.","David A. Lipschitz - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So 2 quick questions. How much was the impact of Trinidad in the quarter? Was it meaningful or...","James D. Frias","We don't have an exact figure, but it was probably in the $8 million...","John J. Ferriola","In terms of...","James D. Frias","No, as we give in terms of VC.","John J. Ferriola","In terms of VC?","James D. Frias","Yes, it's probably the $8 million to $10 million range in terms of vision contribution, which means around close to $0.02 per share.","David A. Lipschitz - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then just more of a theoretical question. You talked about the McGraw-Hill data, up 8%. If you look at that forecast, I think in the next 3 to 5 years, you get back to like a billion square feet or something like that over the next 3-plus years, something like that, which you said is still well below where we were in the mid-2000s. What kind of level of square footage do you think we need to get to where we don't really need to cut capacity or imports need to go away where we can get some -- people can get pricing power or to that effect? I mean, because right now, I mean, you're still -- like you said, even if it's up 8% this year, you're still less than half of what the peak was.","John J. Ferriola","Well, we don't really need to see it get back up to the levels that we have seen it in 2007, 2008. To some extent, that was almost an artificial time period, created on steroids, I don't expect to see again. But if it approached 70%, 75%, 80% of the peak levels of 2007, we'd be pretty pleased with where we are. We think that, that would support a strong market for both our Long Products and for our building products.","David A. Lipschitz - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And one final question. In terms of raw material prices, you're bringing down your raw material costs. Your competitors are trying to do the same thing. If iron ore, in my consensus, said that it is going to be at $100-plus or minus sometime next year, do we end up in a deflationary type of environment for prices for steel?","John J. Ferriola","Well, there's a lot of ifs in that question, that's for sure. Iron ore, I read recently articles that say iron ore will be $80 to $100. And I've seen just as many articles stating that iron ore will be at $150 to $160 a ton. So certainly, what happens with iron ore is going to have an impact on steel, the economics of steel production, but I'm not in a position to be able to say whether it's going to be a bull or a bear. My best guess would be, as we move forward, that you'll see some pressure on iron ore pricing. You'll see it will come down a little bit. I'm not sure it will come down to those levels.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, you have invested significantly a lot of money in your flat-rolled business to get more and more involved in the OCTG market and you have gotten some share. It was just wondering, if you look at the OCTG landscape, there is a bunch of capacity coming in and one can argue, is it good or bad for the OCTG market, where certainly it will create a significant amount of demand for the flat rolled in the U.S., but most of these guys are going to buy locally. And I was wondering if you have seen improvement in your market share or are you in discussion with any of these new projects and you think there would be an opportunity for you, a significant opportunity for you in there?","John J. Ferriola","Well, a couple of comments to start off. First, we do believe that there's a significant amount of OCTG coming online. We do believe that, that will create an opportunity for our flat-rolled mills, and we are certainly pursuing that very aggressively. There are some challenges, some headwinds that we have to overcome. One is the amount of OCTG imports that are flooding into the country. That's a challenge not only for that industry, but for us. But -- and we are working with that industry to take action to get that corrected [ph] . I was just going to make one more comment and that is this, that we are working with our existing customers and we're very aggressively working with potential customers to be their supplier. And as you mentioned, we have made quite a few investments in that business. We believe that we're very well prepared. The feedback we're getting from our customers and our potential customers are that they also believe we are well prepared to meet their needs in the future.","If there's no other questions, I'll make a few closing comments. First of all, I'd like to thank you all for your interest in Nucor. It's always appreciated. Ham, I'd like to take this opportunity to again thank you for all that you have contributed to Nucor and to the Nucor family. So thank you very much for 37 years of outstanding service. And thank you to all of our teammates. Thank you for what you do every day for Nucor, and thank you, most importantly, for doing it safely. Thanks again. Have a great day.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation.

Please go ahead, sir.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. We appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's leadership team, Jim Darsey, Jim Frias; Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman; Dave Sumoski, Leon Topalian and Chad Utermark.","The team in Charlotte would like to thank all of our teammates throughout Nucor for their excellent work in 2017. Your effective implementation of our five drivers to profitable growth strategy delivered Nucor's strongest annual earnings since the cyclical peak year of 2008. As always, you are working together to build a safer, stronger and more profitable Nucor.","The 25,000 men and women of Nucor are the reason our company's best years are still ahead of us. Thank you.","Our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias will now review Nucor's fourth quarter performance and financial position. Following those comments, I will update you on the execution of our strategy for long-term profitable growth. Jim?","Jim Frias","Thanks, John. Nucor reported fourth quarter of 2017 earnings of $1.20 per diluted share and full year 2017 earnings of $4.10 per diluted share. Fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings included a net benefit of approximately $0.55 per diluted share related to the impact of the U.S. federal tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter. Excluding the benefit realized from tax law changes, fourth quarter 2017 earnings exceeded our guidance range of $0.50 the $0.55 per diluted share.","Nucor's Steelmaking Operations, particularly our sheet and bar mills, achieved significantly better-than-expected results for the month of December. The Nucor team faced a very challenging marketplace in 2017. Finished steel imports increased 12% from 2016, driven by unacceptably high levels of illegal trade. Non-residential construction activity remained sluggish.","Nevertheless, Nucor delivered robust year-over-year profit growth and our highest earning since the cyclical peak year of 2008. We believe our 2017 performance provides strong evidence that Nucor's strategy for profitable growth is working. Over the past nine years since the 2008 cyclical peak, Nucor continued its long-standing tradition of investing opportunistically during downturns to grow long-term earnings power.","Here are some examples of how our strategic work during the downturn is now yielding returns. Nucor's sheet mills delivered strong earnings growth in 2017 and actually exceeded their prior earnings record set in the last up-cycle. Their performance benefited from major investments made during the downturn. That include our Alabama mills galvanizing line, our Arkansas mills vacuum tank degasser, our Berkeley mills Wide-Light project, and our acquisition of the Gallatin steel flat-rolled mill. All five of our flat-rolled mills continue to successfully move up the value chain."," Nucor's engineered bar mill group more than doubled their earnings contribution year-over-year in 2017 to a record level. During the downturn, we completed a $290 million investment program expanding our engineered bar production capacity and quality range at our engineered bar mills in Nebraska, Tennessee and South Carolina.","Our quality achievements were highlighted in 2017, when our Memphis facility became the only steel mill in the world to earn Caterpillar's highest-quality certification, The Platinum Level. Nucor grew its 2017 automotive market shipments by 7% year-over-year to 1.5 million tons of sheet and engineered bar products. That growth was achieved in a year when North American automotive production declined approximately 3%.","Nucor's growth is being fueled by expanding both our customer base and penetration of product platforms. Nucor Tubular Products, our newest growth platform, delivered strong profitability in 2017. Acquired in late 2016 and early 2017, these producers of hollow structural sections and electrical conduit provide an attractive channel to market for Nucor's hot-rolled and cold-rolled sheet steel.","Our tubular shipments exceeded 900,000 tons last year. We are encouraged by our 2017 performance. More importantly, it increases our focus on delivering the more substantial long-term payoff we expect from our team's hard work. Nucor's financial position is strong. With total debt outstanding of $3.8 billion, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 29% at the end of 2017.","After paying off the $600 million of 5.75% 10-year notes that matured on December 1, our year-end cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1 billion. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until April, 2021. For 2018, we estimate capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion. That represents a significant increase from 2017 capital spending of $450 million.","Approximately two thirds of planned 2018 capital expenditures are for expansion, product improvement and cost-saving projects, with the remaining one third for maintenance purposes. We have six particularly significant growth projects underway this year. First, a specialty cold-rolling facility at our Arkansas sheet mill. Second, hot- band galvanizing line at our Kentucky sheet mill. Third, a sheet galvanizing facility in Mexico being constructed with our joint venture partner, JFE Steel. Fourth, a rolling mill upgrade at our Ohio bar mill. Fifth, a rebar micro mill in Missouri. And sixth, a new merchant bar rolling facility at our Illinois bar mill.","In total, Nucor has announced approximately $2 billion in capital investments and acquisitions since the third quarter of 2016. We expect these projects to provide incremental annual EBITDA of approximately $400 million through normal business cycles.","Nucor's capital allocation priorities are clear, and they have been consistently practiced over many years. Our first priority is to invest for profitable growth. Our investment strategy is simple and flexible, leveraging our five drivers to profitable growth. Our second priority is to return cash to our shareholders, primarily with cash dividends, consistent with our success in delivering long-term earnings power.","Our February 2018 quarterly dividend will mark 45 consecutive years of increased regular or base dividends for our Company. Nucor is one of only 32 publicly held companies that have increased their dividend for 45 or more consecutive years.","Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase our stock when our cash position is strong and our shares are attractively priced. We intend to continue Nucor's long-term history of effective and balanced capital allocation. Over the 10-year period ended in 2017, Nucor returned $5.2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. These returns to shareholders represent approximately 36% of Nucor's cash from operations over that period.","Earnings in the first quarter of 2018 are expected to increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, exclusive of the benefit related to tax reform. We believe there are significant optimism in steel end-use markets and are encouraged by positive pricing momentum we are experiencing for all of our steel mill products. Coupled with these positive trends, first quarter of 2018 results will be negatively impacted by higher scrap prices and weather-related interruptions at some of our sheet mills.","We expect decreased earnings in the steel product segment due to typical seasonality. We expect first quarter earnings in our raw materials segment to improve compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Thank you for your interest in our company. John?","John Ferriola","Thanks, Jim. Nucor's disciplined strategy for profitable growth is working. As Jim noted, our 2017 earnings are Nucor's highest since the cyclical peak year of 2008. Here's a statistic that I find especially noteworthy. Excluding the net benefit of about $175 million we received from the recent Federal tax law legislation. Nucor's 2017 earnings were more than $1.100 billion. Those earnings are more than double Nucor's average annual earnings of $483 million over the preceding seven years, or from 2010 through 2016.","Let's take the analysis a step further and look at the steel industry environment in which we achieved our strong 2017 earnings. Two adverse factors of stand-out, first, the illegally traded imports remained a very serious problem last year. Finished steel imports captured an estimated 27% share of the U.S. market. Second, market conditions remained challenging for a number of major products produced by Nucor's steel mills, including beams, rebar, merchant bar and plate. Together, they represent about 45% of our total steel making capacity in 2017, or about 12 million tons.","At the same time, our downstream fabricated construction products businesses, with shipments last year of about 2,400,000 tons, were significantly impacted by the still sluggish nonresidential construction activity. This highlights an important point. Nucor's 2017 earnings performance was delivered without the benefits of all cylinders firing last year. Nucor's 2017 results were also impacted by unplanned outages we experienced at our Louisiana DRI facility.","With the unplanned outages, Louisiana's 2017 production was less than half of its weighted capacity. Louisiana's performance is unacceptable, and we are executing on a plan to change that. In late 2017, we began a top-to-bottom review of the Louisiana DRI facility. As we study potential process and design modifications at Louisiana, we are drawing upon both internal and a number of external resources. Our internal expertise includes our highly successful DRI plant in Trinidad. Trinidad is currently approaching world-class productivity performance to complement its longstanding world-class quality achievements.","Looking at our overall performance in 2017, the Nucor team is encouraged, but not satisfied. We are ready and eager to realize these significant pent-up earnings power we have built with more than $8 billion invested during the steel industry's lengthy downturn that began in 2009. That number includes capital spending of more than $5 billion and acquisitions totaling slightly less than $3 billion. As highlighted by Jim's review of our 2017 performance, we are already realizing attractive returns from our work to grow stronger during the downturn. We view this as just the initial return, with a greater payoff in the years ahead.","Our strategy for long-term profitable growth is simple and flexible. We are leveraging Nucor's five drivers to profitable growth, and they are: strengthen our position as a low-cost producer; achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio; move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher quality, higher margin products; expand and leverage our downstream channels to market to increase our steel mills base load volume for sustained results; and achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength.","I will now update you on highlights of our team's most recent work executing our strategy for profitable growth. Nucor's Sheet Mill Group is implementing three major growth initiatives. Our Arkansas mill is constructing a specialty cold rolling facility with an annual capacity of 500,000 tons and a capital cost of $230 million. This specialty mill is the only carbon mill of its type in North America, and it will be able to produce 2,000 megapascal steel. The new mill's advanced cold reduction technology will greatly expand Nucor's capabilities to produce lighter gauge and higher strength sheet steel products.","Start-up is scheduled for the first half of 2019. Our Gallatin, Kentucky mill is building a hot-band galvanizing line with an annual capacity of 500,000 tons and a capital cost of $176 million. The 72-inch galvanizing line will be the widest hot-rolled galvanizing line in North America. This project will position us to expand into a number of growing segments of the automotive market that we do not currently serve. Start-up is expected to begin in the first half of 2019.","Nucor and JFE Steel of Japan are constructing an equally-owned joint venture galvanizing facility in Mexico with an annual capacity of 400,000 tons and a total capital cost of $270 million. Nucor will supply half of the substrate requirements from our sheet mills. This investment will expand our participation in Mexico's growing automotive market, where we have been doing business for more than a decade. Equally important, we are excited to partner with a premier supplier of high quality steel products to the global automotive market.","Start-up is set for the second half of 2019. During the fourth quarter, we announced two major growth investments for our bar mill group. Nucor's bar mills are a cornerstone of our company. Capitalizing on our position as a market leader and a low-cost producer of merchant bar and rebar, they consistently generate attractive returns on capital and free cash flow through the economic cycles. Nucor will build a rebar micro mill just east of Kansas City, in Sedalia, Missouri. The expected annual capacity of the new micro mill project will be about 350,000 tons and cost approximately $250 million. Start-up is projected for late 2019.","A Missouri micro mill will enhance Nucor's position as the low-cost producer by capitalizing on significant logistical advantages. Rebar supply currently travels long distances into the Kansas City, Upper Midwestern and Plains markets. Strategically positioning this micro mill in Sedalia will give us a sustained cost advantage over other domestic steel producers supplying rebar from outside the region. We will also be able to utilize an abundant scrap supply in the immediate area provided by the infrastructure of Nucor's existing David J. Joseph scrap operations.","The second growth initiative is Nucor Steel's Kankakee's plan to build a full-range merchant bar mill. It will complement Kankakee's existing position as a major rebar producer in the Chicago market. A merchant bar mill will have an annual capacity of 500,000 tons with an estimated capital cost of $180 million. Startup is expected in late 2019.","Similar to the Missouri rebar micro mill, this project will capitalize on Nucor's position as a low-cost producer and benefit from multiple logistical advantages. Kankakee will displace tons currently being supplied by competitors outside the Upper Midwest region, which is the largest U.S. market for merchant bar. Kankakee will also take advantage of an abundant low-cost scrap supply in the region. Additionally, this investment will leverage Kankakee's excess melting capacity.","Nucor got its start as a steelmaker nearly 50 years ago in the steel bar business. As these two investments and our Marion, Ohio bar mills modernization project demonstrate, our bar mills are not only a cornerstone of Nucor's past. They remain an important platform for Nucor's future profitable growth.","Our long-term success as a steel bar producer reflects the adaptability and flexibility of our business model. That adaptability allows us to grow from a position of strength as we enter new markets and continually move up the value chain. The bedrock of that strength is Nucor's people and the Nucor culture. That remains our most valuable competitive advantage. Our team is both ready and eager to unleash the pent-up earnings power that we have built into our company during the industry downturn. That is why we are absolutely confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us.","We would now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Novid Rassouli, please proceed, from Cowen and Company. Mr. Rassouli, your line is open.","Han Zhang","Hi, thank you guys for taking my question. This is Han in for Novid. So just wondering if you could speak a little bit about where you see shipments and pricing for the steel mill products this quarter, given the current market dynamics. And just on the Louisiana DRI plant, just wondering if we should assume that the place \u2013 the plant will run better this year compared to 2017. And if there will be any additional CapEx spending related to the DRI plant going forward. Thank you.","John Ferriola","Well, to your first comment, we're not going to speak about individual pricing in an individual quarter. I'll just make a general comment. And as we learned at the end of last year, we saw pricing strengthening. That was encouraging. We are encouraged by some of the things that we see in the marketplace today, but there are still some headwinds out there in some of our product lines.","Clearly, our sheets and our SBQ business, our engineered bar business, is doing well. We expect that to continue. We continue to see some challenges on our other businesses. Plate, from a volume perspective remains challenged. And certainly, our rebar and merchant bar are challenged. So in general, we see pricing at the end of the year improving. We expect that to be stable to improving. Volumes will be about stable, and we're not going to go much further than that.","The Louisiana DRI plant, we said in the script that we are \u2013 we've hit the pause button. We certainly understand and agree that the performance that we had last year, and frankly, in the past, at Louisiana has been unacceptable. And we're in the process of doing a complete review from top to bottom of our operation there, both from a process perspective and from an equipment perspective.","In terms of commenting on what CapEx would be required to change \u2013 make any changes there, it's really too early to tell. We won't make any comment on that until we complete our analysis. And at that time, maybe by the next conference call, maybe by midyear, we'll be able to give you a complete update on what we're doing in terms of process and what we're doing in terms of equipment. But at this point, it's too early for us to comment. It's certainly too early for anyone else to comment.","I will say that we have brought in a bunch of external experts both on blast furnaces, on chemical plants and on DRI plants. And we have a tremendous amount of internal resource that we can capitalize upon. As you know, we have a plant running \u2013 a DRI plant running in Trinidad that's approaching world-class production levels and certainly at world-class quality levels. So we've got a lot of resource, both internally and externally, that we can draw upon to complete this analysis, and we will. And we'll give you a complete update when we have completed the analysis.","Han Zhang","Great. Thank you so much.","John Ferriola","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse.","Curt Woodworth","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon, Curt.","Curt Woodworth","John, can you help frame sort of the overall mix impact from some of the capital investments you're making on the sheet side? So the addition of the 500,000 tons of cold-rolling in galv. Where do you see your value-added mix going to, say, by 2019 or 2020 relative to what it was in 2017 on the sheet side?","John Ferriola","Well, strategically, we believe that our mix in sheet needs to be closer to the market mix at existed sheet. Today, we are a little bit under-weighted in downstream in terms of cold-rolled and in terms of galvanized, so we're focusing on those two areas. I would point out, if you look at the total \u2013 we in fact we consider our tubular business as also a downstream business. So if you factor in the tubular business, 900,000 tons to 1 million tons that we supply internally from our sheet mills, we're a little bit closer to that market mix, but we've got some ways to go yet. Certainly, the cold mill and the galvanizing line at Gallatin will get us closer to that market mix. We'll continue to move in that direction until we feel we are strategically balanced with the marketplace.","Curt Woodworth","Can you give us a sense of what your, say, cold-rolled or coated percent mix was in 2017 so that we have a better sense to model these?","John Ferriola","In terms of our internal mix, we\u2019re about 60% hot-band and 20% cold-rolled and about 20% galvanized.","Curt Woodworth","Okay. Great. And a second question on the steel mills segment on the cost structure. The conversion costs were up fairly significantly second half of the year relative to the first half of the year. And I understand there's been energy, electricity inflation. But can you comment on sort of how you see raw materials flowing into next year? Do you think that conversion cost would start to moderate at any point?","John Ferriola","Well, probably the biggest impact that we'll see in terms of conversion cost in 2018 will be on the electrode side. We expect electrode cost to go up, as we reported, there's a shortage of electrodes. And there's a lot of media talk about pricing and what's going to happen to it. Now we do have \u2013 we've got long-term contractual relationships with a lot of our suppliers, so at least, in the short-term, we'll be somewhat not that significantly impacted by the spot price increases as we will see in the second half of the year.","The good news is, and this is something that we're very happy about, that is that, in terms of volume commitments, we have the volume commitments on the contract to produce the maximum amount of steel that we have scheduled to produce in 2018. We have enough electrodes to do that.","So overall, in terms of the conversion cost, probably the biggest impact will be the electrodes. There\u2019s always a little bit electrical energy costs continue to go up. Gas costs might go up a little bit in 2018, with the price of oil up a little bit. That\u2019s the \u2013 electrodes would be a major impact. Jim?","Jim Frias","I would tell you that, sometimes when you try and compute our conversion cost, there\u2019s one factor that\u2019s hard to capture the value of, and that\u2019s scrap. Because we do publish what our use cost was, but that\u2019s not necessarily what\u2019s going through our P&L each quarter. So if you think about how we finished 2016, we had about 5.7 million tons of steel inventory, including scrap and all the steel that we\u2019ve made that we either had at our steel mills order downstream businesses. And that 5.7 million tons had embedded in it, the scrap costs that we purchased in the fourth quarter of 2016, which is a much lower value.","So we started out with some very low cost of scrap embedded in our inventory. So I think \u2013 if you\u2019re not factoring that into your conversion cost model, then you may be overstating the step up in conversion costs in the second half. That may be a factor in your analysis.","John Ferriola","And to go back to your question about 2018, though, on scraps, it\u2019s hard to predict what scrap is going to do long-term over the course of the year. But we think, over the next several months, we\u2019ll see a relatively stable. That means up and down a little bit, but we won\u2019t comment for the rest of the year on scrap.","Curt Woodworth","Okay. The metallics cost that you report, is the right way to think about it \u2013 for example, the $317 million this quarter that would flow through\u2026","Jim Frias","[Indiscernible]","Curt Woodworth","Okay.","Jim Frias","Some of it will flow through currently, but the majority, there\u2019s a lag of about a quarter.","Curt Woodworth","Right, okay. All right. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Matthew Coren with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Coren","Good afternoon, John, Jim. All you are doing well. Question, with some quick math, it looks like you put up an EBITDA margin for about 13% for the full year, which is, as you pointed out, it\u2019s the closest you\u2019ve come really since the pre-financial crisis levels. So if everything were to hold still from today for the remainder of the year, including the cost pressures that you just mentioned, how many more cylinders do you think you could fire in 2018? And how much could you estimate to be able to increase that margin versus last year?","John Ferriola","Well, a lot of that answer depends upon what happens in the market. As you adequately pointed out, we had a very good year in 2017, our highest earnings since 2018. And frankly, a record-setting year for our sheet business and for our engineered bar business. So good news on that. In terms of our other products, market will dictate how that grows.","You asked about our commitment to capital. We are committing another $1 billion this year to 2018 to capital spend and about maybe two-third of that will go to new products, cost-reduction projects, expansion of our businesses and so \u2013 anything you want to add, Jim, to that?","Jim Frias","No, I don\u2019t think so. I think you covered it.","Matthew Coren","Fair enough. Let me ask you a bit about the overall market and you say whether this is going to continue. It seems like a quarter ago we had this market pegged, auto slowing, non-res is fine, but not particularly exciting. Energy is great. The rig counts are holding steady. But you\u2019ve been watching your customers\u2019 behavior and temperament for a long time. What\u2019s materially changed? Are they coming to your sales team and showing that the demand they\u2019re seeing is that much better? Is there a particular enthusiasm within the certain buckets of end markets, like, our machinery manufacturers showing more animal spirits than they were six months ago, for example.","John Ferriola","Well, I got to tell you, frankly, of course, all of our products and most of our customers, we see optimism that we haven\u2019t seen in quite some time as \u2013 it\u2019s a very positive attitude out there. And clearly, our customers are coming to us looking for more commitments for 2018 in terms of volume. So optimism, overall, looking pretty good. So I would be \u2013 I would say that it\u2019s hard to predict exactly what the market would do as you go forward in the year. But right now, we see a great deal of optimism.","You mentioned the one area where we see a little bit of a retraction and that\u2019s in automotive. But I would point out that, although automotive production was down, as we said in the script, down about 3% in 2017, we increased our market share into that market by about 7% up to 1.5 million tons. So we continue to grow in that market and that\u2019s a reflection of the \u2013 our continuous movement up on margin and higher-quality products, higher-strength products, we continue to invest in that. Our cold mill, and our Hickman facility, our Arkansas facility, will be a huge step in getting us even further into that automotive market.","So we feel pretty good about the things going into 2018. Market seems good and there\u2019s potential for some better news coming out, we hope. We think the long overdue infrastructure plan; we hope we see some action on that early in 2018. Now of course, even if the President does take some action, it will be a while before it goes down to our businesses. But when you look at infrastructure and when you look at Nucor and just the breadth of our products, when we get that badly needed infrastructure plan, and we\u2019re going to get it someday because we need it someday, there\u2019s no company that is positioned better than Nucor to participate in that infrastructure build.","So again, we won\u2019t see the benefits right away, but when they do flow down to us, we will be positioned in our industry better than most to take advantage of that infrastructure build.","Matthew Coren","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Terry","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Mine is mainly around the tax reforms. Can you give us some guidance for 2018 on what you expect to be your book tax rate?","Jim Darsey","Yes, I\u2019ll take that. Go ahead.","Chris Terry","The second part of that is just around\u2026","Jim Darsey","I\u2019m sorry. We lost you on the second half of that. Are you still there? I\u2019m thinking we had a cell phone issue happened there. Well, let me answer the first part of the question. And if Chris is able to get back on the call, we\u2019ll talk about the second part of this question.","First of all, we obviously recorded a big adjustment at the end of the year. There could be some true-up adjustments as we finish doing all the accounting work around implementing the tax legislation, and some of those could be positive or negative. We really don\u2019t know. Otherwise, we have recorded something different. So there\u2019s some things that could trickle through. We\u2019re excluding adjustments as we finish the implementation and also excluding the impact of non-controlling interests. We would expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. So I think we lost.","John Ferriola","Yes, let\u2019s go to next caller.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Timna Tanners with Bank of America.","Timna Tanners","Hey, good afternoon, gentlemen.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon, Timna.","Timna Tanners","On the Q1 guidance, I just wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more detail. I was kind of surprised by the comments on the weather. It\u2019s not even third of the way through this first quarter. And already, you\u2019re telling us that sheet is going to be hit. Why sheet? What is it about this quarter that\u2019s weather-hit? And are we wrong in thinking that normally first half is pretty strong? So what is the seasonal commentary you\u2019re referring to?","John Ferriola","Well, that\u2019s really directed at what took place in January. We had a storm, as you know, freezing temperatures that impacted our operations at Berkeley. It also impacted our operations at \u2013 adversely impacted our operations for almost a week in Arkansas both at our Hickman sheet mill and our Nucor-Yamato mill. So, yes, it\u2019s early in the quarter, but we recognize that in the first month of the quarter, we\u2019ve had \u2013 if you look at kind of summarizing all of our operations and the weather impact, we\u2019re probably looking at an impact that \u2013 for the first month of the year, hit us pretty hard. So we just \u2013 we don\u2019t know what the rest of the quarter is going to bring, but just kind of making you aware that this is something that will impact the first quarter.","Timna Tanners","Got you. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I think a key theme so far in steel earnings has been just a lag effect on pricings and I think a shift broadly to more contractors, CRU Index business again. Can you just run through us \u2013 for us, like how we should think about that flow-through of price impacts across your businesses, if you would?","John Ferriola","Well, specifically, on contract business, it\u2019s \u2013 it would be our sheet business. And we this year we have about 70% of our total sheet businesses on the contract that\u2019s CRU-based. Most of it is adjusted on a quarterly basis or monthly basis. I can give you an exact breakdown of what percentage is quarterly.","Jim Frias","25%.","John Ferriola","25% is quarterly, and the rest of it is \u2013 the majority of the rest of it is monthly. So that gives you some idea. So we\u2019re relatively tied to CRU. On our engineered bar products, we are more tied to raw material. And in terms of our contract pricing, we saw 50% for 2018. And we have the last part of that is tied \u2013 as it has been forever, to our raw material costs there. So those are really the two areas where we have contracts going forward into 2018. Does that answer you question, Timna?","Timna Tanners","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then if I could, the last one. It was really great to see the detail on your capital allocation plans and some of the investments. Galvanized, we\u2019ve talked about in the past, somewhere, it seems like all the mills are adding capacity, and we\u2019ve had some worries about oversupplying that, although you\u2019ve pointed out there is growing demand. ","And if you could touch on that and then on the bar side, we\u2019ve gotten so used to low utilization of bar products and definitely as constructions have been coming out of it\u2019s trough, but why make the investment at bar if it\u2019s not been a great area of return. Is the return there enough to just \u2013 I mean I guess it\u2019s enough to justify the investment. But why \u2013 and what about the cannibalization of other bar mills you have if you are building new capacity.","John Ferriola","Actually very good questions. And when you look it \u2013 I\u2019m going to kind of start by putting the two of them together the galv question and you talked about bar but I\u2019m sure you are talking about rebar, given our announcements, to a less degree, merchant bar. When we look at our business strategically, and you look at those investments that we\u2019re making, frankly, it\u2019s not just more of the same. In terms of our galvanizing, clearly, one of the investments in Mexico, that opens up a new world for us. We\u2019ve been in the Mexican market quite a bit for the last several years, but not having in automotive and in terms of galvanizing, this puts some galvanizing boots on the ground right in Mexico.","So that\u2019s a geographical issue. In terms of our Gallatin galvanizing line, as we mentioned in the script, that will be the widest hot-band galvanizing line in the United States, and it\u2019s located right there in the heart of that market. So logistically, we\u2019ve got \u2013 we believe that we\u2019ve got an advantage to the marketplace there also.","The same is true of our rebar mill in East of Kansas City, in Sedalia. When you look at the location in terms of the market and in terms of the scrap availability, we believe that we\u2019re going to have a very good logistical advantage in terms of our product and in terms of our scrap supply. So we feel confident about that investment. In Kankakee, we\u2019re in the heart of the market. When you look at where the product is coming into that market from today, it\u2019s traveling great distances from outside of the region. We\u2019ll be right there in the heart of that market.","And you make a good point about whether or not we are cannibalizing our other mills in terms of rebar by adding this thing. But if you look at our overall what we\u2019re doing in Kankakee reducing the amount of rebar that we\u2019re producing, shifting some of that mill into merchant, adding merchant, so we\u2019re actually leveraging our hot metal that\u2019s available in Kankakee in terms of our investments there.","And then overall, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve done a market analysis. Frankly, of course, the United States in terms of rebar and in terms of merchant, looked at where our facilities are located and did an assessment, and frankly, a reassessment of where we want to be producing what products to optimize our logistics. And the investments that you see we\u2019re making today on the bar side are a result of that logistics and market analysis.","Timna Tanners","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Seth Rosenfeld with Jefferies.","Seth Rosenfeld","Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions on the domestic plate market, please. I recognized that plate pricing was pretty choppy during the course of 2017. I guess a bit surprise that you commented earlier that plate remains a challenge going into 2018, given the recent sharp rally we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of months. Can you just talk a little bit about the current status of the U.S. plate market, whether the recent price hikes have been successful, if they\u2019re sticking with customers or if you can comment it more broadly on the demand environment within plate. What areas are stronger? Which are perhaps still lagging across your customer base? Thank you.","John Ferriola","Leon, why don\u2019t you start off with your comment please.","Leon Topalian","Okay. Thank you, John. To answer your question, we saw shipment in 2017 actually improve about 12% year-over-year. As we look forward to 2018, we do see a modest improvement in market and then specifically some of those sectors \u2013 energy sector seeing some revival in quotes on the offshore drilling business, some refineries and some big line pipe jobs. We also see some OEM markets coming back and wind continues to be very strong, transmission poles and a few others. And imports because of our trade action and continued focus there continue to remain in check, and we\u2019ll continue to move forward on those fronts. But again, just the overall market, we do see improving in 2018.","And in terms of whether or not pricing is sticking, again, it goes back to the market, where \u2013 supply and demand we \u2013 the market will dictate our pricing. And specifically, we wouldn\u2019t make moves into the market in terms of price increases if we didn\u2019t believe they were sustainable.","John Ferriola","To Leon\u2019s point, he mentioned that the import picture is better. Imports are actually down, as we look at that. There\u2019s also some domestic capacity that has come off line in 2017. And you mentioned a couple of things that were up on demand, but I would also add to that heavy equipment has been improving, and mining has been going up. And so those are two areas where we can see some improvement in demand also. So my comments were in general, but we hope, as we go through the rest of the year, we continue to see improvement in that area, but it\u2019s still early in the year.","Seth Rosenfeld","Great. Thank you very much. And just one follow-up question separately within the steel product division. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing and margin dynamics in that business given the sharp rally we\u2019ve seen in some of the steel input costs there? How are you thinking about your ability to pass them onto customers and the strength of your order book going into 2018?","John Ferriola","Chad Utermark?","Chad Utermark","Thanks, John. Yes, we\u2019ve encouraged by what we are seeing in our backlogs year-over-year as well as what we're hearing from our customers in our downstream businesses. The non-residential sentiment out there continues to improve. Square footage activity is up. So we're encouraged as we head into 2018 with what we see in the non-residential construction market.","Seth Rosenfeld","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Phil Gibbs","Good afternoon. ","John Ferriola","Good afternoon Phil.","Phil Gibbs","Had a question, John, on automotive. I think you said, in 2017, you did about 1.7 million tons of shipments. Just curious and\u2026","John Ferriola","1.5 million. Just to correct you. 1.5 million. If I said 1.7 million, I misspoke. It's 1.5 million.","Phil Gibbs","And what was that relative to the 2016 base? And how much of that, roughly speaking, should we think about split amongst sheet and bar?","John Ferriola","First of all, that's about a 7% improvement 2017 over 2016. So, that answers the question about improvement. That is 1.5 million. As I mentioned a couple of times in the past, our goal is still to reach 2 million tons in terms of the split between sheet and engineered bar product. Of the 1.5 million tons, about 1.2 million of that is in sheet product.","Phil Gibbs","Thanks, John. And when you get the full gamut of your investments in \u2013 from 2018, 2019 in the sheet side that you're making here in the U.S. and in Mexico, is the primary driver to get to that 2 million tons moving that sheet capability up to that target?","John Ferriola","Our automotive is certainly one of the targets, but there's other targets that we are also focused on. HVAC would be another area that this would be useful in. The goal, in particular, in is to get into those ultra high-strengths steels that we believe not only are applicable to automotive now, but frankly, the light, high-strength steels we see are going to be in greater demand in automotive, particularly as the markets in automotive shift to maybe to electrified vehicles and other things like that as time goes on.","Phil Gibbs","Do you think, John, many of the EAF mills right now can make the light high-strength steel that you're talking about?","John Ferriola","Well, I'm not going to comment about what others can do. What I can say to you, and we said it in the script, that when you look at the specialty cold mill that we're putting in at Heckman, I think it's \u2013 in terms of the carbon specialty mills, it's one of three in the world, it's the only one in North America that will be able to produce ultra high-strength steels at very efficient levels. And that's really the key. It's \u2013 what we call a 6-roll mill that's able to be converted very quickly to a 4-roll mill. And that gives us the ability to reduce the number of passes to be able to get to those, a, light gauges; but b, also have the horsepower to be able to do the ultra high-strength at the very low gauges also.","So I'm not going to comment on whether others can do, but I'm very pleased with what we've done in our Berkeley mills in terms of the chemistries and the metallurgical improvements that we made to be able again, to do the high-strength steels that use that type of steel that goes into automotive today and with high margins. And I'm excited about what we're doing in our Decatur facility at that galvanneal. Very excited about the cold mill that we're putting in Heckman. So we've made a big investment and we're confident that we will reach our goal of two million tons by 2020.","Phil Gibbs","Thanks, John. I just had one more follow-up, if I could. If I heard you correctly, in the first quarter, you said that volumes on the steel side would be pretty stable, if I heard that right. I just wanted to make sure that, one, and then you did mention weather is an issue in some of your sheet mills, but are you seeing freight and logistics constraints right now given some of the driver shortages that we see? I just want to make sure I get the full picture here.","John Ferriola","You are correct on what you heard. We think that volumes will be basically stable, maybe slightly improved, okay, depending upon how things finish out the quarter. In terms of the logistical issues, there have been some. We\u2019ve taken very proactive steps to address that issue, so we're in a good position. Joe Stratman heads up our logistics team, so I'm going to ask him to make some comments on some of the proactive steps we've taken.","Joe Stratman","Yes, Phil. That's a great question. As John said, we're not immune to the supply and demand in the transportation space, but we really have not seen any issues yet. Logistics, for us, is not only a major cost issue, but it's also a customer service issue. So we've been focused beyond it, pretty hard for the last decade or so. In 2008, we actually established Nucor's logistics center, which is a group of transportation professionals based in Memphis. And they work side by side with our plant teams to coordinate activity across the enterprise. To give you some example, today in trucking, we actually own about 200 of our own trucks that we run every day.","In addition, we have about 100 dedicated contract trucks under \u2013 at our disposal. And we have over 1,000 trucking companies under a master contract agreement across the enterprise. You combine that with our geographical footprint and the density of plants we have across the country, we can allow our trucking companies a lot of reload or next-load opportunities. In fact, we have probably somewhere in the area of 20% to 25% of the trucks that leave a Nucor facility actually drop their load and reload at another Nucor facility.","In addition to that on rail, we own 2,700 railcars that handle both scrap and steel. And you might be surprised to know that 15% of our logistics costs actually \u2013 or tonnage volume, excuse me, actually transport on water. So we have long-term contracts with barge lines and ocean lines for our DRI facilities that have contractual arrangements for both availability and freight. So as the economy improves, we feel we're very well situated to maintain and control our cost but more importantly, service our customers.","Phil Gibbs","Terrific color and thanks Joe. Appreciate it.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets.","David Gagliano","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just had a question regarding the strategic investments and the outline that you provided today and then in some slides. The $2.1 billion of investments since the third quarter of 2016 that looks like $900 million obviously was tied to the two acquisitions, which were back in Q4 2016 and early 2017. And then the EBITDA target, $400 million. I'm assuming that's a kind of a mix of what we've already seen with the tube and plus what's coming. So I was wondering if you could just break down that EBITDA, $400 million, over the cycle, $400 million. How much of that actually flowed through 2017 results already via those two acquisitions?","John Ferriola","Well, the one comment I would make is on the tubular side. We've seen that pull through very, very quickly. So we've seen some of that in 2017. And we expect, the second part of your question, we're not going to break it down individually by project, but we are pleased with what we've seen so far with the investments that we made, particularly in tubular. Jim, did you want to add something?","Jim Frias","Yes Dave, I think that's a very good question. And in fact, if you look at \u2013 everything that's an acquisition, it's over $1 billion out of the $2.1 billion. And of course, acquisitions generate \u2013 you're paying a higher premium for the EBIT because they are immediately accretive in terms of cash flow. And so when we give the $400 million, probably, there's a bigger weighting that's tied to the capital expenditures than there is that's tied to the acquisitions. So it's more coming in the pipe than what we've already received. But clearly, we're getting the benefit of the acquisitions today.","David Gagliano","Okay. So is it roughly a reasonable weighting, say \u2013 I mean, $100 million flowed through so far\u2026","Jim Frias","I don't want to be that specific. I'd rather not be that specific. We don't break out that kind of detail.","David Gagliano","All right, okay. No problem. Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Piyush Sood with Morgan Stanley.","Piyush Sood","Hey, John and Jim, good afternoon. A couple of questions, are you trying to expand in the automotive sheet side? Could you talk about your raw materials sourcing strategy? Is the plan to those \u2013 most of the new iron units from Louisiana or you looking at domestic or imported HBA or pig iron? Or is it going more towards prime scrap? Just want to understand how you're thinking about it?","John Ferriola","Well, it's actually a mix of all of the above. We do use, fortunately, have part of the David J. Joseph Company as part of the Nucor family. So they're able to supply us with information on what's going on in the world. We always take a look at the economics of the materials that we\u2019re using, cost of the iron unit. So we do bring in some pig iron where that makes the most sense. We bring some of that in from Brazil. We bring some we\u2019re still getting any from the Ukraine, a little bit in from the Ukraine. But clearly, our overall long-term strategy is to focus on DRI and to use prime scrap from the domestic market. So DRI has always been part of the plan and will continue to be part of the plan.","Today, if you would to look at roughly our mix in terms of our sheet, it\u2019s about 15% to 20% pig iron, another 20% to 30% DRI, and the rest in prime scrap or obsolete scrap. That gives you some idea of the mix today, but DRI has always been part of our long-term strategy. It\u2019s going to be more and more important as time goes on. And the availability of prime scrap becomes more challenged, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, and not only big in terms of volume as manufacturing continues to move offshore.","There\u2019s less of it available. And as you continue to move through processing the prime scrap over and over again, you lose some of the quality of the prime scrap. So as we move forward, we think that our strategy of DRI is the right strategy. We will solve the problems in Louisiana. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind about that, and that\u2019s sort of how we view our automotive for raw material strategy.","Piyush Sood","So that HBI product that interests you or would you rather import more maybe prime scrap \u2013 or either prime, or let\u2019s say, pig iron?","John Ferriola","HBI has never really been a preferred iron unit source for us. It doesn\u2019t travel well, and frankly, does not outperform as well in our furnaces as pig iron or DRI, or frankly, prime scrap, for that matter.","Piyush Sood","Okay. Thanks for the color. And I have a follow-up. You had several high returns growth projects lined up. So how are you thinking about allocating capital to inorganic growth at this point? Is the bar higher now for acquisitions? And would it continue to focus on downstream so that it helps through more volumes?","John Ferriola","We take a look at what opportunities are in front of us and we evaluate them on an economic basis as they happen to be upstream, so be it. If they are in our core businesses, so be it, if they\u2019re downstream, so be it. Frankly, if it\u2019s outside of our mainstream, and it provides a good economic return, we would take a hard look at it.","So we\u2019re not limited by what it is, what the opportunity is. We focus on whether or not that adds value to our shareholders. And if it does, then we\u2019ll make the move on it. So one of the great things you\u2019ve heard us say several times our strategy is going forward, our strategic plan is simple, but flexible. So we can move in many directions. And the good news is we have financial strength to take advantage of whatever comes in front of us.","Piyush Sood","Thank you. That\u2019s very useful.","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. John Ferriola, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks, sir.","John Ferriola","Well, in conclusion, I would like to say thank you to our customers. We appreciate the opportunity to partner with you and to earn your business every day. Now we\u2019re excited and ready to join with you to seize new opportunities as we move forward. Thank you to our shareholders. We appreciate your ongoing confidence and your support.","And finally to my Nucor teammates, I want to say thank you for a great year. Thank you for the hard work you\u2019re putting into make it a great year. Let\u2019s keep it going. 2018 has the potential to be a better year. Let\u2019s work together to make that happen. And more importantly than anything else, let\u2019s make sure that we all work safely as we work towards that goal.

For opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Ferriola, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Nucor Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our Conference Call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's Senior Management Team. Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias and our other Executive Vice Presidents Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman, Dave Sumoski, and Chad Utermark.","Your leadership team in Charlotte would like to thank everyone on our Nucor Harris deal, David J Joseph, Duferdofin, Nucor Steel Technologies and skyline steel teams for your hard work every day to build a safer, stronger and more profitable Nucor and extremely turbulent global steel industry conditions we are taking advantage of Nucor's unrivalled competitive position and highly flexible business model to grow our companies long term earnings power while many of our competitors are fighting to survive, this protracted downturn more than 23,000 teammates are positioning Nucor to continue to thrive in the years ahead.","Jim Frias, will now renew Nucor's fourth quarter performance and financial position. Following his comments, I will update you on the execution of our strategy for long term profitable growth. Jim?","Jim Frias","Thanks, John. Fourth quarter of 2015 adjusted earnings of $0.46 per diluted share excluding impairment charges of $237 million exceeded our guidance range of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results included a LIFO credit of $218 million, somewhat higher than the $181 million LIFO credit projected in our guidance. The larger than expected LIFO credit increased our earnings for the quarter by approximately $0.07 per diluted share.","The biggest factor driving our fourth quarter outperformance was stronger than forecast results for the month of December at our steel mills particularly the sheet mills and our downstream product segments. Nucor continues to benefit from effective execution of our channel to market strategy and our ongoing investments to expand our offerings of value-added products.","At the same time, all of our Nucor teams continue their unrelenting focus on maintaining our position as the low cost producer across our extremely diverse product portfolio.","During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded two non-cash impairment charges totaling $237 million, a $153 million charge reduced the value of our equity method investment in the Duferdofin - Nucor steel making joint venture in Italy. In addition an $84 million charge was taken to write-off the entire amount of certain assets primarily engineering planes and equipment related to a potential blast furnace project at our St. James Parrish Louisiana site. Due to technology advances and other factors we no longer expect to use those plans if we proceed with the blast furnace project.","Including these impairment charges, Nucor's consolidated net loss for the quarter was $62 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Our deferred at the Nucor impairment charge reflects the ongoing financial performance and deterioration in near term projections for this business. The 50% ownership in Duferdofin - Nucor was acquired in July 2008 for approximately $667 million.","Although market conditions in Europe remain extremely weak, we are very pleased with the dedication and hard work of our approximately 700 teammates at Duferdofin - Nucor. They have achieved very significant improvements in costs and product mix. As one example, conversion costs at our [indiscernible] melt shop have reached world class levels.","Duferdofin - Nucor is also successfully expanding its portfolio to include value-added and more import resistant products such as engineered varieties [ph] blooms and billets as well as special profiles.","Across the entire organization, our Duferdofin - Nucor teammates have embraced and taken ownership of a culture focused on safety, environmental stewardship and production efficiency. All of these initiatives are focused on achieving consistent profitability for the joint venture in the near future. A quick comment about our fourth quarter of 2015 tax rate as it can be confusing due to the impact of profits from non-controlling interests and the impairment charges. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners and the two non-cash charges, the effective tax rate was approximately 31% for the fourth quarter.","Nucor continues to generate very robust operating cash flow in extremely challenging steel market conditions. With our highly variable and low cost structure, we benefit from significant reductions in working capital during downturns. 2015 cash provided by operations was approximately $2.2 billion, a dramatic increase from 2014s operating cash flow of about $1.3 billion. It also represents our strongest cash flow performance since 2008's record level of $2.5 billion.","Over this prolonged steel industry downturn that began in 2009, Nucor's annual operating cash flow generation has averaged approximately $1.3 billion. That compares with average annual operating cash flow of $500 million to the previous cyclical downturn from 2001 to 2003. 2015 capital expenditures were $365 million. For 2016, we estimate capital spending of approximately $500 million.","Depreciation and amortization for 2016 is expected to total about $700 million. Most of our recent larger scale organic growth projects have been completed or are nearing completion. Nucor's financial strength allows us to invest in capital projects and strategic acquisitions during severe industry downturns when the long term returns are most attractive. Through the downturn that began in 2009 and continued with a vengeance in 2015, Nucor has invested more than $6 billion to grow our long term earnings power that includes capital expenditures of approximately $4.4 billion and acquisitions totaling about $1.9 billion. Rather than fighting for survival, the Nucor team is executing our strategic plan for driving profitable growth and delivering attractive returns to our shareholders.","Nucor's disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation also allows us to reward shareholders with attractive cash returns on their investment. Over the 10 year period ending in 2015, Nucor has returned a total of approximately $6.8 billion of their capital to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.","With the dividend increase announced in December and effective with next year's quarterly payment, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 43 consecutive years, every year, since it first began paying dividends in 1973. Reflecting our success in growing long term earnings power, the base dividend has increased fivefold over the past 10 years. In December, we began repurchasing shares of our common stock under the $900 million program approved our Board in September.","Our repurchases totaled about 1.7 million shares at an average cost of just under $40 per share. Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the fourth quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $2 billion which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Our next significant debt maturity is not until December 2017.","Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which remains undrawn, the facility does not mature until August of 2018. Nucor is the only North American headquartered steel producer to hold an investment grade credit rating.","Market conditions for our stainless segment remain extremely challenging as a result of global overcapacity and import levels that remain at extremely high levels; however, we anticipate some improvement in the steel mill segment in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter 2015 due to a lower average cost of inventory to begin the first quarter, a small decline in imports and more balanced inventor levels at service center customers. The performance of our downstream steel product segment will be lower due to typical winter seasonality.","We expect downstream products for the full year of 2016 to achieve notably improved performance compared to 2015. Performance in the raw material segment should increase slightly over the fourth quart level as Nucor Steel Louisiana resumed production earlier this week following its extended fourth quarter maintenance outage.","Margins are expected to improve modestly in our scrap recycling business. We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable long term growth and attractive returns to Nucor shareholders. We appreciate your interest in our company. John?","John Ferriola","Thanks, Jim. I am proud of the results achieved by our teammates and one of the toughest steel markets in decades. Because of their work, Nucor is growing stronger and actually thriving compared to our peers. First, I will comment on the overall industry issues we face today. It is not an exaggeration to say that the global steel industry is in a crisis. The crisis is the direct result of foreign governments particularly China blatantly subsidizing their steel industries. In further violation of international trade rules, this glut of global steel production has led to the dumping of steel products into the U.S. market. Despite the highest level of domestic steel consumption since 2006, the American steel industry capacity utilization in 2015 was around 70% and pricing for most steel products essentially collapsed.","Nucor's culture has always been defined by our willingness to tackle challenges head on and focus our energy on what is within our control. To that end, Nucor continues to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing trade cases whenever and wherever it is appropriate. When foreign producers and governments break mutually agreed upon trade laws, there must be meaningful consequences. Nucor has joined other U.S. steel producers in filing trade cases for hot rolled, coal roll and corrosion resistant flat-rolled products. We are pleased that the International Trade Commission made preliminary determinations of injury in all three cases.","Regarding the preliminary duties announced by the commerce department, we are satisfied with the duties applied to products from China in the corrosion resistant and coal rolled cases but we are extremely disappointed in the other determinations and believe that the facts to support higher duties; however we are confident that the government will be more aggressive in its final determinations after further analysis is done.","Another important trade issue in 2016 is China's bid to gain recognition as a market economy under its protocol of ascension to the world trade organization agreed to in 2001. Over the past 15 years, China has failed to implement the reforms necessary to become a market economy. China remains a government run non-market economy today. There for, the U.S. has no reason to change its treatment of China as a non-market economy.","Great challenges provide great opportunities for great companies that are ready size them. At Nucor, we are more than just ready, we are doing it. We are on the offensive and growing stronger. Our multi-pronged growth strategy is simple and flexible. That strategy is supported by Nucor's five drivers to profitable growth which highlight where we are focusing our energies to build long term earnings power and provide our shareholders with attractive returns on their valuable capital.","Here they are, 1, strengthen our position as a low cost producer; 2, achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio; 3, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher quality, more import resistant products; 4, expand our downstream channels to market to increase our steel mills base load volume, especially in weak markets and 5, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength.","Our performance in 2015 provides numerous examples of how we are growing stronger in this downturn and positioning Nucor to deliver higher highs in profitability during the inevitable cyclical upturn. Despite the challenges, illegally traded imports and less than robust capacity utilization rates, our bar mills delivered solid profitability in 2015. The keys to their success are powerful and sustainable. Market leadership positions, strong channels to the market, and an unrelenting focus to drive costs lower.","Our fabricated construction products group achieved very strong year-over-year profit growth in 2015 and actually approached the record profitability reached in 2007. That is very impressive when you consider the fact that U.S. non-residential construction activity for 2015 as measured by square footage represents less than 60% of 2007's peak activity. In addition to their strong market leadership positions, Nucor's fabricated construction products enhance the through the cycle profitability and flexibility of our steel making businesses.","Our structural steel business also delivered attractive earnings growth in 2015 while working against strong headwinds from high import levels and low mill capacity utilization. Impressive results were delivered by all of our structural steel teams. Our Nucor Yamato model mill, our Berkeley County South Carolina mill and our piling distribution business, skyline steel, Nucor's ongoing success in the structure all steel business continues to be powered by our market leadership position, strong channels to the market and new product introductions that continue to move us up the value chain.","Our Nucor structural mill is continuing to expand it value-added product portfolio. In 2015, Nucor Yamato began shipping its wider sheet piling sections. These new products are already enjoying strong marketplace success. We see significant opportunities for profitable growth in this market which currently is largely supplied by imports. Further, during the second half of 2016, Nucor Yamato will begin commissioning its $75 million question and self-tempering projects. This investment will position Nucor as the sole North American producer of high strength, low alloyed beams.","Our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill achieved very solid fourth quarter and full year 2015 profitability in what can best be described as horrific flat-rolled market conditions. The Berkeley team continues to capitalize on their investments in vacuum degassing and the wide light capabilities provided by caster and hot mill equipment upgrades. New products from the wide light modernization are allowing us to gain new business in a wide range of end use markets including metal buildings, railcars, auto heaters, automotive, heavy equipment and motor lamination nation.","Of particular note, Nucor's automotive business continues to grow with work awarded by a diversified and high quality portfolio of automotive OEM customers. Highlighting Nucor's overall commitment to profitable growth in the automotive market and our strategic focus on commercial excellence, we opened a Detroit sales office earlier this year. Our shipment rate to the automotive market from our sheet and SBQ bar Mills increased by about 20% in 2015 versus 2014 to approximately 1.4 million tons. We believe the time could not be better for a financially strong and technologically advanced steel supplier such as Nucor to make a more significant contribution to the automotive industry.","In November we acquired Dallas [ph] cold finished bar facilities located in Ohio and Georgia. And the combined annual production capability of 75,000 tons, this acquisition strengthens Nucor's market leadership position in this very attractive value-added business and important channel to the market. I warmly welcome to the Nucor family all of our newest teammates in Orrville, Ohio and Cartersville, Georgia. Our list of five drivers to profitable growth begins with the objective to strengthen our position as a low cost producer. Nucor's DRI production capability with its excellent conversion cost structure has significantly strengthened our position as a low cost steel maker. It gives us the flexibility to optimize Nucor's overall iron units mix and most importantly, cost.","Consistent with our announcement earlier this month, our DRI plant in Louisiana has resumed operations and is producing high quality DRI. Recent changes in raw material pricing led to this decision.","These are challenging times in the steel business, but for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength, these are also times of great opportunities. Here is what I see throughout Nucor. The right people working with their typical high energy level and sense of urgency to seize these opportunities for profitable growth, ensuring that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. Thank you for your interest in Nucor.","We would now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Co.","Tony Rizzuto","John, my first question I just wanted to know on the trade side what gives you the confidence the final decision will bite harder and be more broad based first of all?","John Ferriola","Well let me start by saying that we take a hard look at the data and as we view the data, and as we have anxious to go back and present it to the commerce department we feel confident that we can prove a strong case and then came out in the preliminary. So we're pretty confident -- remember that during the preliminary findings they see only some of the facts presented by frankly on the countries that we are looking to gain some duties from. So they all see the whole picture.","We have an opportunity during this period to present our case and we're confident that when we get to present our case, and get a more balanced view in front of them they will come out with a stronger determination in the final determination.","Tony Rizzuto","In this environment provided that they do see a little bit more in the way of the industry and the final determination is little bit stronger. We still have obviously certain end markets which some call in recession and U.S. dollars still fairly strong raw materials at depressed levels. Can you envision hot rolled moving sustainably above $450 per ton?","John Ferriola","It's very difficult to project where pricing is known to go and let me ask maybe by addressing your earlier point that we do recognize that Nucor that despite our best efforts and effective trade cases to effective trade action, we recognize that because of the dollar there's always going to be some challenges on the import front which is why when you look at our strategy and how we have developed our products to move up the value chain, we have got a strategy that we use to help insulate us and much as possible from the imports. Higher value products that are harder to import. ","We continue to develop a stronger channel to the market that provides a nice barrier for us gives us some protection from the imports. So we're taking this from a two front battle, one we are continuing to fight the imports, the illegal unfairly traded imports let me be real clear about that we do not have a problem with imports. We have a problem with illegal unfairly traded imports. So we'll continue that battle and we'll continue with our strategy of moving up the value chain, gaining more market leadership position in the products in which we participate and to continue to develop our channel to the market.","Tony Rizzuto","And just talking a little bit further about that I was intrigued by your comments about market opportunities you and I wonder if you could talk a bit further about the opportunities you see to further penetrate the automotive and maybe HVAC. Is it possible to quantify the opportunities in terms of volume and margin potential that you'll see? Sounds like a lot of things you're doing--","John Ferriola","Let me address that from the automotive front because that's probably where we feel we have the greatest opportunity. As you know, that we've increased sales in automotive on a delivery bases by about 20% over last year. Today we're at about a 1.4 million ton a year market penetration. We fully expect to be able to get up to 2 million tons over the next couple of years and that's going to be in both sheet products and our SBQ.","As we continue in sheet and we move up the value chance into the advanced high strength steals, particularly when you think about what we've done on our Berkeley facility we provide light project that's given us the ability to continue to move even higher and the strength sheet steel products while maintaining the light gauge they need in the automotive applications. So we feel very good about our sheet penetration into automotive and I'll also point out that on our SBQ, we continue to develop more and more products and bear in mind Tony that as our team does a great job selling today automotive market and our products present great opportunities for the automotive customers, and let's be honest the automotive industry is taking a look at the entire steel industry today and they look at Nucor and our balance sheet and they see a long term sustainable supplier.","When you think about how they order steel, they order steel today, it takes a long time to get qualified and years to go through that entire process and then the steel they're ordering today could show up on a platform that's not even going to roll-out for two to three years from today so they want to make absolutely certain that after they've gone through the entire qualification period that when they roll that product out that new platform out in two to three years they want to make certain that their steel supplier is going to be there and able to supply the steel that they need to keep their factories running.","Tony Rizzuto","I wonder if you could comment I've been hearing about a competitor perhaps losing some people on the R&D side you know the heavy auto area in Michigan since you opened up that office out there I'm wondering if you might have been able to attract a few of those folks over to your shop?","John Ferriola","Let me just answer the question this way. The most qualified people out there are looking for companies that work for companies that they know are going to be around for the long term and all I'll say is when you look at the balance sheet and when these potential candidates take a look at our company one of the things they bring up towards all the time is that look we want to get with a company we know is going to be there for the long term and I want to finish my career with a company. Not only do they are impressed with our balance sheet but once they come down and spend some time with us they like our culture, like working for the concept of working for the Nucor family, so yes, we had great potential to attract the best people out there and having opened this office in Detroit.","I'm telling you what, that was a great move and I guess it was two months ago we have a grand opening I'll tell you Tony we had over 200 customers come by and talk to us and the one thing that we heard consistently through that two or three hour period was a major concern about the suitability of some of our competitors in this industry and they are anxious to do more business with Nucor as a result of that. We'll move on and give someone else a chance to ask questions, thank you Tony.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matt Murphy with UBS.","Matt Murphy","Maybe just picking up from there in terms of R&D and auto, can you summarize what some of the main steps, the mini mill industry have to do to make more in-roads on auto? What is sort of the key quality steps you've got to make and how quickly can you make them to make more meaningful in-roads.","John Ferriola","Well probably I'm going to speak just to Nucor because I can't speak for other competitors, probably biggest issue is getting through the qualification period. It's an issue of timing. When you talk about what products do we need to develop to be able to get penetration into it I would tell you that today we're producing just about all of the products we need to get our full penetration into automotive. On making advanced high strength steals, we have great quality steel going to the automotive industry, so where we need to be in terms of products today.","Now having said that what's good today is not good enough tomorrow so we need to continue to work on developing even more sophisticated grades that have higher strength while still maintaining flexibility or improved flexibility for the designs that are coming out in the future so there's always more to do but I want to be clear about this point. Today at least new cars [ph] in mini mill we can produce virtually every type of steel that's needed in automotive.","One of the questions I'm always asked is about exposed automotive quality and I answered this question several times but I'll say it one more time. Today we have the ability to produce exposed automotive that is actually out there on cars and went through a qualification period. So we're very comfortable with the products that we can supply and the quality that we can supply.","Now as I mentioned earlier, there's a very long qualification period and after the qualification period you have to wait for it to be introduced and your steel is being specified on so there's a period of time it's going to take to grow to this 2 million or better tons a year level with automotive but it's strictly a question of working our way through that time period now.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Olin with Rosenblatt Securities.","Chris Olin","Just wanted to talk a little bit about the rebar market and I know you mentioned December shipments were running better than you guys expected. I was just curious if you saw any order strength from the implementation of the new highway bill. Are you seeing public spending dollars starting to flow into your business?","John Ferriola","It's really too early to see much of an impact on the Highway Bill. Although we are really pleased the government after what's it been more than a decade of having short periods of time it's great to see them come out with a five year plan. Frankly we believe they need to go even further and have a longer term plan and the infrastructure of our country it is desperately needed and to answer your question directly, we haven't seen much of an impact right now. We expect probably in 2016 we begin to see some effect and we believe that we'll see a more significant impact starting in 2017.","Chris Olin","Just as a quick follow-up have you ever tried to calculate the potential market impact from the spending dollars like any thoughts on how much volume could be generated for the industry just from roads and bridge projects coming up?","John Ferriola","I don't know that we've ever tried to figure out an exact number but I'll tell you when you look at the product prep we have to offer, the type of products we have to offer not only you mentioned rebar but think about the plate applications that go into infrastructure. So we've got bar products that go in there, we\u2019ve got plate products that go in there and by the way don't forget a lot of this work is going into bridges and we've got great piling that we can offer to and we offer piling products that only we produce domestically and as I always like to say, when you're going to build a bridge we can supply every type of steel you need in that bridge and when all said and done we'll sell you the nuts and bolts to put it together from our fastener [ph] division.","So when I look across the spectrum of companies in our industry, Nucor, I believe is positioned better than most to take advantage and gain the most out of this Highway Bill as it comes into fruition and the dollars begin to flow.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank.","Chris Terry","Just after a little bit more detail in the CapEx outlook for 2016, I see you mentioned a number of 500 million and talked about 75 for Yamato. Just wondering how else or if you can give a breakdown of how the CapEx layout looks for the year?","Jim Frias","I'm sorry I missed the second half of the question.","John Ferriola","The question is we mentioned the 75 million in QST and we talk about a total budget of about 500 million. He's looking for a little bit more color on how the rest will be distributed. A couple of things we always have our maintenance CapEx which accounts for somewhere around 300 million to 350 million typically, is that a good number?","Jim Frias","That's right and there aren't as many large organic projects right now in the pipeline separate of the project at Nucor Yamato.","John Ferriola","But I'd mention one other and that's the heat treating project. We're adding heat treating capability at our Memphis facility and an earlier question was about automotive that will also help us move further into the automotive as we can heat treat our own product coming out of Memphis. Although we've already spent most of that money because it was more installing than spending fresh capital.","Jim Albrecht","But that's another project that we're doing. So those are the two that we can mention as John said, most of the large ones and we're kind of happy about it, most of our large ones were past the phase where we're spending the money, we're well into the startup and frankly past the startup and we\u2019re beginning to see some of the returns from these projects that we've invested in heavily and we mentioned several types the wide light project, we mentioned piling project. I'll mention the DRI project, so it's not to be past point where we will have spent on the existing projects.","Now having said that I want to be very clear that I can't give you any specifics as to what we're doing but there will be we believe that there's many opportunities both organically and through M&A activity to continue to grow our business and we're anxious to do that. Just because we're planning on a $500 million budget that doesn't mean that that's what it will be at the end of 2016.","Chris Terry","Is there anything else you wanted to say on the acquisition side or the competitive advantage, you've obviously talked quite a bit about the order space but specifically what sort of industries you're looking at there or what opportunities you actually see?","John Ferriola","Well I'll tell you what I'd love to talk about that but I don't want to go to prison but there's really nothing I can say about it other than I'll make this a general comment and it's going to go back to our five points of profitable growth, so if you look at those areas we talked about there are things in which we can continue to improve our market leadership position in the markets in which we compete so there will be things that strengthen our channel for the market that will be things that continue to move us up the value chain, our products up the value chain making them more import resistant and I don't want to leave out one of the most important ones.","That is we will continue to invest in our operations in ways that will continue to lower our cost of operation because at the end of the day, we're at a commodity business and we're in a global commodity business and the way to succeed in a commodity business in a Global Market place is to be the low cost producer so we will continue to invest below our cost of production which obviously was one of the big reasons we invested our $750 $780 million in our DRI facility so that's more of a general answer to your question but really all I can give you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners","I wanted to ask about your costs and about uses of cash. So just for starters, can you provide a little bit more clarity on your SG&A run rate since it dropped off sharply fourth quarter versus your run rate first three quarters of the year with 125ish and then it went to 84 million and similarly getting a lot of concerns over the LIFO swing potential into the first quarter. Can you provide more context for how to think about that?","Jim Frias","First on the SG&A, we are a pay for performance company. We have significant amount of our compensation across the company including profit-sharing for all employees that's affected by our profitability. So the impairment charges did result in a reduction of our obligations to incentive compensation. So that's the first point and that's why the second half run rate is different than the first half. The second point you asked about was remind me Timna.","Timna Tanners","Yes concerns over the LIFO swing.","Jim Frias","So on LIFO, it's based on where we have a view about where the long term raw material prices are going, so it's hard for us to predict what scrap it's going to do over 2016 so we begin every year with kind of a conservative view that scrap is going to go up some and we book some expense in the first quarter and that's what we're being more transparent about in our guidance regarding the first quarter but clearly, without knowing what the final outcome is going to be we will have some LIFO expense, it's non-cash but we will have the expense in the first quarter to position ourselves to move either way based on what really happens to scrap prices as the year unfolds.","Timna Tanners","Okay and then my other question was regarding uses of cash and I know you've already highlighted your five areas of focus and talked about what M&A might look like but if you could comment specifically on the buyback so we couldn't find evidence of much buyback since 2008 so does this mean this is a new focus for the company, that means you're not finding better M&A alternatives and therefore finding your shares as a better use of cash or can you talk to us a little bit about your thinking there?","John Ferriola","I'll be happy to address that. We always have three approaches to our capital allocation and let me make sure that I highlight the first one and the first one is to invest in profitable growth of our company. That is always our first focus and I want to be clear, Timna. We believe strongly that there are many opportunities to continue to invest in the profitable sustainable growth of our company both internally, organic and externally through M&A activity. So that's the first objective that will always be the objective.","Second objective in capital allocation is to make sure we return our shareholders valuable capital to them at an appropriate way. We look at dividend as being a very appropriate way to do that. We think it's a good dividend, well balanced dividend, look to maintain a prudent payout ratio between supplemental and our base and we look forward to the days like we had in 2005 and 2006 when we have such good cash flow coming in that we can increase the supplemental dividend and return more of the capital to our shareholders, so that's our second objective.","And our third objective as you mentioned when we can't beat either of the two first ones is to look at stock as a potential buyback and so those are the three areas we look at and I'll point out that there's a lot of questions about the cash and our cash position today and when you look at 2015, we generated a lot of cash in 2015 but I think it's the second highest that we've had since what about 2005? Highest since 2008 and we have a lot of cash on hand but let me be clear again we feel we have a lot of opportunities to spend it wisely in a disciplined manner, on a flexible disciplined manner to grow our company.","If we don't see opportunities out there that return the kind of capital, return on invested capital that we're looking for, then we'll do the prudent thing and return it to our shareholders or buy stock. Right now when we look the all three of those we saw it during the past month stock was a good opportunity and we bought some stock. It is definitely not a major change in our position or direction or anything like that. I want to be really clear about that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Phil Gibbs","I had a question on your sheet mix and how much shaft shipments last year went to the hot roll market versus downstream market any way you could help us think about that?","John Ferriola","When you look at our mix about 55%-60% goes T hot and the rest is pretty well split evenly between cold rolled and galvanized but basically I would say an easy way to remember the numbers which is what I need I'd use 60% hot band, 20% cold rolled and 20% galvanized and that's pretty close.","Phil Gibbs","And I was interested the comments on notable 2016 improvement in the fabrication piece of the business and given the fact that at least we were thinking there were some pricing resets occurring on maybe some rebar fab and potentially cold finished bar product, how are you thinking about the meaningful improvement is it volume related, pricing related, how do we get there?","Ray Napolitan","Well our improved profitability in 15 and expected in 16 is a result of a couple of things. Strong operational performance by our teams lead the way in my view with lower cost and we expect those to continue in 2016. We also continue to see improving demand for our products and services in our downstream businesses and we continue to lead the market in technology such as 3D modeling and again continue to add value to our products.","John Ferriola","I hope everyone understood the comment about the bin and that allows us to do and a sophisticated computer system we use that helps us design our building and what it allows us to do is to tackle and Bill more complex structures which are higher margin structures and also impacts our cost, so it has two very positive effects for us. So ready to hit them all on the head.","I think that I want to just make a shout out to my team and say great job guys, I'm really proud of the fact that if you look at all three of our downstream businesses, and we had a very good year we expect another one in 2016 and maybe a comment about our shipments in 2015 how they compare to the previous year given the fact that when you look at McGraw Hill the demand for non-residential construction was down 5-6%.","Jim Frias","The non-residential market was down in '15 about 5%-6% in new construction starts and backlogs and all of our key downstream segments are up and our shipments in 2015 were basically the same.","John Ferriola","Up a little bit than 2014.","Jim Frias","So the team did a great job even though demand was dropping we were able to maintain our shipments and we were able to improve our profitability. That's a formula for long term success right there. So great job, team, thank you.","Phil Gibbs","And then just the last one I had. You said the recent changes in raw material price lead to getting the DRI back on track. Just clarifying what you meant on that given that iron ore prices and pig iron prices have been relatively stable over the time frame so looking for more color and it's a again I've been getting a lot from investors. Thank you.","John Ferriola","Well the keyword you use is relatively stable and when we look at it and we see an increase of 20-$30 a ton on scrap and a $10 increase in pig iron that might be relatively stable but when you buy 15 million tons of scrap, and million 5 tons of pig iron that's a big change and we felt as we talked with our DJ Joseph team whose out there all the time working in the marketplace we felt we could attribute at least half of that to the fact we were taking a DRI plan off line and since we when we finished the maintenance outage at the end of last month, we were at a point where we had to make a decision as to when you're back on or not and we were basically breakeven on a marginal contribution basis and so we were kind of up in the air as to what to do.","We thought it was a good opportunity to leave it all and we've always believed that bringing it online had a significant impact for us on our cost of scrap and pig iron so we said here is an opportunity to take a look and see in fact what happens so we left it all, we saw a bump go up and it's about 25-$30 a ton across the spectrum on scrap and $10 on pig iron so again that's a huge impact for us, so we bought it back online because of that and I came away from the whole thing and the team came away from the whole thing more convinced than ever that although you might not see immediate profitability in the DRI plant itself when you look at the overall impact to our company, on iron units which represents 60% of our costs the overall impact to our company is significantly better wanting that DRI plant than not wanting the DRI plant even if it is not profitable in its own right.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Lane with Morningstar.","Andrew Lane","First just from a housekeeping perspective, my apologies if I missed it I heard the comment about 300 to 350 million of maintenance CapEx but what's your full year CapEx guidance figure and then also for DNA?","Jim Frias","The depreciation amortization is about $700 million and the CapEx is about $500 million based on the things we have planned today.","Andrew Lane","And wanted to ask about scrap flows, how are you seeing scrap flows currently in the recycling market and what do we immediate to see a significant improvement in scrap flows for your recycling operations to restore positive margins?","Joe Stratman","Scrap flows over the last 60-90 days have been basically flat but on a year-over-year basis, they are still down running down probably 25-30%. The second part of your question, I think let me take a shot at looking at it this way. Our DJJ business model is a very diverse business model and we some types get caught up in thinking that it's only a recycling business with scrap yards but we have five or six different business elements in our DJJ business and the recycling group alone as a part of that only represents about 15% of the DJJ revenue flow so the DJJ business model performance financial performance does not rely on the recycling group.","For the recycling group to see improvements, really all you need, it's not as much flow based as much as you need stability the pricing. In other words for most of 2015 we are seeing significant drops in the market price for scrap and that's kind of like catching a falling knife. You can never really catch up with it. Once price is stabilized or shows any sign of increase then that is what drives margins and profitability at the recycling group more than just volumes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Yu with Citigroup.","Brian Yu","First question is this touches on your auto comments a little bit earlier a bit broader but with the various blast furnace Operators out there that the contract prices reset lower but they aren't giving any indications of whether or not they've lost business in that process and I know you've mentioned your auto shipments are going to improve.","If we just look at the broader contract picture and the billions you have done business within the pastor new ones you've got were you able to win in new customers going into 2016 and is it possible to give us an order of magnitude like how much more does that base load your order book for this year?","John Ferriola","Well I can only talk in terms of what I've already said in terms of the amount of tons we are selling into it, so our order entry rate will result in about 1.4 million tons we sold in 2015 and we think it will be up a little bit in 2016 in the order of 1.5 or 1.6 but we do think over the next two to three years based upon the interest we have, people that are working with us on qualifying our products we feel very comfortable in saying that we'll be up in the 1.9 or 2 million-ton a year range within the next couple of years.","Brian Yu","I was thinking more broadly than just auto and appliance producers, and machinery company, I think John in that case the 2 million-ton number is right for next year versus in two or three years the broader market.","John Ferriola","If you take the entire market I'd say we're looking at about 2 million tons of contract business next year.","Brian Yu","And then what is that versus what you did in 2015?","John Ferriola","It was a little bit less not significantly less, maybe improvement of about 10%.","Brian Yu","And second question I've got is this goes back to the fabrication business and you guys have noted profitability is up, shipments were sideways and pricing is down a little bit. One thing and not taking anything away from your team there but steel prices did come down a lot so I'm thinking that maybe the drop in steel prices did improve margin?","John Ferriola","We were remiss in not mentioning that and absolutely correct and Frank little I apologize because one of the notes I have said steel pricing and we forgot to mention it but I have to tell you that we looked at this carefully taking that into account and we're very comfortable saying that still our team did the great job on lowering the cost exclusive of our steel costs and we're confident that the other things we mentioned played a large role in the picture the profitability picture.","Jim Frias","John, if might add and adding value to the construction projects we work on. And through our channel to market and with our customers so our team has done well in that area but certainly to reinforce reduced steel prices certainly helped in 2015.","Brian Yu","Okay, the other part of my question was just that you are guiding for increased profit ability in 16 it sounds like you're getting better prices, above your input cost in 16 versus 15 and then on the volume side are you looking for pick up in volumes out of the downstream business in 16?","John Ferriola","Well the only thing I can tell you on that is we look at our order entry rate and we look at our backlogs okay? And we feel the backlogs are very strong, order entry rate is strong, our best estimate today is we'll see an improvement of 5-6% in our businesses in 2016 versus 2015. And if you'll look at the pundits, the McGraw Hill and so forth they are saying 6-7% improvement we think across the industry that might be a little bit aggressive but we think in our business we will see 5-6%.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Garrett Nelson with BB&T Capital Markets.","Garrett Nelson","There's been some data suggesting there's been a bounce in domestic steel capacity utilization rates over the past month or so. Is that consistent with what you're seeing across the industry and should we expect to see a rebound in Nucor's volumes with utilization appearing to be moving up and with imports in inventories having come down a bit?","John Ferriola","You kind of answered the question for me. Imports are coming down a little bit, in addition to imports coming down the service center inventories are down a little bit, so bottom line is yes, we do see our utilization rates increasing as we go into the first quarter and also remember that we are moving into a period where we come out of fourth quarter is usually the weakest quarter in terms of the steel business so we're kind of coming out of that quarter, first quarter, second quarter we see typically see utilization rates and we think we'll continue to see that. You mention the slowdown in imports.","You mention the reduction of the inventory in our service centers but I'd also mention to you there has been quite a few shutdowns from some of our competitors that we believe we'll see some improved utilization as a result of that also. And also, we're seeing a small bounce in pricing and when you see a bounce in pricing typically that gets things going again.","Customers when pricing is going down kind of waiting until they hit the bottom and we've increased pricing in several products and those price increases have been holding so we feel pretty confident we've stopped the slide and we're moving back up. Customers see that also and order entry rates go up.","Garrett Nelson","In the past you've said Nucor's goals is to control 6-7 million tons in scrap substitutes. Is that still your goal or has your thinking changed at all-in light of the drop in scrap prices we've seen over the last several quarters?","John Ferriola","Frankly our thinking has not changed at all. We still see that as a key long term strategic goal. I've said this several times at Nucor all of our strategies are pointed towards long term sustainable profitable growth and at the end of the day we still believe very, very strongly that I'm not sure whether it's going to be five years, seven years or ten years, but, we believe that as a result of the manufacturing decreasing in the United States and several other things, we will be glad we have that DRI plant. Just remember one other thing. We're very heavy into pig iron and that's very important to us and right now we get about 80% of our pig iron out of Russia. The rest of it is coming out of Brazil. Those are not the most stable places in the world geopolitically.","HBI which is another potential product we could use as a scrap substitute comes out of Venezuela and that's also not a very stable geopolitical area so when you look at all of these facts and you look at our goal of being flexible, long term having flexibility and balance across our portfolio and a cyclical business whether scrap pricing is cyclical, iron ore is cyclical, pig iron is cyclical, steel pricing is cyclical when you look at that I believe the key to long term stable returns to our investors the best way to accomplish that is to have a nice balanced portfolio and flexible portfolio that allows us to move things around as we need to optimize the lowest cost product inputs and optimize our margins coming out of our Mills.","So long winded answer to your question but no our strategy hasn't changed. We believe it's the right strategy and we'll continue with it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Aldo Mazzaferro with Macquarie.","Aldo Mazzaferro","I noticed how sharply your scrap costs fell in the Fourth quarter and I note also though that it's been lagging the index on the industry if you take some of the published numbers and I'm wondering your comment on the first quarter low scrap would help you in first quarter do you think there's a chance you'll see even if the index is say flat to slightly up in the First quarter versus the fourth, the actual cost of your scrap that you consume probably goes down a little bit?","Jim Frias","Let me start that. You're right there is a lag between the index and our performance because we always have some scrap inventory we own at our steel mills so the indexes don't reflect what we're consuming they reflect what we're buying so you're right the bottoming of the scrap prices that happen during the Fourth quarter are going to benefit from some of that to start the First quarter. ","Aldo Mazzaferro","Jim one other follow-up the large LIFO yesterday the you took in the Fourth quarter does that help or would that lower the average cost of scrap in the first or would that actually keep it higher?","Jim Frias","It does not go through the scrap line so it doesn't affect the scrap costs we published at all. It's in the corporate line we show the segments in fact.","John Ferriola","There might be one thing I'd want to add to your comments and that is you have to lock at that by segment, right? Because when you look at our bar Mills we have a lot less scrap on the ground.","In fact some of our bar Mills just because they are geographically challenged, we don't have a lot of room some of them happen as little as two to three weeks of scrap on the ground and then you take a look at our sheet mills and not only do they necessarily have to have more on the ground but it's a different mix and the mix they use will depend upon the mix of products they are producing so it's a very complicated process that you go through but the impact that you mentioned Jim will occur more on a larger plate and sheet mills, just to give you a little more color.","Aldo Mazzaferro","One more question, separately is there any way you could comment on your lead time in the sheet products and the long products?","John Ferriola","We can do that. I know hot band is the shortest lead time we're probably only out a couple weeks three or four weeks in hot band but when you look at coal rolled and galvanized we are probably held to March towards the end of March for our cold rolled and galvanized.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Lipschitz with CLSA.","David Lipschitz","So you might have answered this a couple questions ago but a couple of your competitors have taken impairment charges on their facilities I was wondering where do you guys stand with DJ Joseph?","John Ferriola","Well we aren't going to answer that question directly. What we will say is that we do it, we do our impairment testing every year and we always look at all of our operations and we're comfortable with where we are with that and I'm going to refer back to what Joe said earlier about the business model at DJ Joseph being different.","We aren't going to comment on what our competitors have done in terms of breakdowns, but when we look at our business model as Joe mentioned, it's much more than recycling and in fact the vast majority is out of recycling and when we look at our brokerage, we look at how they are performing we're very comfortable that we are well within the range of having a level of impairment.","Jim Frias","And Dave if I can add John's absolutely correct and when you look at that mix within what we call the DJJ business, the recycling components can be a little bit cyclical but the non-recycling components provides a very, very stable and very, very healthy earnings and cash flow stream, so it's that diversity adds a lot of strength to the value of the DJJ model.","Operator","With no further questions I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Ferriola for any additional or closing remarks.","John Ferriola","Let me conclude by saying thank you to all of our customers. We really appreciate the opportunity to earn your business every day and if we are blessed with your business we won't let you down. And thank you to our shareholders. We appreciate your ongoing confidence and support.","It means a lot to us. And to my teammates, I want to say thank you for creating customer value, generating attractive returns for our shareholders and building a sustainability, a sustainable future for all of us and most importantly, thank you for doing it safely. Thanks for your interest in Nucor. Have a great day.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","Certain statements made during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The words we expect, believe, anticipate and variations of other such words and similar expressions are intended to identify those forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and information that is currently available. Although Nucor believes that they are based on reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that future events will not affect this -- their accuracy.","More information about the risks and uncertainties relating to these forward-looking statements may be found in Nucor's latest 10-K and subsequently filed 10-Qs, which are available on the SEC's and Nucor's website. The forward-looking statements made in this conference call speak only as of this date, and Nucor does not assume any obligations to update them, either as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Ferriola, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President of Nucor Corporation. please go ahead, sir.","John J. Ferriola","Thank you. Good afternoon. This is John Ferriola, Nucor's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor.","With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's executive senior management team: Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey, Keith Grass, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan and Joe Stratman.","First and most importantly, we want to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit, Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for your excellent work taking care of all of our customers during a challenging first quarter with harsh winter weather in most of the areas where we operate.","The more than 22,000 men and women of the Nucor team got the job done, as they always do, by working safely, working smart and working together. Nucor's teammates, the right people, are our company's greatest asset and our greatest competitive advantage.","In addition to the operational excellence they demonstrate each and every day, our teams have been working hard to grow long-term earnings power. We have invested significant capital in recent years that we expect to convert into higher highs and profits over the next up cycle. The 2 key drivers to the anticipated profit growth will be reducing our raw material cost and expanding our product mix to include more value-added, higher-margined offerings.","I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to review Nucor's first quarter performance and financial position. Following Jim's comments, I will update you on our progress implementing our strategy for profitable growth. Jim?","James D. Frias","Thanks, John, and good afternoon. First quarter 2014 earnings of $0.35 per diluted share included unfavorable tax adjustments totaling $0.04 per diluted share. This charge was not factored into our guidance earnings range of $0.30 to $0.35 per diluted share.","First quarter results also included a charge of $0.02 per diluted share related to the disposal of assets within the steel mills segment. This charge was factored into our guidance.","A comment about our tax rates as it can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting out profits belonging to our business partners and the onetime tax adjustments, the effective tax rate was 34.4% for the first quarter of 2014. Over the balance of this year, we expect our effective tax rate, after adjusting out profits belonging to our business partners, to be in the range of 34% to 35%.","As John noted, our performance was achieved despite the impact of the most severe winter weather conditions in a decade experienced in many parts of the country. The resulting challenges were numerous. Deliveries of raw materials to our facilities and our shipments to customers were hindered by railcar and truck availability. Costs were increased, especially for energy, and customer demand was disrupted as more than half our end-use demand is directly tied to construction activity.","Most importantly, our teammates in all of Nucor's businesses applied their can-do attitude and energy to taking care of our customers. We view our industry-leading operational flexibility and reliability as critical pieces of the value package we deliver to our customers every day.","First quarter 2014 total energy costs at our steel mills increased by about $7 per ton from the prior quarter. As a partial hedge to these higher costs, the profitable output of our natural gas working interest investment represented approximately 68% of the total consumption of natural gas at our steel mills and our Louisiana DRI plant in the first quarter.","Total start-up costs for the first quarter of 2014 were $20.9 million. This included $20.7 million in start-up costs for our DRI facility in Louisiana. That number was higher than we expected. Overall, we are pleased with the progress of the Louisiana DRI plant. John will provide further comments in our progress in Louisiana.","Nucor continues to benefit from its position as North America's most diversified manufacturer of steel and steel products. Year-over-year earnings improvements were achieved by a number of our businesses. In our steel mills segment, profits increased at our sheet and plate mills. In our steel products segment, profitability improved at our joist and deck, cold finished bars and fastener operations. In our raw materials segment, the DRI facility in Trinidad and David J. Joseph Company scrap processing business reported higher earnings.","At the end of the first quarter, Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our total debt-to-capital ratio was 36%. Cash and short-term investments totaled $1.3 billion. Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.5 billion unsecured, revolving credit facility is undrawn, and it does not mature until August 2018. We have no commercial paper outstanding.","Our next significant debt maturity is not until 2017. Nucor is the only steel producer in North America to enjoy the extremely important competitive advantage of an investment-grade credit rating.","Our financial strength is a significant competitive advantage. It allows us to invest aggressively during downturns to grow our long-term earnings power, which is a strategic initiative of Nucor. During the steel industry's current lengthy downturn, Nucor has invested in a broad range of strategic investments. We are building upon our critically important competitive advantages that include our low-cost and highly flexible production capabilities, our diversified product mix and our market leadership positions.","With these investments, we are extremely well positioned to capitalize on the inevitable steel industry's cyclical upturn. Our focus remains on realizing attractive returns on Nucor's invested capital, which currently exceeds $9 billion. We are confident in our teams' ability to continue Nucor's record of being an effective steward of our shareholders' valuable capital.","As we discussed on our last conference call, we expect significantly lower capital expenditures for 2014. The majority of our growth projects will be completed in the first half of this year. Also, the temporary suspension of drilling new wells or our natural gas working interest investment reduces Nucor's 2014 capital spending by about $400 million. We continue to estimate our 2014 capital spending will be approximately $600 million.","For the second quarter of 2014, Nucor's earnings are expected to show some improvement over the first quarter, excluding the unusual charges. We expect increased profits at both our steel mills and our fabricated construction product businesses.","We also remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for nonresidential construction activity in 2014. This outlook is tempered by excess global steel capacity and the ongoing threat of steel illegally dumped into the United States.","Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance in the final month of the quarter. We do appreciate your interest in our company. John?","John J. Ferriola","Thanks, Jim. I am encouraged by our performance in the first quarter of 2014. We delivered solid earnings given the significant challenges outside of our control.","The 2 big challenges this quarter were the weather and ongoing pressure from imports. Our team also made excellent progress during the quarter, implementing our strategy of investing for long-term profitable growth.","The biggest reason that I'm encouraged is that I see strong evidence that Nucor is beginning to realize initial payoffs from our hard work through this protracted down cycle to grow our long-term earnings power. We have invested our shareholders' valuable capital in numerous projects that provide us new, higher-margined product offerings, cost reductions and quality improvements.","After starting up operations just last December 24, our Nucor Steel Louisiana team produced 455,000 tons of DRI during the first quarter of 2014. During the quarter, the facility attained peak operating rates above 90%.","Most importantly, the quality of the initial output has been outstanding. Louisiana has already attained world-class quality, with metallization rates of 96% and carbon content exceeding 4%.","I would like to thank everyone on our team in Louisiana for their excellent progress in the first quarter and their unrelenting commitment to continuing the hard work required for completing the job.","As Jim mentioned, Louisiana's costs were higher than expected during the first quarter. That's not unusual for the early production at a new facility. We are pleased to report that the performance of the equipment has actually exceeded our expectations. As was the case in starting up our DRI facility in Trinidad 7 years earlier, our work is now focused on process adjustments to improve the initially high product yield loss that is inevitably part of start-ups. Our Louisiana team has identified a number of such modifications to reduce yield loss that will be made during a 3-week shutdown planned for June.","The start-up of the Louisiana DRI plant is a major step forward in the implementation of our raw material strategy. We view our expanded DRI capability to be a game changer to Nucor's long-term cost structure for the high-quality iron units we need to expand our share of the higher value-added sheet, SBQ bar and plate markets. It also improves our operating flexibility with a significantly shorter and more secure supply chain for high-quality iron units.","In the first quarter, Nucor Steel Berkeley successfully started up its wide light capital project, providing Berkeley with the capability to produce wider and lighter gauge sheet steel. In fact, the Berkeley team has already exceeded the equipment's gauge reduction performance guarantees on every grade of steel produced so far. I congratulate and thank the Berkeley team for their hard work delivering, on budget and on schedule, an exciting new growth project for Nucor in the flat-rolled steel market.","The wider and lighter product portfolio will allow Nucor to move up the value chain in agricultural, automotive, heavy equipment and pipe and tube applications. This successful start-up is also timely in supporting the Nucor Sheet Mill Group's work to gain profitable market share by developing new, advanced high-strength steels.","Our team is aggressively going after the opportunity to develop advanced high-strength steels that provide customers with weight reductions comparable to alternative materials, but at significantly lower costs.","In the first quarter, our Nucor Steel Hertford County plate mill shipped a record 56,000 tons of value-added plate products. During the downturn, Hertford County invested in a heat treat facility, a vacuum tank degasser and a normalizing line. These investments continue to pay off for us, with the higher and more stable margins offered by heat-treated products.","Our expanded plate portfolio also has allowed us to increase capacity utilization at our Tuscaloosa, Alabama mill by more efficiently distributing work between our 2 plate mills. Not coincidentally, Tuscaloosa set a new quarterly shipment record in the first quarter of 2014.","Our Nucor-Yamato structural mill is on schedule for a summer of 2014 start-up of an approximately $115 million project to expand its sheet piling production capabilities. As part of the project's work, one of Nucor-Yamato's rolling mills will have a 3-week outage during the second quarter. The new wider and lighter products will move Nucor-Yamato up the value-added chain in the piling business. They will also allow us to realize more synergies from our highly successful 2012 acquisition of piling distributor Skyline Steel.","Congratulations to the team at Duferdofin-Nucor, our joint venture long products business in Italy, on the successful start-up of a revamped ladle metallurgical furnace, a vacuum tank degasser and a revamped 4-strand caster. These investments will allow Duferdofin-Nucor to diversify its markets, so it is less dependent on construction by increasing its product offering to the energy, transportation and yellow goods markets, thereby improving their results throughout the business cycle.","Our Nucor teams' work to build sustainable long-term profitability requires that we take a proactive role in our nation's trade policy debate. Global steel production overcapacity is the greatest threat to Nucor and to our industry. Illegal government subsidies from China and other countries have allowed large amounts of cost-inefficient capacity to stay in production and dump steel into the global marketplace.","Imports have significantly increased their share of the U.S. market during the current downturn. Imported steel share of U.S. market increased from 25% in 2009 to 30% in 2013. And over the first 2 months of 2014, their share has increased to an alarming 36%.","Given the indisputable fact that mills in the United States are among the lowest-cost producers of steel in the world, this makes no sound economic sense. They come here not because of demand, but in many cases, because of foreign producers' excess capacity, unfairly traded pricing and illegal subsidies they enjoy from their governments.","We should also understand that the damage done by dumped steel impacts the entire U.S. economy. Illegally traded steel and steel products destroy jobs, the type of middle-class jobs that our economy desperately needs to get back to healthy and sustainable long-term growth. Nucor is working hard to bring attention to the need for our government to enforce rules-based trade.","Several current trade case filings underway are of critical importance to Nucor, our customers and other U.S. steel producers. They include rebar, pipe and tube products and wire rod. The 22,000-plus members of the Nucor team urge both the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Committee -- Commission to closely examine the evidence as they prepare their final determinations on potential duties for these cases.","Whether it's structural long-term threats, such as illegally traded imports, or other more short-term challenges, such as severe weather in a particular quarter, the Nucor team always runs toward the challenge, not away from it.","We run towards the problem and get to work solving it, and not just solving it, but creating from it opportunities for our customers, shareholders and teammates. I can tell you that, that attribute of our culture and our DNA is why I'm more confident than ever that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us.","We would now be happy to entertain your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michelle Applebaum with Michelle Applebaum Research.","Michelle Applebaum - Michelle Applebaum Research Inc.","So my first question for you is, you're throwing out some numbers that you -- that sound terrific about what's going on at DRI in Louisiana. But I'd like to ask you, and then I have another question. I'd like to ask you to put into perspective for us what some of these numbers mean? And probably one great perspective would be, how does this start-up compare to the start-up of -- or I should say, the restart of Trinidad when you did that?","John J. Ferriola","Well, as I mentioned in the script, our Louisiana plant start-up, we believe, went very well, and particularly when we compare it to our Trinidad start-up 7 years ago. To begin with, the Louisiana quality targets at start-up were higher than those in Trinidad. At the beginning, when we started our Louisiana plant, our quality targets for metallization were 95.5% and our carbon percentage we were looking for was 4% or better. And that compares to the quality targets at Trinidad at start-up of about 95.5% -- 93.5%, excuse me, 93.5% and about 2.5% carbon. So we started out with higher-quality targets and it's important to note that Louisiana achieved their quality targets in a single week. In 1 week, they reached the quality targets that we had set. And it took Trinidad about -- just to put it in perspective, it took Trinidad about 5 weeks to achieve its quality targets. And in terms of the -- achieving the nameplate daily production, Louisiana reached its daily production nameplate target in 11 weeks versus about 26 weeks for Trinidad to reach its nameplate daily production. And bear in mind that Louisiana's facility's a 2.5 million ton furnace, the largest operating in the world. So this was a first-time event in the production of DRI. Now Trinidad certainly was a big start-up, and we had some challenges there, but it was the restart of an existing facility that had been operating. So it faced a few less challenges. So overall, I would say that -- and I'd also point out that being the largest furnace in the world, during the start-up process, we set daily production records for DRI production out of a single furnace virtually every day during the course of the quarter. So overall, when I look at the start-up of the Louisiana facility, particularly as I compare it to the start-up of the Trinidad facility, our team in Louisiana did a great job, and we're very pleased, very, very pleased with the start-up. Now the team still has more work to do...","Michelle Applebaum - Michelle Applebaum Research Inc.","Okay, great. My second...","John J. Ferriola","And we need to focus on the process in Louisiana, not unlike what we had to do 7 years ago in Trinidad, and we have to focus on improving the yield loss that's associated with the start-up in the process.","Michelle Applebaum - Michelle Applebaum Research Inc.","Okay. My second question is on trade. So we just had the preliminary decision in rebar, and some people are saying that it's partial good news because Mexico had tariffs that were meaningful, not great, but Turkey didn't get much of anything. And I'm just wondering here, and you know I've been observing trade for over 30 years now, and it's something that when you do steel, you spend a lot of time talking to lawyers. And I just can't help but wonder if a failed trade case, a 0 tariff, isn't so much a nontariff as much as an endorsement of what the other guy is doing, a.k.a. sort of a license to steal. And if that's the case, do we have a bigger problem coming between Korea and Turkey now, both in situations where they are essentially being given a kind of a free pass?","John J. Ferriola","Well, let me start out by saying, Michelle, that these are preliminary findings and that Commerce is not scheduled to give its final determination on these cases until September. I believe it's September of this year. So between now and then, believe me, we will be working hard to convince them to reevaluate their position on Turkey. It's also important to note, though, that Commerce did find, okay, that the producers in Turkey and Mexico were, in fact, dumping into the U.S. market. And in addition, Commerce found critical circumstances for some, although not all, of the foreign producers. Given the surge of imports that we've seen this year, we believe that Commerce should have found critical circumstances for all of the foreign producers dumping into our market. So we're disappointed. We're pleased with some parts of the ruling; we're disappointed with others. We're going to continue to work with Commerce and the ITC to get a better ruling when they have the final determination in September. I got to tell you, I'll go on the record as saying it, we believe the department should have made decisions based on the evidence given in the record that would have produced higher margins for Turkey. And we will continue to work in Washington to express that opinion, utilizing all the strength of all 22,000 of our teammates.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Gagliano from Barclays.","David Gagliano - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. My questions are actually into trying to drill down a bit more into the economics on the DRI side from Louisiana. If I look at the average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton figure of $398 for Q1, what was the cost of the DRI per ton that's embedded in that $398 number?","John J. Ferriola","Well, we're not going to go into those specifics. Clearly, I can tell you our competitors would love to hear those numbers. I will tell you -- I'll make just a couple of general comments, as I made during the -- during my comments in the script, that we will continue to focus on the process. We will continue to improve our -- reduce our yield loss as part of the process. And as we continue to do that, we'll reduce our costs associated with the production of DRI.","David Gagliano - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, okay, understood. How much -- sorry, how much of the 455,000 tons that was produced during the quarter, how much of that was actually consumed at the steel mills during the first quarter, maybe all of it?","James D. Frias","David, just a side note, the costs at Louisiana really weren't a factor in the number you quoted because we sell DRI from the -- directly to the steel mills at a market price. So Trinidad operates and generates a profit based on selling pricing costs. And in fact, low competing raw material prices caused Louisiana to sell the materials at a low competing price with pig iron and busheling. So that was a factor in the performance in the quarter. But that number you're quoting reflects a market number.","David Gagliano - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, okay. Understood.","John J. Ferriola","To address your second question, I don't have a specific number of how much was shipped out. But what I can tell you is that our mills are receiving it. They are consuming it at a rate of about 30% to 40% of the total charge, and they are extremely pleased with the performance of the DRI in our furnace. And in fact, it's performing slightly better than what we expected in some areas. We've seen significant energy savings as a result of the DRI. Furnace lining life has improved as a result of the coating that the DRI is providing in the process, and the electrode consumption has gone down with the use of DRI. So we're very, very pleased. Our teams are very, very pleased with the way that the DRI is performing in our furnaces today.","David Gagliano - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And I apologize for asking the same question a different way here. But I'm just trying to get to the economics, a little bit more color on the economics around how DRI is impacting the profitability. So I guess given that it's sold at a market price, is there a way to give us a sense as to whether, after the cost and the sales transfer price, was that a -- overall, was that a positive or a negative contributor to the result? And if so, can you -- is there a way to frame how much...","James D. Frias","Well in my script, I talked about what we've identified as pre-operating and startup costs for Trinidad and it was just under $21 million.","John J. Ferriola","For Louisiana.","James D. Frias","For Louisiana, excuse me. For Louisiana in the first quarter. And again, there's 2 factors: one is, the startup costs -- excuse me, the -- optimizing the conversion cost, especially relating to yield, as the mill's ramped up to its full capacity and now we fine-tune them to actual process controls; and the second factor is the commercial market it's operating in. And when we started Trinidad -- excuse me, yes, when we started Trinidad back in 2007, it was competing with materials that had a much higher selling value. So the fact that it had not yet optimized its costs wasn't as obvious and it made money right away because it could ship the materials over at a much higher price.","John J. Ferriola","Now as we continue to go through the year, we will focus on the process, as I've mentioned. We will improve the yield loss that's associated with the process, and we expect the financial performance to be much stronger towards the second half of this year. As I mentioned in the script, we're going to be shutting down for 3 weeks in June to make some modifications, which is not unexpected, again, in the startup of a new facility, particularly one that's the largest in the world, the first time that we're operating one that large. So we're going to be shutting down. So it's about 3 weeks to make some improvements that we believe will have a significant impact upon the yield loss associated with the process. Reducing the yield loss obviously is going to have a major impact on the cost profile of the facility. And as Jim mentioned, okay, even given the current low market price for competing raw materials, we believe in the second half of the year, we'll perform much better financially.","David Gagliano - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Do you believe it'll be profitable in the second half of the year?","John J. Ferriola","We do, yes. Again, given the current competitive raw material picture, we believe that raw material is pretty much at a low point. We don't think they would get much lower, but again, if that happens, then you've set a new benchmark. So given the current raw materials remain constant going into the rest of the year, we believe that it will be financially positive, profitable, in the second half of this year.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Curt Woodworth with Nomura.","Curtis Rogers Woodworth - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","On the long product side, John, it seems like we've seen kind of mixed trends with respect to bar and beam pricing. It seems like the beam pricing has started to decouple a little bit from the scrap price, but rebar remains relatively depressed. I'm just wondering do you think that's a function of relative demand strength in non-res more benefiting beam or more the import side hampering the rebar pricing?","John J. Ferriola","Well probably a little bit of both, okay? In terms of the rebar, demand was hurt in the first quarter, obviously, because of the weather conditions. And we do see, as we go into the second quarter, a small improvement in demand that's tied to residential construction improving, again, modestly, and from an extremely low level, okay, but improving. But that's offset by this issue of imports that we've talked about in the script. So without a doubt, although we see a small improvement in demand, it's being -- the pricing is being adversely impacted by the imports. On the structural steel side, on the wide-flange beams side, we see demand also improving marginally, but we don't have that same import pressure. And therefore, pricing has been a little bit more stable.","Curtis Rogers Woodworth - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And last question on the M&A strategy. I saw that Steel Technologies has acquired a small processor, I think, a couple of days ago. Is that kind of the beginning of a broader trend for you guys looking at more downstream or processing capability?","John J. Ferriola","Well we always look for -- it's a case of us finding an opportunity that fit well with our strategy of going downstream. It fit very, very well with our steel tech operations. It was a great bolt-on type operation, did not require a major change in management and a lot of additional cost to it. And it's one of our more profitable downstream products that has been very strong throughout the downturn, frankly, and it's a result of the automotive strength in some other markets that are pretty strong. So we saw an opportunity to get a great company at a good price. It was a good bolt-on operation, and we took the opportunity.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sohail Tharani with Goldman Sachs.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask you on this downtime or are you going to take in the third week of -- in June for 3 weeks? Do you have any idea what kind of costs should we associate with that in our model?","John J. Ferriola","Yes, you're talking about the 3-week outage that I mentioned for the DRI facility in Louisiana?","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes.","John J. Ferriola","The cost will not be significant. There's some changes we'll be making into the furnace, but they -- we will not be incurring major costs associated with that. And then there'll be some costs primarily associated with the conveyor systems. You might recall from an earlier call that in Louisiana, we have 4.5 miles of conveyor systems. And just as a point of reference to Michelle's earlier question comparing it to Trinidad, Trinidad has about 1.5 miles of conveyors. So when you have that much material handling, we're seeing some yield loss as a result of the impact of dropping the material from one belt to a transfer house to another. So we're going to be going in and doing some work softening the transferring of the material. It's not expensive work. It's just a bit time-consuming. We'll also be making some adjustments to the internal structure of the furnace, which, again, minor cost, but a bit time-consuming. So we're estimating a 3-week outage. Minimal cost, but we will be down for 3 weeks. And I'll mention before the question is asked that we fully anticipated this, and we've been building our raw material stockpile to take it into account. So we will have sufficient, high-quality iron units on hand to get through, to weather through this 3-week downturn.","James D. Frias","Sal, as a side point, pre-operating start-up costs were mainly related to Trinidad and the balance we expect - for Louisiana, I kept saying Trinidad -- for Louisiana. And the amount we expect in the second quarter is going to be more in the $10 million to $15 million range, depending on how quickly Louisiana is able to get the yield improvements that they're working on right now.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","$10 million to $15 million in 2Q?","James D. Frias","Yes.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Helpful. Jim, did you mention in your prepared remarks in very early sentences that half of your volume is tied to non-res? Is that correct what I heard?","James D. Frias","Generally, that's true, yes.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I want to ask...","James D. Frias","[indiscernible]","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, go ahead.","James D. Frias","I think I said more than half, but go ahead.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","More than half, okay. I want to ask you about the gas project. The gas projects have been steadily going up, and I think people are view that it may last for a while. And I'm wondering are you properly hedged or does it make sense to rethink about starting drilling or you think that you are already committed not to drill this year and you can't change that decision?","John J. Ferriola","Well we're comfortable with the level that we're hedged, certainly, through this year, and we'll evaluate what we're going to do as we enter into next year. To give you some perspective on that, what we're getting out of our wells, relative to what we're consuming at our furnaces in Louisiana, on average, we were drilling -- we were receiving about 100,000 MMBTUs per day during Q1, okay? And right now, our usage at that the Louisiana facility running pretty much full out, we're consuming 75 million to 80 million MMBTUs per day. So that just gives you some sense of where we stand today in terms of our coverage of gas needs in Louisiana. Now, obviously, as we go through the year and we start some of the depletion on the existing wells, that will change, we're comfortable with the level that we're hedged through this year. We'll reevaluate what we're going to do in the way of drilling next year based upon how we see pricing going forward and other factors.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And when you talked about your loss at the Louisiana plant, if you benchmark it against the Trinidad plant, how far are you off? Are you 10%, 15% below or you think more than that?","John J. Ferriola","We think it's about 3%, okay? And I will -- but again, I want to point out that when we started the Trinidad plant, the yield loss was more in line with what we're seeing today at Louisiana. Now having gone through the process improvements in Trinidad, we've been able to reduce it. And frankly, we plan to reduce the yield loss in Trinidad even further by the startup of a [indiscernible] that's currently being installed.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","What is the typical lead loss, by the way -- ideal yield loss you would like to see in a DRI plant?","John J. Ferriola","I'd like to see 0.","James D. Frias","0.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But what is achievable? Let's put it this way.","John J. Ferriola","I would say that somewhere in the neighborhood of 2% to 3% is probably a good goal. Now, of course, when I talk to our team in Trinidad and Louisiana, I will be saying I made a mistake on the call and I'm really looking to achieve is 1.5% to 1%.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nathan Littlewood with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just had a few questions, a couple have already been addressed. But could you talk a little bit about some of the market share opportunities you might be seeing at the moment in relation to the blast furnace outages -- or not outages, but sort of ramp backs?","John J. Ferriola","Well so if I'm understanding the question correctly, you're asking me about are we seeing a demand pickup based on some of the struggles that our competitors are seeing in the marketplace?","Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Correct. If you could just talk about what sort of products that might be in, what, sort of end market, that sort of stuff.","John J. Ferriola","It's primarily in sheets, okay, that most of the difficulty has been occurring. And we're seeing it across all of the sheet markets. It's been a little bit of a challenge for them. We've seen incremental pickup in our orders. We've had customers coming to us looking for additional tons, and we've had new customers coming to us looking for tons. Clearly, as they do, we have been servicing them as we can, as we have the ability to do. But of course, we're not looking for a short-term commitment from them. We are looking to build upon this short-term need by -- frankly, by requesting and, frankly, insisting that we get a longer-term commitment from them on the supply of steel.","Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Do you think that, that will be successful in terms of sort of what you're trying [indiscernible].","John J. Ferriola","Now we've already seen success, frankly, on it. Over the last several weeks, we've picked up quite a -- we picked up some incremental business and, of course, with that, some additional market share and, again, in areas of automotive and others, pipe and tube, for example -- excuse me, OCTG and others. Now the situation is still playing out, okay? So we don't know exactly what's going to happen, but we suspect that we'll see a challenged supply side market on sheet at least through the second quarter.","Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it, okay. Second one was just again about DRI. I recall you talking in the past about pig iron being the natural substitute for this DRI material. I'm just wondering based on what you can see at the moment in terms of raw materials pricing, is pig iron still the right material to be substituting at the moment? And the second question, I was just thinking more broadly about the operation of this facility. I'm trying to understand how quickly you guys can kind of move your raw material procurement strategy to take advantage of different price spreads between all those raw materials. So if, for example, 1 week, we saw fair scrap prices drop by $20 or $30 relative to pig iron at DRI, HBI, whatever. How quickly could you kind of change your raw material blend to kind of take advantage of that?","John J. Ferriola","Frankly, at a moment's notice. Our furnaces are extremely flexible, and I've mentioned several times that one of the key benefits we see of our DRI strategy is it gives our team the ability to do substitutions as the raw material costs change. And given the flexibility of our furnaces, now we basically charge our furnace from heat to heat, from batch to batch. So we can make those changes very, very quickly and we have a great team, our David J. Joseph Company, that's continuously out there, getting a great sense of what's happening in the market. They look at what's happening with pig iron pricing. They look at what's happening with prime scrap markets. We know what's going on with DRI. We look at HBI. And frankly, we even look at obsolete scrap. So at the end of the day, if obsolete scrap drops to a very low level, we can put more obsolete scrap into our furnace and achieve the same iron unit quality by putting more DRI into the furnace. So to answer your basic question, we can change mixes into our furnace on a heat-by-heat basis. So almost instantaneously we can change them, and we keep enough inventory at our plants to be able to change that mix on a regular basis. And in terms of looking out into the future to build the inventories, our teams are always -- our team at D.J. Joseph, through their trading arm, have a great deal on what's coming down the pipe in terms of pricing and we can adjust for future demands also.","Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it, understood. And just, I guess, to round out Dave's questions a little bit further, I know you were talking about a year or so ago about potential savings on this DRI plant of about $100 per ton in terms of DRI, the pig iron substitution. We've obviously seen coking coal come off a lot, pig iron prices come down. If you were to reforecast that $100 today, what do you think the number would be?","John J. Ferriola","Well one of the things that we have on our website that's available is the calculator for just that purpose. It just gives you the ability to plug in different iron ore pricing and coking coal pricing in the price of gas per MMBTU. And when you do that, you can get a good comparison between the final cost of the liquid iron coming out using DRI and\/or out of a blast furnace. So I would suggest, I don't have the math in front of me right now, but I would suggest that, that you use that tool to take a look at it. Certainly, coking coal is at an unusually low number. I don't know the current number today. The last time I looked it was, last week, I think it was about $115 a ton, somewhere in that ballpark. Keith, is that about?","Keith B. Grass","$115 to $120.","John J. Ferriola","$115 to $120. And iron ore is also at a very low level, about $125, $126, a little bit lower, somewhere in that range. So these are unusually low numbers and, frankly, it's a result of demand for steel worldwide slowing down, the slowdown in China. Now that's going to change. When we talked about the advantages that we saw in the DRI project a year ago or 1.5 years ago, we were looking at it relative to the competitive raw material cost at the time, and we were looking at it in relation to the other products that you mentioned, coking coal and so forth. So things change, and we've always said consistently that whether the DRI facility in Louisiana is a single or a grand slam, is going to be a result of factors that include -- strongly include the price of competitive raw materials and the pricing of the commodities that go into blast furnaces to produce competitively priced iron units.","Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is there any updates that you'd be able to offer in terms of commitment to the Phase 2 plant?","John J. Ferriola","We get asked that question every time. Let me make sure I understood the question. You're asking were we willing to make a commitment at this time to when we would proceed with a second DRI facility?","Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Correct, yes.","John J. Ferriola","Well, as I said in the past, no. Not at this time. We're continuing to look at it. We want to get the first one up and running and stabilized. And then we're going to take a look at the environment with all the factors that I mentioned earlier and make the decision on when it's appropriate to move forward. I will say, as I always add as a caveat, we have the land, we have the infrastructure, we're gaining the knowledge and we'll be ready at the right time.","Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Understood. And just a final one, circling back on the trade case stuff that Michelle was asking about earlier. I guess we were pretty surprised at how big the Mexico tariff was, or duty was, and also surprised at how low the Turkish number was. When you think about your sort of involvement in the case over the next few months and, I guess, the dagger and analysis that you'll be sort of contributing to that, is there any sort of data points or analysis that you could kind of refer to or talk about that might give us confidence that maybe those Turkish duties are going to be increased relative to the preliminary decision?","John J. Ferriola","Well all I can tell you is that, again, the final determination will come in September. Between now and then, the appropriate agencies will be taking a hard look at the, what we call, the in-country verifications to make sure that what was testified to in the hearings is, in fact, the accurate information. Now we believe that, that, as we look at the data that was put into the record, that they should have had higher duties applied, and we'll be pushing that issue. Of course, it's -- the ultimate call is Commerce and the ITCs.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm going to be bold here. I'm not asking about DRI or trade cases. But it seems to me that there's -- but there's 2 things that I thought you kind of glossed over, if you don't mind my saying so, on the script. And one is that you said you are aggressively going after the opportunity to pursue high-strength lightweight steels. And, I mean, I'm sure you've heard that the aluminum folks are talking aggressively as well about their opportunities, but what does it mean for Nucor to be going after this aggressively? What does that mean? Are you qualified? Are you sending volumes to the auto industry? Can you help me just understand how to think about that or model that opportunity going forward?","John J. Ferriola","Certainly, well I'll make some comments. As I mentioned, we're continuing to develop and to seek qualification of advanced high-strength steels. We continue to make significant strides in the exposed automotive applications. We're in various stages of qualifications for both cold-rolled and galvanized, exposed parts with imminent supply agreements at hand. Some new, as I mentioned on the last call, Timna, some Nucor sheet is already in use for exposed applications. And we tend to focus on sheet, but there's other areas of automotive that we're going after, too, and that's in the SBQ. And we've developed products that are currently in use in crankshaft steels. We are producing actual steels for the automotive industry in our facility in Norfolk, Nebraska. We're developing gear steels for drivetrain applications in our Memphis facility. And, I guess, maybe to help you understand a little bit about what we're doing, you need to take a look back at some of the CapEx that we've spent in the last couple of years that are specifically focused on attracting more automotive business. The number of degassers that we've installed throughout the company, the wide light project that I mentioned again today in the script, which includes a 7-stand at Berkeley. That's going to give us an opportunity with a 72-inch wide product to get into some products for the automotive that we can't currently produce without it. The Decatur automotive quality galvanizing line that we started up a few years ago, the quality of assurance line that we started up last year in Memphis. So when you look at the focus that we put in terms of our CapEx investments, you should have some level of confidence of how successful we can be moving into the automotive arena. And what also might help you, Timna, just to give you some idea of where we stand today. In 2013 in sheet, SBQ and cold finish, the products that go into automotive, about 11% of those products that we produced went into automotive today, or in 2013. One more point that I would tell you and that is this, the automotive companies like the reliability that Nucor offers them. We're extremely reliable with our 4-sheet mills. And as a result, the auto companies themselves have been actively working with our auto team to help us qualify, develop, qualify and get our steel into their automotive or into their cars.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I thought 10% or so was your historical percent exposure to auto. So maybe would it be helpful to think about how that compares with where you've been historically or the incremental amount? Or obviously I'm asking for a lot here, but margin per ton or volumes? If at some point, you're able to provide that, I know that would be something that could be really interesting.","John J. Ferriola","Well we'll take that under advisement. I'm not sure where the 10% number came from in the past. I can tell you that we've grown that significantly over the last 2 years. It is about 11% today. We expect it to grow another 4% to 5% next year, above that level. And our long-term goal, again, focusing just on the sheet SBQ and cold finish, our long-term goal would be somewhere around 15% of those products. And I'm just now getting some information from my teammates here about where the 10% number came from and that was -- it was 10% of the total steel that was supplied at that time went into automotive. The 15% is for sheet, cold finish and SBQ shipments.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you, okay. The other question I had was if you could give us some color on the comments about your second quarter, obviously, some improvement could mean a lot of things. So could you tell us what your customers are saying, particularly with regard to any pent-up demand after the particularly tough first quarter?","John J. Ferriola","Well I can tell you that our key service center customers are reporting stronger shipments, and our shipments to the end markets that we serve are also improving. Inventories at the service centers, as you know, are at historically low levels. The entire supply chain is extremely lean. And it does seem to be some catch-up going on. I noted in the earnings release this morning, the Reliance Steel release this morning, David Hannah, the Chairman and CEO, stated that both demand and pricing increased sequentially for 3 months in a row during the first quarter, a trend that we have not experienced since 2012. So we see that as a very good sign. So yes, we see some pickup. We think the second quarter will be somewhat better than the first. We tend to be a little conservative, okay? Because we don't know what's going to -- how things are going to play out. Right now, our backlogs are good across all of our product lines, our steel lines and our downstream businesses. We've seen, and particularly of note in the downstream businesses, the order entry rate and backlogs during the first quarter improved significantly. Our structural business, as I mentioned earlier, is doing well. Certainly, the -- our plate business is doing very, very well. And as we come out of the winter and go into the spring, the construction sites are going to ease up, open up. You'll see construction that has been challenged in the first quarter, because of the weather conditions, will start to move again. So we feel pretty good about the second quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","John, I just had a question on the iron ore supply chain into the DRI project. Are you, from a lead time perspective, able to get that in a month or 2? Or in the first quarter where you were costing maybe some iron ore that would have been priced, call it, mid-2013 or, call it, 3Q '13 levels, just trying to understand the supply chain there.","John J. Ferriola","Phil, we have a very regular supply chain that comes in on, basically, on a monthly basis. So it's very short -- costing tends to be very current with the current market pricing. It's a regular supply. We get a couple of sources in Brazil and a source in Canada, and we get it even from one source in Sweden, okay? So yes, as you know, that iron ore pricing is based upon a 3-month contract. That's the way it's done now. So we -- our consumption is current with a current 3-month contract. We don't have a long lead time. And because of the various locations we bring the product in from, we are not subjected to any weather issues. We don't need to buy an icebreaker.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. And then for Jim, any sort of way you could characterize the first quarter? I think you said $20 million of start-up losses in DRI. And I'm not trying to beat a dead horse here, but how much of that was related to things that were purely, maybe more mechanical versus the cost of the actual unit coming out, if there's any way to separate those 2 things? Or maybe you don't even look at it that way. I'm just trying to understand that.","James D. Frias","It wasn't really mechanical cost. There was probably some overhead cost of having some contractors and support people there that helped them during the startup. But I would say the majority was truly related to conversion costs.","John J. Ferriola","Yes, let me build on that for a minute, Jim, and say that in the last call, I used the term hiccups, and I guess I used it too much, okay? But I was very pleased to find out I'm a terrible predictor of what's to come because I got to tell you what. From equipment perspective, from an operating perspective, the startup in Louisiana was absolutely stellar. You think about the fact that there's 4.5 miles of conveyor systems supported by, if I have the number right, I believe it's something like 12,000 supporting rollers. You think about those numbers and we had very, very few shutdowns due to equipment in the first quarter. The team did a great job and the equipment performed extremely well. I just can't say how pleased we are with the equipment in the operating side. Now as Jim mentioned again, listen, we've got to focus on the process. It's a new process. And when I say it's new process, it's a new process for us. It's a larger furnace. The HYL process itself is a proven technology. It is not a new technology. But whenever you go through any startup -- I started up several milk shops in my career -- and whenever you start, going through the startup is inevitably a more significant yield loss during the startup that occurs than when you become more familiar with the process and you get all the variables under control. For example, here in Louisiana, we have several different sources of iron ore that go in. The amount of gas that's used with different types of iron ore is a factor that will affect the yield. So it's not an issue of the process or the equipment. It's an issue of becoming familiar with the different mixes and the products that are being produced and optimizing that process.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can you just remind us, and I think you mentioned it already, about how much you're physically hedged on natural gas and if there's any more wells that you have that are, call it, in development or where you expect to be at the end of this year?","John J. Ferriola","Yes. We're currently -- at the end of Q1, we're currently at 277 operating wells and we expect to be at about 316 when we wrap up the drilling program in June. So that gives you some idea of where we are. And again, in terms of production, we average just under 100,000 MMBTUs per day in Q1. And currently at our DRI facility in Louisiana, we're consuming somewhere between 75,000 and 80,000 MMBTUs per day. So that gives you some idea of the relative hedge that's in place. And as I mentioned earlier, that will change with time as we move forward, both with increasing production at Louisiana and as the wells deplete. But we're very comfortable with where we are in our hedge position, certainly for this year. And as we get closer to the end of the year and look at what happens with the curve, the future curve for gas pricing going forward, we'll examine that again at the end of the year, and make a decision on whether to resume drilling in 2015. Again, as I mentioned on our last call, the gas is not going anywhere, so it's going to stay there in the ground. If we can drill it when it's 425, that's good. If we can drill it when it's 775, that's a whole lot better. So it's not going anywhere. It's there available to us. We don't lose anything by waiting, and we have the opportunity to take it out of the ground at a higher price, as we believe gas pricing will, over time, ultimately increase, okay?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Yu with Citi.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My first question is just on exports. Could you speak to how much volume you did? And then along those lines, Jim, we do have stronger pricing in the domestic market. Is there an opportunity to try to divert some of those tons back to the domestics, given the better margins here?","John J. Ferriola","Currently, we're exporting about 8% of our total production, to answer your first question. And can you repeat the second question? I wasn't quite sure what you meant by diverting it back.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. Just that it seemed like, for many products, we have better pricing here. So I want to see if there's an opportunity to try to sell those domestically given the price improvements we've seen in the U.S. versus [indiscernible]...","John J. Ferriola","Okay. Actually, good question, and it points out a clarification I should make. When we talk about exporting 8% of our product for total production, we target on exports very high-valued steel for special applications, and so the pricing for it, even on an international basis, is very good. So the differential that you're talking about is more on the commodity grades. We don't export a lot of the commodity grades. We tend to focus on the higher-quality products, going for higher-quality, higher-valued applications overseas. So there really is not that much of a difference in pricing internationally and domestically on those products.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just I want to make sure that I've got all the moving pieces squared away on DRI because there's been a lot asked about it. Just first off, on the start-up cost, it's $20 million in the first quarter, and you're expecting $10 million to $15 million in the second quarter, so some improvement there.","James D. Frias","That's correct.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then volumes, just from my \"back of the envelope\" calculations with the 3-week shutdown, you might be looking at about 470-some-odd-thousand tons versus 455,000 in the first quarter, so maybe slightly better volumes in 2Q? And then just on the yield loss, since you're taking this downtime towards the tail end of the second quarter, any improvements on yield we're unlikely to see until 3Q?","John J. Ferriola","Well, there's -- yes, first of all, just what we're projecting in terms of production out of the DRI facility in the second quarter is probably around 500,000 tons, okay? So even though, with the 3-week outage, because of the improvements that were made in production, we will still produce about 500,000 tons. Secondly, to your question of whether we'll see the yield loss improvements or the yield improvements, only after we make the changes at the end of the month -- at the end of the quarter, excuse me, at the end of the quarter, that's partially true. But there's also another factor that comes into yield loss, and that's with the bricketer. And we're installing a bricketer, which will be up and running, okay, very, very shortly, okay? It'll be -- the bricketer will be up and running in the next 2 to 3 weeks. We expect to see a significant yield loss improvement or significant yield improvement with the start up and running of the bricketer Now we are also installing a bricketer in Trinidad, but that's not going to be ready for probably towards the end of the year. Okay?","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Martin Englert with Jefferies.","Martin Englert - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I had a quick question on the plate improvement in the volumes there. They're up pretty substantially year-on-year. I just wanted to get an idea if this is mainly market share gains or improving end user demand there.","John J. Ferriola","Well, it's a little bit of both. Okay, certainly, demand is up. But I have to tell you that the -- our ability to piggyback business given the heat treat and normalized product that we offer to the market now, we've increased significantly the breadth of product that we offer to the market. And with that, we have increased our market share, and the plate market has been strong. It's been going well. Pricing has been good, and demand has been good.","Martin Englert - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","What's been the primary driver within the demand on the consumption on their improvement?","John J. Ferriola","There's a lot of things that are doing well, shipbuilding, pod [ph] Building, railcars, bridge projects. Wind towers are still strong. I mentioned railcars, but specifically, tank cars with all of the movement of natural gas, there's a big demand for that. So all of those markets are strong. We're kind of hitting on all cylinders right now.","R. Joseph Stratman","Yes. Martin, this is Joe Stratman. I'd like to add one thing. You'll recall a couple of years ago, we set out to improve the mix we have in the plate business, expand products. So we're more able now to go after a broader range of plate products, and those plate products that are in higher demand and offer higher margins at any given point in the cycle. We have a better ability to participate in those markets than we did 2 or 3 years ago.","John J. Ferriola","And I want to make a correction here. I mentioned -- when I was talking about tank cars, I mentioned natural gas. I meant to say oil. There's been so much discussion about DRI and natural gas that I made a Freudian slip.","Martin Englert - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And one other one within the rebar fabrication business. I wanted to get an idea of the opportunity there, if you have a ballpark estimate on what kind of utilization or what type of annual capability you have within downstream rebar fab.","John J. Ferriola","You want to take a shot at that, Ray?","Raymond S. Napolitan","Well, as far as rebar -- yes, this is Ray Napolitan. As far as rebar fabrication goes, we certainly have additional utilization capabilities, in combination with our Bar Mill Group partners. And let's suffice to say we're not stretched at this point in time.","John J. Ferriola","One thing I would add though, Ray, is given the placement business that we've just acquired a short time ago and the fact that we can offer a complete solution to the customer, the rebar fabrication and placement has helped us improve our market share and our volumes.","Raymond S. Napolitan","Yes, absolutely, John, is moving up the value chain with fabrication and placing, a single-stop shop for our customers. So yes.","Martin Englert - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","How are the backlogs looking within rebar fab year-on-year?","Raymond S. Napolitan","Backlogs in rebar fab are up year-on-year and so are order entry levels.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Aldo Mazzaferro with Macquarie.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","I have 2 questions. First one, kind of a simple one, in terms of your comment about the energy costs having risen about $7 a ton, which quite a significant number, can you say how many quarters you might think it would take to revert to normal? Or is it there already?","James D. Frias","You talking about energy costs?","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","Yes.","James D. Frias","The energy costs are our market. How quickly they revert to normal will depend, I think, on weather, frankly, and how quickly natural gas supplies and storage, all those get to the point where those prices get pushed back down. But we saw increases in both natural gas costs and electricity costs at our steel mills. And that the $7 number does not include the benefit of our natural gas produced in our working interest agreement relationship. That shows up separately in our raw materials segment with the DRI business.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","Okay. So you -- did you say you it -- you think it's mostly reverting now or not yet?","James D. Frias","It has started getting better, but I don't think it's gotten back to levels we saw in the fourth quarter yet.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","Great. Okay. And then on a separate topic, your -- you got extremely strong liquidity on your balance sheet right now, including the credit line. And I see your CapEx is closer, maybe a little below depreciation levels. I'm wondering can you talk a little bit about your 3- to 5-year view as to what Nucor wants to be 3 to 5 years out in terms of size or products? Especially, what are your plans for that money?","John J. Ferriola","Nucor wants to be in 3 to 5 years as the most profitable steel and steel products company in the world. That's our -- that's always been our goal, and our intention is to achieve it. In terms of what direction we're going to go in terms of investments, it's really impossible to say. We have such a breath of products across our company that we have the potential to look at many opportunities. And so it's really a question of what opportunities become available, how they're priced, how they fit in with the long-term strategy of the company and whether it's the right move to make at that time. So we like to say we keep our powder dry. We keep a strong balance sheet so that we're ready when the right opportunity comes, and we'll take advantage of it at the right time.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Matt Murphy with UBS.","Matthew Murphy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On -- if I look across your product lines, most product lines seem to be pushing to post-recession highs. Maybe sheet stands out as a little bit of a laggard. Does that basically come down to price discipline? And I mean, you talked a little bit going forward about trying to get to some business back as customers are finding themselves short. Can you just elaborate on that a little bit more?","John J. Ferriola","Well, the sheet market has been more challenged than other markets. Rebar has also been extremely challenged. The drivers in both of those cases, frankly, is imports. Imports have had a devastating effect on rebar pricing. It has had a devastating effect on sheet pricing. In both cases, we see demand picking up a little bit, but not significantly. So -- and then touching upon your other question, going back to the challenges in the sheet market that some of our customers are experiencing and what it's done for us, as I mentioned earlier, we picked up incremental business during these supply disruptions. And conditional to the pushed-in business, we make sure that we will take the business, conditioned upon the fact that it stays on our books and awarded to Nucor throughout the rest of the calendar year. So we're taking advantage of the opportunities as they come up. But certainly, sheet has been a challenged market, along with rebar.","Matthew Murphy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And what mix of clients that you're talking to would have been former clients versus new clients on the sheet?","John J. Ferriola","Well, I don't know that I have that number. Frankly, we take care of our long-term customers. So our long-term customers who have had issues with other suppliers, who are coming to us, we are certainly taking care of them first. We don't have a lot of interest in customers who come to us only in times of needs -- need when their regular supplier has let them down because they're not as reliable as Nucor is as a supplier. So I don't have a specific number. But I would tell you that I think the additional tons that we're able to supply to people in need, most of them are going to our longer-term customers who have been loyal to us, and we're taking care of them now.","Matthew Murphy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then on your automotive business, I don't need to know, have margin comparisons between your SBQ or your initiatives in high-strength steels. But could you put in order for me kind of your rank of where you would produce material, if you had the choice, in terms of high-strength sheet, SBQ or just cold finish?","John J. Ferriola","I don't know that I would differentiate them and put them in any order of priority. They're all good businesses. And so we're focused on all 3 and we're working hard to develop new products in all 3 of those areas. So we don't put one above the other. We're focused on all 3 areas.","Matthew Murphy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And in the SBQ market, are you seeing any impact from new domestic competition?","John J. Ferriola","There's -- Jim?","James R. Darsey","Yes. Jim Darsey. Several years ago, additional SBQ capacity was announced. Nucor and other companies announced additional SBQ capacity in anticipation of the market for SBQ growing in this country. And the market continues to grow and is -- from our perspective, the SBQ producers have added capacity that has absorbed the growth in the market. It's been pretty well balanced.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'll try to keep it brief. I know it's almost 3:20. So just one quick one on DRI. I know every question has possibly been asked, but I have one more. It's carbon levels. We are you today? Where do you hope to be? And are you having to charge carbon at your EAF at the current levels if you're replacing pig iron?","John J. Ferriola","Currently, we're at about 4% carbon level. That's really a good level of carbon. We might be able to push it up another .25%, but I don't see us going much more above that. But 4% carbon on DRI is a really good quality product. To your other question of are we still in [indiscernible] ...","Ladd R. Hall","[indiscernible]","John J. Ferriola","Oh.","Ladd R. Hall","Yes. This is Ladd Hall. The more carbon you put in within the DRI, the less carbon you inject. We're still injecting some of them. I do want to make one thing clear. There's a certain point where you don't want a certain amount of carbon in that DRI. When you take -- put carbon in, you're taking metallics out. So there is a magic number in there, and we're probably around 4-plus percent of that magic number. That's where we're going to be at. We're not really striving to get a higher carbon number than that.","John J. Ferriola","Okay, thanks Ladd.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got you. And just one last one. On the auto sheet front, do you have any plans of building a continuous annealing line and get into Gen 3 products?","John J. Ferriola","Well. we're always taking a look at new opportunities, so I'm not going to say no. But at this point, it's not high on our list of things to do. But we are studying it. We've taken a look at the market, and we're going to see whether or not that's something we need to move forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","John, I have a question on the sheet market. How much capacity do you have freed up that you can take share from some of your competitors right now?","John J. Ferriola","Well, let's see. Probably, we're operating somewhere in the neighborhood of 80% to 85% capacity utilization. So we would have a small amount that we could continue to take. Now of course, that's where we are today. Well, we did have quite an influx of orders over the last couple of weeks. So we're in the process of processing those orders. So I would say that we're getting close to the point where we would not be able to take any more business. But at the right price, you can always work in a few tons. So if there's a customer listening to the call that needs some steel in a hurry, give us a call.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And where -- how far out are you booked right now on sheet?","John J. Ferriola","We're up to the end of June.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And what's the pricing for at the end of June right now on hot rolled?","John J. Ferriola","I'm not going to give any specific price, but we're in the neighborhood of about $680 to $700.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Lane with Morningstar.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Really, just one question for me. Now that your mills are using increasing volumes of DRI produced in-house, how have your scrap purchasing practices changed, if at all? You discussed the batch-to-batch flexibility that DRI application allows for when selecting quantities of various feedstocks. But have you already begun to change your actual usage mix of obsolete scrap relative to higher-quality scrap as you apply incremental DRI to your melts?","John J. Ferriola","Absolutely. As I mentioned earlier, we've been able to achieve mixes of up to 30% to 40% of DRI. And when you get to that level, it allows you to put much more obsolete scrap into the furnace. So we are adjusting our mixes on a regular basis. We're taking a look, as I mentioned earlier, on pricing of all of the various commodities, and we're making adjustments as to optimize the mix cost.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And was that -- are you...","John J. Ferriola","[indiscernible] right now.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes. And was that 30% to 40% kind of a target level that you're -- you have achieved and you're happy with? Or is that going to be pushed higher in the coming quarters?","John J. Ferriola","We'll work to move it a little bit higher. But I have to tell you, we're pretty high -- we're pretty happy with that percentage. You go back just a couple of years when we've had the quality of the DRI nowhere close to where it is today. We had about -- facility in Trinidad, as well as the 1 in Louisiana, we were in the neighborhood of only being able to achieve 8% to 10% of the total raw material input. Today, we're at 30% to 40%. We pushed it on an experimental basis. At 1 of our facilities, we were over 50%. I'll leave it at that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sal Tharani.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You have a -- you mentioned a spreadsheet you have on your website, which is very helpful in terms of calculating the cost of DRI. I was wondering how should we think about the iron ore cost? Is it -- do you have a lag? I mean, do you buy a 3-month lag or 4-month lag? Some companies in the U.S. have that kind of formula. I just was wondering, when we use iron ore price, what should we use in the calculation? Because iron ore price changes almost everyday.","John J. Ferriola","Well, mostly iron ore is sold on a quarterly contract price basis, okay? So when you want to look at what you would put into the formula, you would look at the last quarter's contract price, okay? So it's really a 3-month lagging number. If you want to look at it and currently, it would be in the December, January, February, March levels.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And one more thing on the -- you had -- you are one of the companies who had walked away from the CRU-minus contracts, which I would -- I think is a very good strategy. I was just wondering if anything you can share in terms of what you learned or any regrets, anything you missed out or you think that it was -- it worked very well as you had expected?","John J. Ferriola","Well, it's proven to be a good decision, without a doubt, particularly with our ability to take advantage of the spot market improvement over the last couple of weeks. We've been able to manage our sheet order book to a more effective balance between contracts and real spot market pricing. So overall, we're very pleased with -- we believe it was a good decision. We're pleased with the outcome.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ferriola, I would like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","John J. Ferriola","Thank you, and let me conclude by saying thank you to our shareholders. We certainly appreciate your confidence and your support. Thank you to our customers. We appreciate your business. I want to say thank you to my Nucor teammates for creating value for our customers, generating attractive returns for our shareholders and building a sustainable future for all of us. And most importantly, like always, thank you for doing it safely. Thanks to you all for your interest in Nucor. Have a great day.","Operator","This now concludes the presentation.

Please go ahead, sir.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon. This is John Ferriola, Nucor's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor.","With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team: Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey, Keith Grass, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman and Chad Utermark.","In May, we announced the promotion of Chad to Executive Vice President of Beam and Plate Products. Joe Stratman, who has served in that role since 2007, will focus on our business development activities, for which he assumed responsibility in 2010. These moves result from ongoing implementation of Nucor's thoughtful and orderly succession planning.","Chad Utermark is a 22-year veteran of our company, and will be a strong addition to our executive management team. He is a proven Nucor leader with experience in our sheet, bar and structural steel mill operations. Since 2011, he has served as General Manager of Nucor-Yamato Steel. Chad and his team are well-prepared to continue Nucor's highly successful record of profitable growth in Beam and Plate Products.","On behalf of the entire executive management team, I want to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for a job extremely well done in the second quarter. You worked hard and work together to deliver better than expected earnings.","Nucor's second quarter earnings increased over both this year's first quarter and the year-ago quarter. This growth was achieved, despite a very serious challenge of surging imports in many of our products produced by our steel mills.","It should also be noted that while non-residential construction is improving, it is improving from a very low base. The key driver to Nucor's performance in this quarter's still very challenging environment is easy to identify. Our more than 22,000 teammates are doing an outstanding job on the execution of Nucor's strategy for profitable growth.","During the current downturn, we have invested significant capital in a large number of projects to improve our cost structure and expand our product portfolios to include more value-added higher margins offerings. We are now just beginning to see some of the benefit from these strategic investments. We expect the returns will grow dramatically in the years ahead, as steel markets and non-residential construction inevitably improve.","I want to again thank all of our Nucor teammates for their unrivaled commitment to excellence and taking care of all of our customers each and every day. Nucor's employees, the right people, are our company's greatest asset and our greatest competitive advantage. Keep up the great work that you're doing. Most importantly please stay focused on our number priority, working safely.","I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to review Nucor's second quarter performance and financial position. Following Jim's comments, I will update you on strategic issues and our progress implementing our plan for long-term profitable growth. Jim?","James Frias","Thanks, John. Good afternoon to everyone. Second quarter 2014 earnings of $0.46 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.35 to $0.40 per diluted share. For the month of June, results from our steel mills and steel product segment were much better than forecast. As expected, the performance of our raw material segment included an operating loss of approximately $0.06 per diluted share at our new direct reduced iron, or DRI, facility in Louisiana.","Second quarter of 2014 earnings improved over first quarter of 2014 earnings of $0.35 per diluted share, even after adjusting for period specific items. The first quarter of 2014, included $0.06 per share for diluted share of unusual expenses and a charge of $0.03 per diluted share for LIFO inventory valuation.","The second quarter of 2014, included no LIFO inventory valuation charge and carried approximately $0.04 per diluted share of higher stock-based compensation expense related to the timing of annual grants. These grants are typically authorized in June of each year.","The second quarter of 2013 carried a comparable amount of stock-based compensation expense. Nucor's year-over-year improvement in earnings was very robust compared to second quarter of 2013 earnings of $0.27 per diluted share. Last year's second quarter included no LIFO inventory activity and no unusual items.","As John mentioned, our teams working throughout Nucor are working hard to increase earnings, despite continued headwinds from surging imports and a non-residential construction market that remains less than 60% of the peak from 2007. Our teammates' success is demonstrated by a 52% gain in the first half of 2014 in earnings over the year-ago period.","Noteworthy contributors to the improved year-to-date earnings include our sheet mills, plate mills and fabricated construction products. Our sheet mills capitalized on both improved demand and opportunities provided by supply disruption at our competitors. Our plate mill group is benefiting from the investments made during the downturn at our North Carolina plate mill to add a heat treat facility, a vacuum tank degasser and a normalizing line.","Our fabricated construction products group has taken advantage of small, but noticeable improvements in non-residential construction activity, by both growing our market share and increasing our margins in rebar fabrication, joist and decking, and pre-engineered metal buildings.","A comment about our tax rates, as it can be confusing, due to the impact of profits from non-controlling interest. After adjusting out profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was 33.8% for the second quarter of 2014. That is consistent with our expectations for full year effective tax rate of approximately 34%. After adjusting out profits belonging to our business partners and the first quarter charge related primarily to New York State, tax law changes.","At the end of the second quarter, Nucor's financial position remained strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 35.8%. Our cash and short-term investments totaled $1.2 billion. Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn, and does not mature until August of 2018. We have no commercial paper outstanding.","Our next significant debt maturity is not until 2017. Nucor is the only steel producer in North America to enjoy the important competitive advantage of an investment-grade credit rating.","Our financial strength is a significant competitive advantage. It allows us to invest aggressively during downturns to grow our long-term earnings power, which is a long tradition of Nucor. During the current downturn, Nucor has invested in a broad range of strategic investments throughout our steel making, raw materials and downstream businesses.","Our investments all build upon Nucor's competitive advantages that include our low cost and highly flexible production capabilities, our diversified product mix and our market leadership positions. With these investments, Nucor is extremely well-positioned to continue our industry-leading through-the-cycle return on capital performance. Our focus remains on being an effective steward of our shareholders valuable capital.","We continue to estimate our 2014 capital spending will be approximately $600 million. That would be a significant decline from capital expenditures that exceeded $1 billion in both 2013 and 2012. Most of our recent growth projects have been completed or are nearing completion. Also, the current temporary suspension of drilling new wells by our natural gas working interest investment reduces Nucor's 2014 capital spending by about $400 million.","For the third quarter of 2014, Nucor's earnings are expected to show strong improvement over second quarter earnings. We expect increased profits at our structural, plate and sheet mills. Profitability of our bar mills should be stable compared with second quarter's performance. Our fabricated construction products businesses are expected to increase their earnings as non-residential construction activity continues its slow, steady, recovery.","In the second quarter, our Louisiana DRI facility completed its planned three-week outage to make equipment adjustments. We expect marked improvement in the performance of this plant in the third quarter and profitability achieved by yearend.","The biggest risk to the outlook for our industry continues to be excess global steel capacity and the ongoing threat of steel illegally dumped into the United States. Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance in the final month of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in our company. John?","John Ferriola","Thank you, Jim. I would like to share some thoughts regarding the major industry risk that Jim identified, imports. In 2014, we are experiencing in the United States market what can best be described as a Tsunami of imported steel. Given the indisputable fact that mills in the United States are among the lowest cost producers of steel in the world, this makes no sound economic sense.","A significant portion of this import surge is being driven by worldwide overcapacity that continues to operate as a result of illegal government subsidies and other trade law violations. The Nucor teams work to build sustainable long-term profitability requires that we fight hard to encourage our government to enforce our nation's credit loss.","These trade remedies are not protectionism. The World Trade Organization or WTO established these actions as appropriate and necessary responses to subsidized exports and dumping practices of nations with access capacity.","Several current trade case filings underway are of critical importance to Nucor and U.S. manufacturing jobs. These include rebar, pipes and tube products and wire rod. We were pleased by the Commerce Department's recent final decision to assess anti-dumping duties on oil country tubular goods imported from Korea, following a core preliminary finding.","Domestic producers of OCTG products are significant and highly value customers of Nucor. Regarding the Commerce Department's preliminary determinations in the rebar case, we were encouraged by the findings on Mexican imports. While the findings on Turkish imports were disappointing, we are advancing small arguments for the Commerce Department to consider as it prepared as final determinations scheduled for release in September.","During the second quarter, our team stayed focused on what is under our control today. I am very encouraged by our performance in the second quarter and the first half of 2014. Nucor delivered solid earnings growth in what are still very challenging steel market conditions.","First and foremost, each day we pursue continual improvement in the job we are doing taking care of our customers. At the same time, our team has made excellent progress implementing our strategy of investing for long-term profitable growth.","Here are some notable achievements during the second quarter. In June, our Nucor-Yamato structural mill completed an approximately $115 million project to expand its sheet piling production capabilities. Trials of the new products are underway this quarter with prime production expected early in the fourth quarter.","The new piling sections will increase single sheet widths by 22% and provide a lighter stronger piling covering more area at a lower installed cost. This investment strengthens our market position in the piling business. It also allows us to realize more synergies from our already successful 2012 acquisition of piling distributor Skyline Steel.","In late June, our new Louisiana DRI facility completed a planned three-week outage to implement equipment adjustments that will improve yields and conversion cost. Our team has already achieved outstanding quality and productivity in the first six months of operations. In fact, Louisiana has set new world-class quality standards with metallization rates up 96% and carbon content exceeding 4%.","It's not surprising that our flat rolls and SBQ steel mills are eager to consume as much of Louisiana's output as they can get it. With the equipment adjustments completed, we expect significant reductions in yield loss in conversion costs during the second half of this year. As Jim mentioned, we also anticipate profitable performance by the end of this year.","Our successful startup of the Louisiana DRI plant is a major step forward in the implementation of our raw materials strategy. We view our expanded DRI capacity combined with our natural gas investments to be a game changer for Nucor's ability to grow in the higher value-added sheet, plate in SBQ markets.","The benefits from our raw material strategy are many. It significantly improves our long-term cost structure, with a high quality iron units we need to compete in the targeted products. It lowers the operating costs of our mills, through reduced usage of consumables and energy, as well as increased productivity.","It enhances our ability to optimize our mix of iron units based on variations and the market pricing of those raw materials. It gives us greater commercial flexibility in working with our contract customers. It reduces the geopolitical risk exposure of our supply chain, given that many of today's merchant pig iron and DRI producers are located in country such as Russia, Ukraine and Venezuela.","Finally and very importantly, it protects us from the long-term degradation of prime supplies that result from the growing market share of recycles field. All of these benefits make clear why implementation of our raw material strategy has been so important to the Nucor team.","Nucor's Bar Mill Group made excellent progress during the first half of 2014 expanding its penetration of SBQ and rod markets. Our South Carolina bar mill increased production at its new rod mill. Customer feedback has been very favorable, as our Darlington team broadens its product range to include the more demanding, high carbon, wire rod off puts.","Nucor Steel Memphis is taking advantage of recently commissioned offline inspection equipment to begin production qualification trials with automotive OEMs. Memphis also completed installation of a fourth caster strainer that will support our growth serving customers in the energy markets.","Nucor Steel Nebraska has recently installed quality inspection line is already at full capacity and plans are being made to add a second line in 2015. Nebraska is also installing a fifth caster strainer to take advantage of growing demand from it's customers for high quality SBQ brands and seamless tube round billers.","Nucor Steel Berkeley's successful start-up this year of its wide light capital project is building momentum with a growing order book. The new wider and lighter products already account for 5% of Berkeley's order book. The investment provides Berkeley with the capability to roll gauges and spinners 0.042 inches, which is the lightest hot roll gauge capability of any sheet mill in the Southern U.S. market.","Berkeley's capabilities also provide a finished width of up to 72 inches. We estimate the size of this new market segment, now available to Berkeley to be approximately 4 million tons of annual volume. Our expanded product portfolio is allowing us to move up the value change in agricultural, automotive, heavy equipments and pipe and tube applications.","During the second quarter, our David J. Joseph scrap business acquired two shredders and related assets, one in Tampa, Florida and the other in Salt Lake City, Utah. These purchases are consistent with DJJ's disciplined growth strategy to expand its existing, regional recycling platforms when the marketplace provides us with attractive opportunities.","These significant and numerous investments we have been making over the past several years are all within the framework of our well-defined strategic growth plan. The goals of our growth plan are to increase our returns to shareholders by increasing our tons produced, increasing our profits per ton, and adding resiliency to our business against the impact for global steel making overcapacity.","We are succeeding at accomplishing these goals. As has been true throughout Nucor's history, our company's best years are still ahead of us.","Thank you for your interest in Nucor and sharing a valuable time with us this afternoon. We would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Luke Folta with Jefferies ","Luke Folta - Jefferies","First question I had was on share. Clearly, you gained some share on the flat rolled side of the business, and also wanted to talk on structural. On flat rolled, I remember some commentary around the idea that if you were going to pick up share from some of the integrated players, given the production outages in the first half, that you would hope to do so by also getting some full year business, implying that you wouldn't sell otherwise.","And then also on the structural side of the market, looking at one of your competitors who reported this week, it looks like in aggregate so far from who is from the companies that have reported, we've seen a pretty healthy pickup in demand in that market. How much I guess market share do you think or I guess how big of an impact did you think the outage that you had at Yamato was, in terms of your shipment trends this quarter? And do you get most of that back heading into next quarter?","John Ferriola","Well, certainly had a major impact. It was a three-week outage. Our kudos to the team at Nucor-Yamato, they completed the task within the three-weeks. They did a great job. It was a result of quite a bit of advanced planning and advanced work. They came out of the startup extremely well. They're running well.","They're going through the trials now with all of the different shapes going through the new equipment. And I'm really pleased with the progress that they are making. It's going much quicker than we thought. And we are confident that we will regain those tons in the second part of this year.","Well, I was going to go to your first question, actually. You had a comment about our sheet business, and whether or not our approach, we certainly didn't say we wouldn't sell to anybody, but we did say that we would give preferential treatment to those customers who were in a bind because of the situations with some of our competitors.","We would give preference to those who were able to give us business that was not just a short-term business, but it was there for the rest of the year. And frankly, we probably lost a little bit of short-term spot business, as a result of that. But in return, we were able to gain longer-term market share improvements and we're confident that what we gain we'll be able to hold through the rest of the year.","James Frias","Luke, I'm sorry, one other thing I'd like to add is, as you think about our quarter-over-quarter performance, I remember that the first quarter was four days longer for us, the way we do our calendar cut-off than the second quarter.","John Ferriola","And I'd also say that in first quarter we were not impacted by the weather conditions as much as some of our competitors. Our teams, particularly, Crawfordsville, God bless them, I don't know how they did it, but they were able to ship well during some of those polar vortexes, I guess, is what they are called now. But the team did a great job and we were able to maintain shipments through the first quarter. So unlike some of our competitors, we did not have to make up those tons in the second quarter.","Luke Folta - Jefferies","And just if I could, on Severstal Columbus, obviously the announced acquisition this week by Steel Dynamics, I guess looking at it, I wanted to understand, is this something that you took a look at? It looks like the valuation seems pretty reasonable. It looks like a fairly accretive deal for them. I would have thought for Nucor, the synergies would be at least as good, if not better, just given the DRI plant located there and just the regional presence. Curious to know what your interest level was or if you participated in that at all and just your thought process on it?","John Ferriola","Well, I'm going to have to answer the question in a hypothetical mode, because I cannot say whether or not we actually participated in the process. But if we had been involved in the process, these are some of the thoughts that we would have about the valuation and really what it meant to Nucor.","Let me start by saying that Severstal is a good asset. And it's good equipment. It's good quality. But given this location, it was not a particularly good fit for our well-disciplined growth strategy in our vision. And therefore, we couldn't justify paying such a high price for that asset. Again, hypothetically speaking, if we were involved in the process. But I got to say, Luke, that given that it was not right for us, we were pleased that it ended up with an existing domestic competitor, which resulted in further consolidation in sheet industry.","This consolidation, when you think about it and you couple it with the TK also a middle consolidation, and the fact that RG is permanently out of the market, means that we've had three major consolidating movements in the sheet market over the last two years. Obviously, this is going to result in a stronger, more competitive sheet industry. Nucor being, given our extremely significant or strong position in sheet, will continue to benefit and try in this new environment. And we get to enjoy the benefit of that better market without having to have spent $1.6 billion to get it.","I want to make one more point, just in general, about our strategy and some of our history in the past. In the past, Nucor has been aggressive in growing through acquisition. And we will continue to be aggressive in growing though acquisition in the future, when the target is a good fit for our well-defined strategic plan.","You mentioned the fact that we have a strong presence, so you thought that that would provide some synergies for us. Well, we look at it a little bit differently, as we were valuing this potential target and we thought about what we were going to do in the process. Now, Luke, you got to think about the fact that we already have an extremely strong position in the Southeast, with three mills and 9 million tons of capacity.","And when we place value, when we go about placing value of potential target, we consider many factors, but three are the really key factors that we consider are: whether that target, that asset, will increase our geographical inch; whether it would expand our customer base; whether it would expand our product portfolio. In the case of Severstal, it did not accomplish any of those objects.","We're well-positioned in the Southeast. We have three mills and 9 million tons of capacity in Southeast. In fact, we have one mill, Luke, we have one mill within a 150 miles of Severstal. We have a second mill within 250 miles of Severstal. So clearly Severstal did not increase our geographical reach. When we looked at customers, well, we already touch every customer that Severstal touches, and frankly some of that they don't touch. So it would not have expanded our customer base at all.","We can already produce virtually every product that Severstal can make. So it didn't expand our product portfolio. In fact, with the successful completion of our wide light project at Berkeley that I mentioned during the call, we'll be able to offer the market a lighter gauge hot band than Severstal can produce.","So given that it really didn't expand our geographical footprint, it didn't help us on our customer base, it didn't expand our product portfolio. We could not just apply the $1.6 billion price tag. It simply didn't bring $1.6 billion of value to Nucor. I covered a lot of information on that deal, so I'm hoping we focus the rest of the call on Nucor and not just one particular deal.","Go ahead, next question.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Matt Murphy with UBS.","Matt Murphy - UBS","Maybe now one specifically on Nucor, but more on the industry, where you comment imports have surpassed 2006 levels. I guess I am just wondering what your thinking is on future trade cases, what the hold up is? Is it in sort of information collection time, if you could just expand on that a little?","John Ferriola","Well, there is a couple of points to be made there. I think, number one, my general impression is that as I spend time in Washington, I'm a little bit more optimistic that our government is finally to getting to understand some of the importance of these trade cases and the impact that it has on our economy, on our employment situation, particularly in the manufacturing area.","So I'm getting a little bit more confident that our government, the Commerce Department, the ITC, is better understanding the impact that not only the imports have on our economy, but also a better understanding of the process and the length of time it takes and the damage that's done as a result of that length of time.","And as a result, we continue our hard work in Washington. As a result, as I mentioned, there is a long process. U.S. was holding up some potential trade cases coming down the road, well, it's the process. We are gathering information. I'm not going to give anything more specific about what trade cases might be coming down the pipe. I don't think you have to use too much of your imagination to figure out what it is.","We've been pleased with the outcome at the OCTG case. We feel good about the rebar case with. One of the things that I mentioned in script was that, we're working with the Commerce Department to help them better understand facts of the case. And given that, we feel confident that we've got a good shot at a final ruling that's more favorable than the preliminary. So overall, listen, overcapacity in the world is a major issue.","It is one of our greatest risk, not only to Nucor, but to our entire industry. Nucor will, as we always have, been very local and we will continue to fight a good fight. And we're confident we're going to be more and more successful going forward, because more and more of our trade laws are being flagrantly violated. So as a result, I'm pretty optimistic about the future, but I'm not going to give any specific sense to what cases might be coming down the pipeline.","Matt Murphy - UBS","And then maybe just one specific on structural. Second quarter realized pricing was pretty strong. How sustainable do you think that is in the second half?","John Ferriola","Our backlogs are good. The market is good. Demand is good. We're going to be bringing new products on to the market. Given all of that, we feel it's sustainable through the second half of the year. It's hard to look out much past the second half of the year, so I'm not going to make any comments about 2015. But certainly, we feel good about it, and particularly given the new products that we're going to be able to offer off of that mill. We're excited about it. We really are. And the market is very excited about them also.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just wanted to ask a little bit more generally speaking about uses of cash. And I think that you make the point that you're not investing in gas exploration. You made the point that you have very strong free cash flows, great balance sheet. And as such, I think it begs the question or revisits the question of, what you're planning to do with the capital.","So I want to ask again, now that we've seen the DRI plant start to work a little bit more in your favor, you're getting a little bit more comfortable with it, and now that you have seen some M&A unlocked, not just the one that was announced earlier this week, but other opportunities that are starting to portray themselves in the market. How do you think about build versus buy? How do you think about the options out in the market? You do have a very strong balance sheet, interest rates are low. Can you just give us a flavor about what you're thinking about and what priorities?","John Ferriola","Well, as a general statement, I would say that we're still probably leaning towards buy rather than build, simply because the older capacity that already exists in the world, we don't see any sense in adding to it. Certainly, in the United States market, we've had a fairly good balance at this point, and we wouldn't consider building a new sheet mill, or I feel there might be other products that we would look at, we think that there are some areas where we have potential to grow.","A more general answer, Timna, is listen, the world is our oyster. We've got a great balance sheet. We're wrapping up a lot of projects. I think there's a total of 12 projects we've done over the last four years that are starting to come, that has come to conclusion, and is starting to show some returns, so we're feeling better about those. We'll be wrapping up the few remaining ones in the next six months, 12 months. So we're in a position where we will again becoming rather aggressive in growing the company in some possibly new directions.","I would also tell you that there are some opportunities out there that fit much better than in Severstal asset fit. Better location relative to our mills, areas where we do not have a strong of a presence and we don't have as high of a percent of market share as we do in the Southeast. And overall, the Southeast, we've got something like kind of 25%, 30% market share.","And there's other regions of the country where there is actually more market demand in sheet products where we have a much smaller footprint and a smaller market share. So there is a lot of opportunities out there. On the structural side, we've just completed this new project to get new products out there. Now, we've got to take that to the market. We're excited about some opportunities we can do.","And one of the things that we did in addition to the new piling sections that we have is we -- let me see how I can say this, we improved the quality of the products that we are putting through the mill already and with much greater tolerances than have been available in the past. I'll leave it at that.","And our customers are very excited about that. Not only do we feel that that will bring some additional business or bring us some additional margin. We feel good about that.","So right now, Timna, I'm glad that we had a strong balance sheet, I really am. It speaks once again to Nucor's successful longstanding policy of maintaining a strong balance sheet and then taking advantage of that to grow the company in many ways, organically, incrementally and in larger ways through acquisitions.","Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","If I can follow up. Now that does, except for that you didn't mention DRI once. So I guess I can follow-up there and ask about that, in light of the cancellation of one project that was being contemplated, but pig iron prices staying stubbornly high, how are you looking at DRI now?","John Ferriola","You mean someone else canceling a DRI project, whether that impacts the way that we think about DRI.","Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just an update, in light of the fact that, A, someone canceled a project; B, pig iron prices have stayed high; and I guess C, you're also seeing your own project come closer to the levels that you'd aimed for. So how do you think about all those in light of your own DRI plans?","John Ferriola","Certainly all of those are favorable factors supporting the initial decision to go into DRI. You could argue that the one other company canceling the project might indicate that they felt that it wasn't a good project. DRI wasn't a good way to go in terms of a raw material supply. But I would caution you that you must remember that it isn't, unless you have a gas contract to along with it.","Okay. We do, they didn't. I don't blame them. Okay, I'll leave it at that. Certainly, the fact that we've gained some confidence out of the DRI Louisiana plant that we're currently running in terms of the quality that client put out. We are still working through some of our startup issues, no doubt about that. We shut down for three weeks.","We made some modifications from information, knowledge that we gained by running. They're in the first period. And I have to say that we're pleased with the results of the equipment modifications that we made during that three-week outage. We still have more work to do, but what we've seen as we came out of that outage. There was great confidence in the long-term success for that plant.","So all of that factors into. Certainly ,we're still considering the second DRI plant. I have said many times and I'll say again that we want to get first one up and running and learn all we can from it, so that if we want to make any tweaks, either to the equipment or however, whatever changes we might want to make in the system, we don't want to build the second one until we fully gain all the knowledge we can get out of the first one.","We learned a lot in first six months. We'll learn more in the six months. But I will tell you, and this is a good long-term strategy for Nucor, okay. I gave you the reasons, and that the key word that I hope you caught there was, this is a good long-term strategy.","This is more than just a short-term boost to earnings, okay. This is something that we believe in five, 10, 15 years from today is going to truly differentiate Nucor from our competitors. And I gave you the list of reasons why I felt that way.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.","Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs","My first question for Jim. You have taken your LIFO, cut your LIFO by half for the year. Just wondering, is it your reflection of steel prices or is it the iron ore price? What's driving that?","James Frias","The biggest driver, Sal, is scrap pricing.","Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs","So you think scrap is going to follow iron ore over the period of the next six months?","James Frias","Yes. We think it's going to be relatively flat. It certainly hasn't trended up to where it would have needed to go to justify what was our original budget for LIFO expense.","Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs","John, the Steel Dynamics had made some positive commentary in non-res construction in terms of joist orders and so forth. I was just wondering, and you have mentioned about your downstream business are getting better than you expect, further improvement in third quarter. How quick is this transition going on? Do you think this is going to be a pretty strong recovery over the next year-and-a-half or so or is it going to limp along, 4%, 5% type of recovery from a very low base?","John Ferriola","I believe and we believe that it will limp along at a very slow recovery, 5% to 6%. I think what might be misleading some people is the rate of increase in second quarter versus first quarter. And I think you have to be careful about that. First quarter was very heavily impacted by weather in every one of our downstream businesses, and I suspect in everyone else's downstream business.","If we look at just our second quarter order entry rate in downstream businesses relative to first quarter, we see a very significant improvement. But some of that, as I said, is a result of catching up from the first quarter's poor weather conditions that really hampered by any kind of non-residential construction.","So as we go forward to the rest of the year, we think that there will be continuous improvement, most analyst and we particularly agree with them, saying that by the end of the year, the 2014 versus '13 increase will be somewhere around that 5% to 6% number. And we believe that's accurate.","Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs","The next question is on the DRI. And I understand your comment that it's doing better than what you have thought. So your initial assessment was that it would take a year to make it profitable?","John Ferriola","Yes. I think we are still saying that we will be profitable by the end of the year.","James Frias","Yes. I'm not saying that we're going to making up at the end of the year to cover the losses in the first half. We are just saying that the fourth quarter's operations will be generating profits by our current estimation.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Nathan Littlewood with Credit Suisse.","Nathan Littlewood - Credit Suisse","Listen, just wanted to ask a little bit about imports and the OCT trade case. So I guess traditional thinking, up until we saw this one recently, was that there generally wasn't a huge amount of change in terms of the duties or tariffs supplied between the preliminary and final determinations.","But what we're seeing here is an example where they have changed quite significantly. I was interested in hearing your thoughts on a couple of things. Firstly, number one, how has the OCTG example sort of changed the way you think about trade cases? How you approach trade cases? And the second part is could you talk a little bit about the number of people and the resources that you allocate to trade case investigations? And are you in any way thinking about increasing that, given the success that we've seen with OCTG?","John Ferriola","Let me tackle the first question first. The OCTG case has impacted the way that we view trade cases going forward. One of the things that we believe led to the success here was the fact that we worked very hard with the ITC and with Congress to help them understand the data and look at how that data was being presented by some of the countries in the case.","We believed, and apparently obviously we were able to convince them, that the way the data was being presented was very misleading. Helping them walk through that process resulted in a more positive outcome for us and for the industry.","How does that impact us going forward? Well, certainly now having learned that, we will present the data in a way that for us makes it some very clear and work with the Commerce and ITC to help them understand the way that the data from the offending countries is presented.","So we've learned from the lesson. And how do I feel about things going forward, as I mentioned earlier, it's impossible to say with any level of certainty, but you have a certain sense of feelings when you are in Washington. And my sense is that I feel more optimistic about the cases coming up as we go forward.","I think both Commerce and the ITC are seeing the -- what we've been saying for quite some time, the practice of repeat offenders, the practice of product substitution, you win a case on one thing, they immediately win it on structural beams, they got to rebar, you win it on rebar, they go to merchant bar.","Now, there's a pattern that's being developed that we're helping the ITC and Commerce Department understand, which points to some very basic flaws in the way our laws are being applied. And we're working hard to help Washington and the proper authorities understand that.","And your second question was whether or not we felt a need to increase the size of our team working in Washington. All I can tell you, it's a very small team, but it's extremely effective team. We've got the best there is. And I don't think we need to grow it at all. The team has got a great deal of confidence. They had shown what they can accomplish. And they have been very successful and I don't see us changing that at all.","Nathan Littlewood - Credit Suisse","I just had one final one on back on DRI and the DRI economics. Over the past few months, as Timna, was asking earlier, we've seen pig iron prices hold up remarkably well. The headline finds prices come down, iron ore pellet premiums have come down as well, so one would have to assume that the margin or the raw material spread has gotten a heck of a lot better for you guys over the last couple of months.","Could you talk a little about that sort of spread or some of the underlying commodity price assumptions upon which your profitability guidance is based? And as you know, that spread can kind of vary by $100 a ton or more over the course of a few months. So what sort of commodity price environment do you achieve breakeven? And if we saw the current spreads maintained, is there risk profitability may actually be a little bit earlier?","John Ferriola","Well, there is always that possibility. In terms of what are the margins given different pricing of the commodity that we used to make this determination, we have a nice spreadsheet that's up on our website and it's a very interactive spreadsheet, very easy to work with, you plug-in whatever numbers you want to plug into with iron and pallet premiums and every other element that goes into it. And it will spread out the differential. So I'm not going to go through the different scenarios. There's just too many of them to consider. But I would point you to that spreadsheet and recommend that if you want to work with those numbers, you will clearly use that spreadsheet and you will get that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Aldo Mazzaferro with Macquarie.","Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie","On the DRI, you said there was a 96% metalization and a 4% carbon. That sounds like a pretty good mix there. I'm wondering, when you say -- ","John Ferriola","Well, let me stop you right there, okay. Let me stop you right there for a minute, Aldo. It's not a very good mix. It's a great mix, it's an outstanding, it's world-class setting mix. Now, you can continue.","Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie","So my question is when you say you want to improve the yield, are you talking about the metalization yield or are you talking about a yield to finished product from pellet?","John Ferriola","Processed yield. In other words, yield to finished product. Process yield, not the metalization or the carbon rates.","Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie","Can you say what that yield is now and what your target would be?","John Ferriola","It's not as good as wanted to be. It's a hell of a lot better than when we started. That's the parameters that I'll give you. We made some progress after a few weeks of running. We've recognized some issues that we had to go in and take care of, which we did during three week outage that we mentioned few times. Coming out of that, we saw our yield improve still more. We will continue to work to get it even better by the end of the year. Frankly, I'm hoping our team is listening there, and when I say that our goal, okay, is 99.999% yields.","Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie","So right now, you only have two 9's probably, right? So the other question I had, John, is on the shredder acquisition you made. Can you give us an idea of what the volume potential would be of those two things?","John Ferriola","I'm going to turn that over to our scrap guru over here, Keith.","Keith Grass","Scrap guru, I'm not sure, but between the two of them, it adds an additional quarter million tons of shredding volumes through the facilities. And maybe just one extra point that there was an effort of consolidation. So we operate facilities in both of those regions and are in the process of, and in fact in both cases have already consolidated into our existing shredding platform.","John Ferriola","And that's the key point. You made an additional point, but it's really it's a key point of the disciplined structured growth plan at DJ Joseph of building on existing platforms that we have in place, which brings some synergies to it and got a good management team in place. So the growth you're going to see at DJ Joseph going forward will be similar to this, where we grow incrementally at each one of our platforms taking advantage of comp consolidation and the synergies.","Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie","And can you just say how much of all the scrap that Joseph handles, I know they do a lot of brokerage and then they also do some shredding, can you say how much they shred versus broker, roughly?","John Ferriola","We've shred, what, about 4.5 million tons, but close to the 3.5 million tons. So we shred 3.5 million tons and we broke quite a bit more than that, between 20 million or 24 million tons we broke.","Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie","And you got time for one more question, on the acquisition front.","John Ferriola","Absolutely.","Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie","John, I am very interested in your landscape comments on the industry about where you might see opportunities for acquisitions. And I had the feeling you were talking about the upper Midwest as an opportunity. But they're very big unionized mills up there. I know there's a small one for sale in Kentucky. I'm wondering, the small one for sale in Kentucky, I could see it, but not really a needle mover. But in terms of a big mill in the Midwest, is that something you would consider?","John Ferriola","We don't discuss our strategic plan. We've got competitors onshore listening to this call, would love to learn what it is we plan to do going forward. So I'm not going to make any comments at all. Other than we always say, no comment, when it comes to strategic planning and merger and acquisition opportunities.","Operator","And we'll take our last question in the queue from Brian Yu with Citi.","Brian Yu - Citi","A question on the DRI, I think in the last quarter you guys said you would do about 200,000 tons or 500,000 tons in the second quarter. Would you be able to provide some targets of what you guys are hoping to accomplish maybe 3Q and 4Q, as part of this breakthrough to profitability?","John Ferriola","I just want to make sure I understand the question. You're asking, how many tons we think we'll produce at DRI during the third and fourth quarter?","Brian Yu - Citi","Yes. That's right.","John Ferriola","We think we'll be somewhere, and again, we're in a ramp up mode, so I'm going to give you a range here, because as I said, we are in this ramp up mode. It's somewhere between 700,000 tons and 900,000 tons.","James Frias","For the second half of the year?","John Ferriola","For the second half of the year.","Brian Yu - Citi","And are there any other outages that's planned for that facility or is it at this point more of getting the process locked down, and as you mentioned earlier, improving those process yields?","John Ferriola","We are and that's exactly what's taking place right now. It's getting the process locked down. As you go through that, you might see different things that you want to make some changes to or improvements with. You might shutdown to do that. But we aren't anticipating any major shutdowns between now and the end of the year.","That's the end of the questions. Well, I'm assuming there are no further questions, and I am assuming everyone is still on the line.","So let me conclude by saying, thank you to our shareholders. We appreciate your confidence and your support. Thank you to our customers. We appreciate your business. We wouldn't be in business without your business. So thank you.","And I want to say thank you to my Nucor teammates, for creating value for our customers, generating attractive returns for our shareholders and building a sustainable future for all of us. And most importantly, thank you all for doing it safely.","Thanks for your interest in Nucor. Have a great afternoon.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

Please go ahead, sir.","John Ferriola","Thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call and your interest in Nucor.","Other members of Nucor\u2019s executive team are also with me today. Joining us for the first time is our new Executive Vice President of Raw Materials, Craig Feldman. Craig is taking over for Jim Darsey, who retired last month. Craig is a proven leader with 33 years of experience at the David J. Joseph Company or DJJ, which Nucor acquired in 2008. He has served as President of DJJ within Nucor since 2013. His knowledge of the raw materials markets and our business is a great asset to our team. Welcome, Craig.","We also have Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Ladd Hall, responsible for Sheet and Tubular Products; Ray Napolitan, responsible for Engineered Bar Products, Dave Sumoski, responsible for Merchant Bar and Rebar Products; Leon Topalian, responsible for Beam and Plate Products, Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated Construction Products; and Joe Stratman, our Chief Digital Officer.","I will begin by sharing the highlights of our strong second quarter. Jim Frias will then provide more details about our financial performance.","We are pleased to report another strong quarter with net earnings of $2.13 per diluted share, a record for the second quarter. It is also the second strongest quarter in Nucor\u2019s history. Our steel mill capacity utilization in the second quarter of 2018 was an impressive 95% and improved year-over-year across all steel mill product groups. We achieved these results through continued disciplined execution of our five drivers to profitable growth and against the backdrop of a favorable economy and regulatory environment.","As we stated in the past, our five drivers to build long-term sustainable growth are, one, being a low cost producer; two, being a leader in the markets in which we compete; three, moving up the value chain to expand our capabilities for value-appreciative customers; four, expanding our channels to market; and five, achieving commercial excellence to complement our operational strength.","The strength of the U.S. economy was a major driver of our continued financial and operational success. Economic fundamentals began improving in the middle of 2017, and that trend has continued into this year. The economy is being energized by tax and regulatory reform, and by strength in the global energy markets where the U.S. has become a major producer and exporter.","These combined factors, a competitive U.S. corporate tax rate, favorable regulatory environment and strong U.S. energy production are the keys to the current strong business environment for Nucor.","With U.S. economic strength driving domestic steel demand, 22 of the 24 markets we serve are seeing increased or stable demand. The U.S. steel market is also benefiting from a reduction in unfairly traded imports entering our country, as a result of years of successful trade cases and the broad-based tariffs imposed under Section 232. Imports are down more than 7% through the first half of 2018. With all tariffs going into effect in June, we expect this trend to continue. The tariffs send a clear message that the U.S. is done asking nicely for compliance with the rules of trade and is serious about demanding changes in the trade practices of other countries.","The reduction in dumped and illegally subsidized steel should allow steel prices to return to their fair levels that are based upon market forces of supply and demand. Importantly, however, I want to note that Nucor\u2019s strong performance is not solely due to pricing environment. Increased capacity utilization also acted as a driver of our earnings strength this quarter. Higher utilization rates are essential for the long-term sustainability of the American steel industry.","As you\u2019re aware, Nucor has spent years positioning itself to take advantage of an upturn in the steel market. We have increased our workforce by 18% and invested $8 billion since the last cyclical peak in 2008. By investing in our people and our operations, we have made Nucor an even stronger business. We are now capitalizing on those investments to move up the value chain and profitably grow the Company. Our financial performance last year and during the first half of this year are proof that our long-term strategy of pursuing our five drivers to profitable growth is working. In the strong market, Nucor remains focused on continuing to successfully execute this discipline strategy.","We are currently implementing eight exciting growth initiatives, totaling more than $1.5 billion. Four of those investments are in the long products and total about $750 million. The projects include the rolling mill modernization at our Ohio rebar mill, MBQ expansion at our Illinois mill, and two rebar micro mills in Missouri and Florida. Site preparation is underway for the micro mill in Missouri. And we have already begun to hire team mates. The other four projects are in our sheet mill group and total approximately $780 million. These projects include a new galvanizing line at Gallatin, the specialty cold rolling mill and additional galvanizing line in Arkansas, and our joint venture with JFE Steel to build a galvanizing line in Mexico, which will serve the automotive market in that country. Completion dates for these eight projects range from 2019 through 2021.","We are clearly not finished growing Nucor\u2019s long-term earnings power, and we look forward to extending the Company\u2019s long track record of sustainable shareholder value-creation through these high-return organic investments.","Jim Frias will now provide more specific detail about our second quarter performance and financial position. Jim? ","Jim Frias","Thanks, John, and good afternoon.","Our second quarter 2018 earnings represent a substantial increase over our first quarter earnings of $1.10 per diluted share. As John noted, our improved earnings were the result of much stronger market conditions and our team\u2019s ability to deliver attractive returns on the significant investments Nucor made during the industry downturn. All three of our segments increased their profitability compared to the first quarter and last year\u2019s second quarter.","Our steel mill segment achieved strong earnings growth across all mill product groups, sheet, plate, rebar, merchant bar, engineered bars and beams. Profit growth at our downstream steel products segment was highlighted by the performance of our recently acquired tubular operations, serving the hollow structural sections and electrical conduit markets. Our raw material segment realized attractive profit contributions from our DJJ scrap business as well as both of our DRI facilities.","Nucor is continuing to aggressively invest in long-term, job-creating, profitable growth. Full-year 2018 capital spending is estimated to be approximately $1 billion. This is a significant increase from 2017 capital spending of $450 million. Approximately two-thirds of our planned 2018 capital expenditures are for expansion, product improvement, and cost savings projects with the remaining one-third for maintenance purposes. As we invest in our multiple growth platforms, Nucor is also rewarding shareholders with meaningful returns of capital. In the first half of 2018, the Company returned more than $400 million to shareholders via cash dividends of about $240 million and share repurchases of about $170 million. Capital returns in the first half of 2018 are consistent with our target to return to shareholders a minimum of 40% of our through the cycle earnings.","Two noteworthy facts provide evidence of Nucor\u2019s long-term record as an effective steward of our shareholders\u2019 valuable capital. First, 2018 marks Nucor\u2019s 45th consecutive year of increased regular or base dividends. Second, the average cost of Nucor\u2019s nearly 89 million shares of treasury stock repurchased life-to-date is less than $29 per share. That includes the just under 2.7 million shares repurchased in the first half of 2018.","In April, Nucor issued $500 million of 10-year notes at an interest rate of 3.95% and $500 million of 30-year notes at an interest rate of 4.4%. Combined with the December 2017 maturity of $600 million of 5.75% notes and the June 2018 maturity of $500 million of 5.85% notes, we lowered the weighted average fixed coupon rate of our long-term debt to 4.74% and lengthened weighted average maturity to just over 15 years.","Nucor\u2019s financial position and cash generation remain strong. With total debt outstanding of $4.3 billion, our gross debt to capital ratio was 31% at the end of the second quarter of 2018. Nucor\u2019s strong liquidity position includes our cash holdings of $1.5 billion and our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility\u2019s maturity was extended in the second quarter to April of 2023.","First half of 2018 cash provided by operating activities was very robust at approximately $870 million. Nucor\u2019s strong cash generation was achieved while at the same time funding the increased working capital requirements of a cyclical upturn. Based on strong market fundamentals and discussions with our customers, we believe there is sustainable strength in steel end-use markets. Our steel mill and steel product backlogs are robust and have trended upward since the beginning of the year.","Earnings in third quarter 2018 are expected to further improve compared to the second quarter of 2018. The performance of the steel mill segment is expected to remain strong in the third quarter of 2018 with margin expansion expected primarily at our sheet and plate mills. We expect the third quarter performance of our steel products segment to be similar to the second quarter of 2018. The performance of our raw material segment is expected to decrease in third quarter 2018 due to margin compression. Nucor\u2019s focus remains on delivering higher returns on our invested capital by taking care of our customers.","Thank you for your interest in our Company. John? ","John Ferriola","Thanks, Jim.","I\u2019d like to conclude with a brief comment on international trade. It is our view that the subject needs to be considered with a long-term perspective. What will happen to our great country, if we continue to operate with a massive trade imbalance that is over $560 billion and growing? We agree with the administration\u2019s efforts to address this issue. We believe these efforts will lead to a freer, fairer trade that will benefit manufacturers, our customers and American workers by creating a stronger domestic economy.","I want to thank all of our 25,000 teammates across Nucor for seizing the opportunities the strong market is provided. The leadership team in Charlotte appreciates the hard work you do every day to build a safer and more profitable Nucor.","We would now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go first to Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Terry","Good afternoon, guys. My first question is just around the capital return, so, the minimum 40% of the net income. Can you just comment a little on buybacks versus supplementary dividends that are possible into the end of the year and maybe into 2019?","Jim Frias","Yes. Thanks. This is Jim Frias, I will answer that question. We work very closely with our Board of Directors to develop a structure about how we think about returns to shareholders. And you know that one of the items we use, which is the income statement trigger. We want to return a minimum of 40% of earnings to shareholders. But, we also use the balance sheet as a guideline, because we\u2019re very committed to a strong investment grade credit rating. So, we look at the -- we have a range, we haven\u2019t published the debt-to-cap, but should be obvious, based on the idea that we want to maintain a strong investment grade rating.","If you look at our net-debt-to-cap position, and if our net-debt-to-cap is too low, we would probably do more return to shareholders; if we got too high, we might throttle things back. But, right now, we\u2019re in a place where we can easily return the full 40% to shareholders.","Secondly, when we choose between dividends and share repurchases, we use an intrinsic value miles that again we show the Board on a regular basis, so we project what the value of the company is based on our forecasted earnings. And when the stock is attractive, we prefer to buy back the stock versus dividends. If we think the stock is at a pricey level, we might do more supplemental dividends.","John Ferriola","This is John. The only thing I\u2019d add to that is of course our first priority will remain investing for profitable growth of our Company.","Chris Terry","And then, just on your commentary around the sheets and plates market and that helping the steel mill segment. Can you just talk specifically about the long products? If you look at the year-to-date, long product imports stand about 20% versus a 5% decline in sheets. How do you think about the performance of the bar and structural mills going forward?","John Ferriola","Well, long products has been strong in the second quarter, as we mentioned in the script. Frankly plates and sheets were doing better, but we certainly were pleased with our long products performance during the quarter. We did see imports down a little bit but we also see construction going up a little bit. And that served us well in our long products, particularly in the rebar markets.","Chris Terry","Okay. And the last one for me, just on the raw materials segment. Can you just talk through the progress, Louisiana DRI plant? And what impacts from the DRI outage is considered within the guidance that you\u2019ve mentioned coming out for 3Q?","John Ferriola","Well, we have the outage baked into our guidance. And I\u2019ll give you just a quick update on the shutdown. As I mentioned on our last call, this was planned shutdown to perform preventive and predictive maintenance on the facility, scheduled to be down for about 30 days. And we are scheduled to produce [prime] [ph] DRI sometime tomorrow. The vessel is heated, it\u2019s loaded, and we are building pressure in it now. So, as of right now, it looks pretty good for a start-up, successful start-up for producing [prime] [ph] DRI tomorrow sometime during the day.","Operator","We will hear next from Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Korn","So, I had a couple of questions on the product side. We are coming up in about two years since you assembled the tubular division. You are now running at above 1.1 million annual run rate. How has that division in particular performed relative to your expectations, financial, operational efficiency, overall cost effect across the Nucor platform? Then, where can it go from here? Can you get to 1.2, 1.3 million tons or higher? Then, finally, do you see any cannibalization from your other products? Now, with HSS demand grows. Does that have any effect on what you are selling or how you are selling structural beams or elsewhere?","John Ferriola","Okay. Great, great, great, yes and no. Okay. Let me elaborate just a little bit on that. The performance of the tubular group has been outstanding. Frankly, it did surpass our expectations. We knew it would be a good acquisition. We knew based on their culture, they would fit well into the organization. We knew that there would be value in the synergies that were going across our sheet group. We knew that it would be profitable standing on its own. And all of those things came to fruition. The impact on our sheet business has been great. And I\u2019d add this. One of the concerns we had as we entered into this was that we might lose some of business from competitors to our existing tubular [indiscernible], some other tubular products that we -- excuse me, customers that we currently sell to. What\u2019s actually happened is our business with the competitors has actually increased. And I think it\u2019s a function of working with sheet group and our tubular group. We\u2019ve been able to fine-tune and tweak the chemistries that we produced in our steel. And we\u2019ve learned how to produce steel that runs more efficiently and effectively in the tubular business.","So, on all of those fronts, and it\u2019s been a homerun. We\u2019ve been really, really pleased with it. We are on track this year. We think there we will do little bit more than last year, and that last year was somewhere around 900,000 tons; our forecast for this year is about 1.1, 1.2 million tons. And we really haven\u2019t seen a negative impact on any of our other construction or structurally related products. If anything, you would -- with the latest mill that we\u2019re putting in to our tubular division that will be working more closely with our skyline division. We expect that to be another synergy that will bring value to both tubular and to our skyline business.","Matthew Korn","Got it. Thanks, John. I appreciate the elaboration. Following up from that, what does that opportunity set for any acquisitions look like for you today, as you\u2019re thinking about capital allocation? And after putting together tubular, your focus has been on investment, as you elaborated really in the call on Arkansas and micro mills, you think those assets taken out, [indiscernible]. Is there anything out there that\u2019s really interesting in steel-making, is there another Gallatin out there that we\u2019re overlooking?","John Ferriola","We don\u2019t look at just steel-making. As you know, we look at all of our product groups, plus all of our businesses. And yes, there is nothing specific that I want to speak to, but we\u2019re keeping our eye on all opportunities and we\u2019ll respond when the appropriate opportunity becomes available at the appropriate price that fits well into our organization.","Operator","We\u2019ll hear next from Seth Rosenfeld with Jefferies.","Seth Rosenfeld","Couple of quick questions today. First on intersegment eliminations, you saw very significant increase quarter-over-quarter, I believe in the last quarter you guided to in fact decrease in Q2. Can you just help us explain, help us sort of understand just why was that increase in pricing guidance, how is the trend moving forward?","Jim Frias","This is Jim Frias, I will answer that. Elims went up by roughly a $133 million in the second quarter compared to first quarter. And there is four major things that make that up. One is actual intercompany inventory revaluation process, now I\u2019ll save that for last because that\u2019s probably the most significant piece. Then, there is this compensation piece that\u2019s related to stock - stock units and options. There is a June 1 grant date for those that our Board authorizes. And so, therefore, there\u2019s a spike in the second quarter every year. So, in the first quarter, those expenses were about $9 million and in the second quarter they were closer to $37 million. So, that increased by about $28 million quarter over quarter; it will go back to a more normal run rate for the balance of the year. So, this is an event that happens every second quarter. We get a spike related to that stock compensation. And then, profit sharing, we think 10% of our pretax profits is set aside for teammates. That expense increased, basically doubled from $47 million to $48 million, almost $49 million in second quarter.","Interest expense is another piece. Interest expense is actually down; it went from just under $36 million, down to $28 million. So, we saved about $7 million there. But then, the inventory valuation piece increased by $63 million, went from $49 million to more than $112 million. And as we look at that, the things that affected are the volume of inventory and the margin per ton of inventory. So, the volume we thought was going to stay flat; it went up by roughly 9%. We have got just over 7.6 million tons of inventory in the Company and that includes DRI, scrap and steel. And we tracked the DRI, not just to the steel mills but all the way to the finished products that have the DRI and scrap embedded in them. So, there is an increasing volume of 9% that happened. And then, secondly, margins improved by about 28% in the second quarter.","So going forward, the question is will volumes change. We would think volumes will stay really flat, relatively flat in the third quarter. We think that they reached a fairly close to run rate level. And margins might go up a little bit but not nearly the same pace. So, we wouldn\u2019t expect to see the same kind of a number. So, we would expect that intercompany or that inventory elims piece to be lower in Q3 than Q2. We are not going to give an absolute number because it really depends on some variables that are hard to predict. But, our gut feel is it\u2019s going to be lower because of those factors. Does that help?","Seth Rosenfeld","Yes. That helps. Thank you. And one further question, please, on the plate market. Can you just give us a bit more color on how you characterize current demand and pricing trends looking ahead in second half of the year? Plate perhaps stands out as one of the products where there is not significant capacity growth, digging out by yourselves or any of your peers in the U.S. What do you think it would take to make plate attractive area to allocate capital?","John Ferriola","Well, our plate business in the second quarter was very strong, frankly second only to our sheet business. Some of our volumes were off a little bit in second quarter, it was basically because of some operational issues that we had at our Hertford and at Tuscaloosa, mill. They were operational issues that we took care of and we\u2019re back into -- back going steady now.","In terms of capital, moving forward, we would see plate as one of the areas, like I said earlier that we would consider. Certainly it\u2019s been a good business for us. It\u2019s a cyclical business, probably one of our most cyclical businesses. And over the long-term it\u2019s been good for us. If the right opportunities came along, we would certainly be willing to invest in growing plate.","One of the things that we hold out a lot of hope for, both our structural and our plate business is the infrastructure that we need to see some form of an infrastructure bill. While we are pretty confident we won\u2019t see it this year, we do hope that next year, we\u2019ll find Washington working together in a way that could bring a much needed infrastructure bill and it\u2019s going to have to be put significantly to deal with the crumbling infrastructure that we have today. So, we think that as infrastructure continues to -- beyond on the horizon, construction continues to improve, plate and structural see a better demand.","Operator","We will hear now from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners","I want to I guess beat this dead horse on capital allocation because as you point out is your second best quarter ever. You expect very strong demand, continuing second highest steel prices in the U.S. history at least for some products. So, I understand you want to stay investment grade. But if you continue on this track of generating the amount of free cash flow you did, you would be at well over 2 billion annually, right, just to extrapolate. So, I just want to understand if you look historically at your pattern and very strong earnings environment, you did buy back a lot of shares if we look back like 2007. Is that a good playbook for how you\u2019re thinking about allocating capital? I mean, is it possible that you do something similar as what you did then? Are you still contemplating special dividends as a tactic as you did then, if you could just elaborate a little more?","John Ferriola","I\u2019m going to reiterate what I said a little bit earlier and that is that look, our first priority is profitable growth of our Company. So, we\u2019re going to continue to look for opportunities to profitably grow Company. We think that there might be some out there. We\u2019re going to continue to look at all of them that come available. If at the end of the day, we\u2019re in a position where we do reach that nice round number of 2 billion that you threw out there and there isn\u2019t anything out on the horizon that we think would result in profitable growth of our company, then we will do what we always say we will do. We\u2019ll return the valuable capital to our shareholders.","Right now, I think it\u2019s a case of we\u2019re keeping our powder a little bit dry, still a little early. Remember that, one of the great advantages we have in having such a strong balance sheet was the ability to act quickly when opportunities do come up. And I would point to, the tubular acquisition. We have an opportunity to grow the company profitability with three acquisition in a fairly short period of time. To do that, we have to have almost $1 billion in cash. And we\u2019re -- because of our strong position and because of our conservative financial practices, we had $1 billion. Bear in mind that those three acquisitions were done over a period of about six or eight weeks. So, for us to be very quick -- obviously, the sellers like it when they deal with us and they know that we have the cash to provide and we can tell it\u2019s a cash deal. So, we want to keep a strong balance sheet so that when those opportunities come up, we can act quickly and decisively.","Now, if they don\u2019t come up, now we fall back on returning it to our shareholders. And then, as Jim mentioned earlier, we\u2019ll do an evaluation. If it makes more sense to do it with dividends, we will do with dividends; if we think that stock price is at a value where it creates more value by repurchasing shares, then we will repurchase shares. I don\u2019t know how much more we can go into helping you beat that dead horse. But really that\u2019s our view.","Timna Tanners","I thought I would try, fair enough. The other question I wanted ask is\u2026","John Ferriola","We appreciate you trying. We like that.","Timna Tanners","You\u2019re close to the White House and your talks with them, there\u2019s been a bit more coming out, not just Section 232 but antidumping case of steel content. Can you give us your latest taste of the further types of cases that we might see? Do you think that there is going to be more such cases with steel content and steel products coming into the U.S that would be targeted by these types of cases?","John Ferriola","We always are looking at that and we\u2019re not going to stop prosecuting case because of 232 or any other form of comprehensive transaction. We recognize that when you have a trade case that we\u2019re successful in prosecuting, that\u2019s a minimum of five years with the ability to do a sunset review to extent it maybe another five years. So, that\u2019s a very long-term success. So, we\u2019re going to continue to looking at them. There are couple. I\u2019m not going to get into specifics. But I will tell you there are couple of products that we\u2019re all looking at right now. We believe they are good, solid cases. And if we prosecute them, we will be successful in those cases. I will point out that we\u2019ve got a great track record -- and I mean the industry, I\u2019m not speaking exclusively of Nucor, but the industry has got incredible track. If I have the numbers right, I think it\u2019s about 15 cases we prosecuted since around 2014, and we haven\u2019t lost one. I mean, there might have been a couple of countries that was in the cases that got away. But as a general statement, we\u2019ve been extremely successful in prosecuting the cases. That points to two things. It points to number one, the egregious nature of the violations that have been and in some cases still are occurring; and it points to the growing understanding by the ITC of the games that are being played as these violating countries continue to play the whack-a-mole game.","So, we\u2019re going to continue to do that. I will say on the 232, we continue to be strong advocates of the 232. We currently speak about whack-a-mole quite a bit. And the 232 provides a comprehensive trade remedy that eliminates that ability to go around with country and product substitution that drive us crazy, each case taking two years to prosecute. So, all-in-all, we\u2019re very happy with tariffs, with the 232 action. We believe that the 232 is justified. We believe that the incredibly massive trade deficit needs to be addressed. And we think that trade -- 232 and tariffs will help trading partners come back to the table and come back and reach a more reasonable balanced trade agreement, which I think is good for the steel industry, it\u2019s good for our customers and it\u2019s good for the American workers.","Operator","We\u2019ll hear next from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Phil Gibbs","I wanted to drill down a little bit into the raw material division. The stated profits were better than what you did in all of 2017 in total. I think, it was odd considering that you have a DRI outage and there was -- ferrous prices started to level out on the scrap side. Should we think at all that the high eliminations, corporate eliminations that you had offset some of those obstacle surge in profits? It was just really, really strange to see that type of number in my model, and so I\u2019m just trying to think through it.","John Ferriola","Let me help you with that a little bit. There was a little bit of effect on what you mentioned. But frankly though, the largest effect would be our Louisiana facility. It\u2019s been running very stable, it\u2019s going well for the last 4, 5, 6 months. That\u2019s been a big plus. I also have to give kudos and a call out of thanks to our DJ Joseph team. They have continued to improve the efficiency of their processing operations. They\u2019ve reduced their costs and continue to do so over the last year and particularly over the last six months. They\u2019ve done a fantastic job of becoming more efficient.","We\u2019ve also mentioned on the call a few times an initiative that we call the mill alignment program. And that is not only extra value to our steel mills, but have healthy efficiency of our DJ Joseph operations. And finally, our team in Trinidad, once again, every time we say they can\u2019t push that any further and become any more profitable and effective and efficient, they seem to find a way to do that. Once again, over the last quarter, they\u2019ve been a stellar performer and that has contributed the [indiscernible].","Phil Gibbs","Okay. John, as you look into the third quarter, I think you did mention some gross margin pressures coming in that division. And as we look at it, we\u2019ve seen non-ferrous prices decline, particularly for copper, and we\u2019re starting to see some pretty staggering declines in shutter byproduct pricing, particularly in China. Are those things the biggest driver to some of the margin weakness relative to Q2 you are talking about?","John Ferriola","I\u2019d say that they\u2019re the biggest factor. Craig, do you want to add anything to that?","Craig Feldman","Yes. I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably the only headwind we see right now is China and pretty well publicized. They have made a statement that they are going to eliminate their purchase of a lot of scrap from 2020, which we\u2019ve been working on that for quite some time. So, it was not a surprise to us. We have been accelerating our attempt to go to furnace ready aluminum products and non-ferrous products I\u2019d say.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we will move next to Piyush Sood.","Piyush Sood","A couple of question for me. We heard some comments in the AMM conference on the second DRI plant at Louisiana, and I think a flat roll mill on the West Coast. Could you talk a little bit more about them?","John Ferriola","That was me. I was responding to a question that whether we would have any interest in being on the West Coast and whether or not I thought that DRI was a long-term, sustainable and valuable asset. So, yes, I do think that -- I\u2019ll start with DRI. I do believe, as I have said many times, I think as the time goes on because of the things that\u2019s talked about many times, recycling of prime scrap, reduction of manufacturing in the United States. That prime scrap is going to continue to come under pressure and become less available. And we, Nucor, we are going to need more of it as we continue to move up the value chain, so our presence in ultra-high strength steels and automotive steels. So, yes, we are going to continue with these prime, virgin iron units for some time. And we have also talked in the past and will reiterate concerns about getting our pig iron from geopolitically unstable regions such as Brazil can be challenge but certainly Russia and the Ukraine. HBI coming out of Venezuela is not the most stable country in the world. So, we see a need to make sure that we can take care of our needs of virgin iron units, so that we can continue to move up the value chain. So, at some point, we will make an evaluation on the second DRI plant. If we feel that that\u2019s necessary, as mentioned in the past that we have all of the infrastructure in place to expand to the second facility and we will consider that at the right time.","As far as the West Coast goes, the question really surrounded -- was surrounding cash. And we were talking about cash at the time and in relevance to the West Coast. I mentioned that that would be a good location for our cash, if we haven -- did want to get out to the West Coast because of the limited market and the limited production from the cash to facility. At this time, there are no plans or anything moving out to the West Coast.","Piyush Sood","And second question, as the U.S. has put Section 232 tariffs, some other counties have retaliated with their own tariffs. So, how you are thinking about your exports in the coming months? Do you see any concern in U.S.?","John Ferriola","Well, we\u2019ve done analysis and there will be some impact but it won\u2019t be major. One of the things that you have to recall is that particularly if you look at our rebar business, it will be limited to us what we can send out into Canada which is actually shipping into Canada. But remember, rebar will not be coming into the country from other countries also. So, we actually see it as a net zero situation. In fact, for us, we will be able to serve regional markets a little bit better with scrap with -- with rebar that we\u2019ve been selling [ph] out of this country. And remember too that we have our micro mills that will be coming up over the next year or two that will help us speed what we believe will be an increased demand locally and domestically for rebar. So, no, we all see a major impact at our plant in galv line in Mexico. I hope you got a question about that but that will be serving the automotive market in Mexico. So, we don\u2019t see a negative impact on that. So, overall, we will have some impact. It won\u2019t be major. We believe that at the end of the day, there will be net gain for the steel I general and frankly to the United States\u2019 economy and to our Company as a result of what\u2019s happening in trade.","Operator","We\u2019ll hear now from Alex Hacking with Citi. ","Alex Hacking","So, you had a very good strong quarter on volumes. Are you sensing any increase in inventory levels at your customers, or is this simply a reflection of strong underlying demand and lower imports? Thanks.","John Ferriola","No, actually I was just was looking at service center inventories this morning. And thankfully, there are all running extremely low, somewhere in the neighborhood of 2.2 to 2.3. And that\u2019s a relatively low number. We see a small uptick in some of the merchant product that\u2019s been very small. And you also have to look at the shipments. And the service center shipments have been up pretty significantly over the quarter or so, that helps the inventory situation. And talking to our customers, I would say that there certainly is an abundance of inventory on our customers side, OEMs, they\u2019re running pretty lean, but we are filling our commitments and making sure that they get steel that they need to produce their products and keep their customers happy.","Alex Hacking","Thanks for the color. And I\u2019m assuming with the changes on import and Section 232 that you\u2019re having some people knocking on your door that we\u2019re new or haven\u2019t knocked on your door for while looking for steel. I guess, are you seeing a lot of new customers coming through? Is it a trickle or is it more of a flood in terms of looking for steel companies that haven\u2019t come around in a while? Thanks.","John Ferriola","I guess I would say somewhere between the trickle and the flood. Obviously, we\u2019re taking care of our long-term royal customers and that\u2019s happening. We\u2019ve seen a notable increase in their request for steel and we\u2019ve been able to meet the request. We have had some new customers come to the door; when possible we take care of those customers. One of the things that we look for when we consider allocating some of our times to those new customers is just how strategic those customers are, what products are they in, do they support our desire and strategic plan to move into the higher value products. So, we take a look at lot of factors. But I would say, A, first, we take care of our long-term loyal customers; secondly, we have been helping our customers who\u2019ve been new to us, whenever we can and particularly when they\u2019ve been strategic to our long-term marketing strategy.","Operator","And at this time, for closing remarks, I would like to turn things back to John Ferriola.","John Ferriola","So, let me close by saying thanks to our customers. We appreciate the opportunity to talking with you and to run your business every day. And Nucor\u2019s always ready to join with you to seize new opportunities. And thank you to our shareholders. We appreciate your long-term and ongoing confidence in our team. And finally, to my Nucor teammates, let\u2019s keep winning together. Thank you for what you do for Nucor every day. And most importantly, thank you for doing it safely. Thank you all for your interest in Nucor. Have a good day.","Operator","Again, that will conclude today\u2019s conference.

More information about the risks and uncertainties related to these forward-looking statements may be found in Nucor's latest 10-K and subsequently filed 10-Qs, which are available on SEC's and Nucor's websites.","The forward-looking statements made in this conference call speak only as of this date, and Nucor does not assume any obligation to update them, either as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Ferriola, Chief Executive Officer and President of Nucor Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.","John J. Ferriola","Good afternoon. This is John Ferriola, Nucor's President and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior leadership team: Dan DiMicco, Nucor's Executive Chairman; Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; and our other Executive Vice Presidents: Jim Darsey; Keith Grass; Ladd Hall; Ham Lott; and Joe Stratman. First and most importantly, we want to thank everyone on Nucor's, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for your hard work, taking care of all of our customers in today's very challenging market conditions. As always, you are doing it by working safely, working smart and working together. In fact, you achieved Nucor's best-ever safety performance in 2012. Congratulations and thank you. Please stay focused on our Beyond Zero safety goal. Beyond Zero means we don't just target 0 injuries or illnesses, but also 0 near-misses and 0 potential for any safety incident. You are Nucor's greatest assets and our real competitive advantage, the right people. Thank you all. Every day, you are building a safer, stronger and more profitable Nucor.","As we announced on November 16, I became Nucor's CEO at the start of this year. Dan DiMicco remains a key member of our team, serving as our Executive Chairman. These moves reflect the planned, thoughtful transition of leadership at Nucor. Our company's robust executive succession planning process has been a priority of Dan's from the very beginning of his tenure as Nucor's CEO. It will also be a priority of mine so that the next transition is as seamless as this transition.","Dan became Nucor's leader in September of 2000. He served as our CEO longer than anyone since our founder, Ken Iverson. Under Dan's leadership, Nucor delivered dramatic growth in profits and shareholder returns. From September of 2000 through the year end of 2012, Nucor's total shareholder return growth of 720% was almost 4x greater than the total return of the S&P Steel Group Index, and was 28x greater than the S&P 500's total return.","In addition to this impressive record of profitable growth, Dan became an extremely effective champion for domestic manufacturing and rules-based, rules-enforced free trade. Most important of all, Dan strengthened and grew Nucor's culture over a period that included 2 of the steel industry's worst downcycles. I am excited, honored and humbled to serve as Nucor's new CEO. Dan's shoes are extremely big ones to fill. Nevertheless, I share Dan's conviction that Nucor's best days are ahead of us.","Our strength is our culture. Nucor's culture is defined by its drive for continual improvement. We are never as good today as we are going to be tomorrow, because we are always working to become better. The 22,000 men and women on the Nucor team, the right people, are looking forward to converting the significant investments made during the current downturn into profits that will give us higher highs when the next upcycle arrives.","I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to discuss our fourth quarter results and financial position. Following Jim, I will update you on Nucor's growth strategy. Jim?","James D. Frias","Thanks, John, and good afternoon. Fourth quarter 2012 earnings of $0.43 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of between $0.25 to $0.30 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results included a larger-than-expected LIFO credit of $0.14 per diluted share compared to our guidance of $0.06 per diluted share. Nucor's fourth quarter performance also benefited from stronger-than-expected operating profits at our sheet, plate and beam mills.","A quick comment about our tax rate, since it can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting out profits belonging to our business partners, the fourth quarter of 2012 effective tax rate was 30.3%. For full year 2012, Nucor's effective tax rate was 34%.","Overall market conditions remained extremely challenging in 2012. However, difficult steel markets highlight the value and strength of Nucor's business model. The best evidence is provided by Nucor's ability to generate strong cash flow through cyclical downturns. 2012 cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.2 billion from 2011's operating cash flow of $1 billion. During the current cyclical downturn from 2009 through 2012, average annual cash generated from operations is more than double the amount generated during the last downturn from 2001 through 2003. Our growth strategy's objective is higher highs and higher lows in the returns achieved through successive business cycles.","Balance sheet strength remains another important attribute of Nucor's business model. Taking advantage of our healthy cash flow and liquidity position, we retired $650 million in maturing long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2012. Nucor's total debt-to-capital ratio is now 31.7%. That is down 4 percentage points from year end 2011. In addition to reducing our leverage, our strong cash flow and liquidity allowed us to continue Nucor's long tradition of growing stronger during downturns.","Our capital spending for 2012 totaled $948 million, with most of this capital invested in growth projects. We also invested $675 million in the acquisition of Skyline Steel. This acquisition expands our growth opportunities in the steel piling business. Skyline is off to an excellent start as a member of the Nucor team.","Nucor continues to enjoy a healthy liquidity position. Cash, short-term investments and restricted cash totaled $1.4 billion at the end of 2012. Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn, and it does not mature until December 2016. We have no commercial paper outstanding. Standard & Poor's, in its January 16 quarterly report entitled, \"U.S. Metals and Mining Companies, Strongest to Weakest\", again ranked Nucor #1 for credit rating and outlook among the universe of 67 companies. Nucor was also the only steel company in the group that S&P awarded a strong business risk profile due to our competitive position and profit performance relative to our peers. We are the only steel producer in North America to enjoy the extremely important competitive advantage of an investment-grade credit rating. The benefits of our credit rating include: A lower cost of capital, financial flexibility and our position as the lowest risk counterparty for both customers and suppliers. Our natural gas working interest investments to support Nucor's raw material strategy are an excellent example of how financial strength pays off for Nucor.","In 2013, we will continue to take advantage of Nucor's position of strength to grow Nucor's long-term earnings power and shareholder value. 2013 capital expenditures are expected to exceed $1.1 billion. We are implementing a number of projects throughout our upstream steelmaking and downstream businesses to develop new products, increase quality and reduce costs. Significant items in this year's capital budget include: Approximately $280 million for our Louisiana DRI facility; approximately $260 million for our natural gas-related investments; approximately $150 million to expand our SBQ production capabilities at our bar mills in South Carolina, Nebraska and Tennessee; approximately $100 million to expand our Nucor-Yamato structural mills portfolio of sheet piling products; approximately $80 million to produce wider and lighter gauge hot rolled sheet at our South Carolina flat-rolled mill; and a number of other attractive projects, ranging from the addition of a normalizing line at our North Carolina plate mill to a new reheat furnace at our Connecticut bar mill.","In 2013, Nucor's investing significant capital in 2 natural gas drilling programs that we believe will secure a reliable, low-cost supply of natural gas for our current and expected future needs for more than 20 years. These agreements are with Encana USA for onshore natural gas drilling in the continental United States. The drilling of natural gas wells resulting from these 2 programs is expected to provide enough natural gas to equal Nucor's usage at all of our steel mills, plus the usage of 2 DRI facilities; or alternatively, 3 DRI plants.","We expect successful execution of our raw material strategy, which is comprised of DRI production paired with this long-term and low-cost supply of natural gas, to be a game-changer for the cost structure of Nucor's sheet, plate and SBQ steelmaking operations. The raw material strategy is also a game-changer by shortening Nucor's supply chain for high-quality iron units.","In addition to allowing us to invest in attractive growth opportunities, our strong financial position and cash flow generation has enabled Nucor to build an impressive record of cash dividends paid to our shareholders. Academic studies consistently show that dividends are a large component of long-term shareholder returns.","In December, Nucor's board increased our regular, or base, dividend for the 40th consecutive year. Driven by the Nucor team's success in growing long-term earnings power, the base quarterly dividend has been increased approximately tenfold over the past 12 years.","For the first quarter of 2013, Nucor's earnings are expected to decline from the fourth quarter of 2012. This reflects our outlook for stable performance at our operations and a small first quarter LIFO charge in contrast to the fourth quarter's very large LIFO credit. Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance in the final month of the quarter. Our team is excited by the opportunities we see ahead to reward Nucor shareholders with very attractive long-term returns on their valuable capital. John?","John J. Ferriola","Thanks, Jim. After 4 years of recession and at best, modest economic growth, we still cannot see signs of a full economic recovery. Steel mill, steel market conditions remain very challenging. This is evidenced by a current capacity utilization of just 75% for the U.S. steel industry. Nonresidential construction activity has shown modest improvement, but remains at anemic levels. Relatively stronger end-use markets remain: Automotive, heavy equipment, and energy.","Imports, which are being dumped in many instances, continue to present a serious challenge to the U.S. steel industry's recovery. Preliminary U.S. Census Bureau data for December of 2012 indicate full year 2012 imports at 26.7 million tons. That is a 17% increase from 2011 imports of 22.8 million tons and a whopping 38% increase from 2010 imports of 19.3 million tons. By contrast, the U.S. steel mills increased their production by less than 10% over the same 2-year period. These import levels make no sense whatsoever when you consider both the sluggish domestic economic recovery and the fact that American producers, overall, are among the lowest cost producers of steel in the world.","Nucor will continue to be proactive in bringing attention to the critical need for our government to enforce rules-based free trade. The existing way of the global trading stage is more than just a threat to the profitability of Nucor and our customers, it is a major obstacle, blocking the path of sustainable recovery for the U.S. economy. There's a growing awareness among policymakers and the overall public that this crisis must be dealt with and sooner, rather than later. We are extremely fortunate that Dan DiMicco will continue his work to promote a strong, vibrant U.S. manufacturing base.","Challenging economic times provide opportunities to businesses that have financial strength and disciplined strategies to grow profitably. We have good news again to share with you this quarter about our work to grow stronger during the current cyclical downturn. Our Arkansas sheet mill successfully started up its twin tank vacuum degasser during the fourth quarter. Vacuum degassing removes carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen from molten steel. This is necessary for the production of steels with enhanced formability, improved electrical efficiency and decreased susceptibility to hydrogen-induced cracking. The degasser will expand our value-added product offerings to a number of markets. It is also strategically positioned as the westernmost flat-roll degasser in the U.S. and is in a prime location to serve the growing Mexican market.","Nucor continued to enjoy success in expanding its presence in automotive markets during 2012. Shipments were up almost 20% over 2011. Our North Carolina plate mill is on schedule to start up its normalizing line later this year. The mill's new vacuum tank degasser that started up in 2012 is now in commercial production on new business for bridge and armor applications.","Construction is going well in our DRI facility in Louisiana. We are on schedule for a startup in mid-2013. The Nucor Steel Louisiana team continues to get the job done despite ongoing weather challenges, as rainfall has been heavy in recent weeks. This follows the previous challenge presented by last summer's record low levels of the Mississippi River.","Our international commercial team again demonstrated in 2012 Nucor's global competitiveness. International shipments represented 10.4% of total steel shipments last year. We continue to grow our international footprint in these very difficult market conditions. As you can see, Nucor is growing stronger. A stronger Nucor is one positioned to deliver for our shareholders higher highs and higher lows in earnings through successive economic cycles. Since the last cyclical peak in 2008, through disciplined execution of our multipronged growth strategy, we have invested nearly $7 billion of our shareholders' valuable capital through the end of 2012; and with our expected 2013 capital spending of more than $1 billion, our cumulative investments since the last cyclical peak will total approximately $8 billion.","These investments have dramatically increased Nucor's long-term earnings power. During the next several years, our focus will remain on executing our strategic plan and converting those $8 billion in investments into profits once the next cyclical upturn inevitably arrives in the economy and in our markets. That said, we will continue to plan for tomorrow while executing today. We will continue to be opportunistic and take advantage of our strong balance sheet to capitalize on uniquely attractive investments as they become available. And given the breadth of our multiple business platforms, I am confident we will continue to find investments that grow shareholder value for Nucor.","With our disciplined focus and by working together as a team, we will build on Nucor's long-term record of success in rewarding our shareholders with attractive returns on their valuable capital invested in our company. As Dan DiMicco has said many times, and I firmly believe, Nucor's best years are still ahead of us.","Thank you for your interest in Nucor. We would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And for our first question, we go to Michelle Applebaum with Steel Market Intelligence.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","First, I want to congratulate you on your promotion. It was very well deserved and also say, I guess I don't want to say goodbye to Dan, but I guess, new mode of -- or congratulations, I guess, to Dan on his new job. Maybe that's the way to do it as well, on his promotion.","John J. Ferriola","That's the way to say it, and I certainly don't want you saying goodbye to Dan.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","My question for you is, can you give me your thoughts about what will be different and what will be the same in your tenure?","John J. Ferriola","I'd be happy to do that, Michelle. Well, let me start with what will be a little different. As I mentioned in the script, we've invested, by the end of 2013, we will have invested $8 billion in our strategic plan. So over the next several years, our focus will be on executing that plan, converting those investments to higher highs during the next upcycle. That will be our focus. Let me talk a little bit about some of the things that'll be the same. First of all, most importantly, our absolute commitment to safety will remain unchanged. Our belief that there is nothing more important than safety will remain the same and our relentless drive to achieve Beyond Zero will not change. We believe strongly that maximizing safety maximizes our teams' communication and productivity. Shareholders benefit from our safety focus in many ways. We'll stay committed to our mission statement to take care of our customers, all of our customers, the way we have defined them in the past. We'll remain committed to a strong balance sheet. We're in a highly cyclical business and remaining committed to a strong balance sheet in a cyclical business allows us to weather those economic cycles without having to divest the valuable people or assets. And as we've shown during this recent downcycle, that discipline has allowed us to take advantage of some strategic assets at attractive pricing. We remain committed to growing our business through the long-term perspective that we've always had. Our goal being long-term, sustainable, profitable growth. We remain committed to capital, to the previous capital deployments priorities that we had, investing in long-term profitable growth, return capital to our investors with a strong base dividend, provide a supplemental dividend when economic conditions allow and opportunistically buy back stock only when other capital deployment commitments are fully satisfied and we believe that the stock is an excellent value. So that's a little bit about what will be different and what will be the same.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","That's great.","John J. Ferriola","Michelle, let me add one more point. I should've mentioned this. Of course we remain, as a team, committed to our strategic growth plan, the 5-pronged growth strategy that we've had over the last 10 years.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","Okay. Listen, I just want to tell you guys both and your whole team, and I know this with certainty, Ken would have been very, very proud, and I am.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Luke Folta with Jefferies.","Luke Folta - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The first kind of question I had was when you look at the investments that you're making in steel, there's numerous investments in expanding capacity, SBQ, some things going on in your structural business, wide and light project and all that, I wanted to get a sense of -- I mean, essentially, these are investments you're making at pretty attractive capital costs that will expand your steel capacity without having to build any new melt capacity, per se. So I mean, they're good investments. But I guess, I wanted to get some sense of how much additional shipment opportunity that these investments are going to generate over time. The reason I ask, I guess is, because when we listen to your competitor, Steel Dynamics, talk about some of their initiatives, and I think they get a decent amount of credit, rightfully so, for some of the things they're doing in rail and the SBQ expansions there. And for them, because they report production by mill, it's really easy to kind of tally up what the potential benefit could be. And I guess, I'm trying to get there with Nucor, to try to generate some of the similar math.","John J. Ferriola","Well, as you know, Luke, we do not talk about individual mills or even with our product groups' individual production levels. But if you look at the investments that we've made, they have not only been in steel, but they've been over the full value chain of our business, and that's how we'll continue to focus and that's how you need to think about the investments and the returns that we'll get during the next upcycle. We made substantial investments in our steel side for sure, and not only on the volume side, but certainly growing value-added products. So it's more than just looking at how many tons we will ship during the next upcycle. It's the mix of the tons that we will ship during the next upcycle. In addition to that, we continue to grow upstream and downstream. The recent acquisition of the Skyline asset, a tremendous opportunity, a tremendous addition to the Nucor family. As the economy and our markets recovery -- recover, they will be a large contributor to our business.","James D. Frias","John, I just would add one thing. We have disclosed SBQ tonnage increments from those investments, and it was about 1 million tons. And Luke, I'd also say that we'll be able to operate at a higher utilization rate through the economic cycle because we'll be able to ship products that we don't make today because of the fact that we're expanding the range of products we make. So our utilization rates, on average, will be higher through the cycle than they have been in the past.","Luke Folta - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you give us some color on what the magnitude of the wide and light project should be, just as far as how much tonnage you could produce at those gauges?","John J. Ferriola","Joe, do you want to take a shot at that, or Ladd?","Ladd R. Hall","Joe can. Luke, the wide and light project is not going to add significant additional tons and it's going to allow us, as Jim said, to get us to the value added -- it'll be significantly higher margins than what we've been able to do. But our tonnage from our Berkeley mill for that project will not increase.","Luke Folta - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But what percentage of Berkeley do you think will be in that product mix, that the wide and light project is -- is it going to be 20%, 25%?","Ladd R. Hall","No, the usual [indiscernible] right around the 10% to 15% range.","John J. Ferriola","One of the things we might want to point out, we talked during the script about the importance of us growing in the automotive market, growing the right way in the automotive market, and this is an investment that will allow us to continue growing in that market segment. As we mentioned in the script, the automotive market continues to be one of the markets that has remained strong during this downturn. If you look at 2012 auto sales, I believe they came in at about 14.5 million tons, which was about 12% or 13% higher than last year, last year being previous year, in 2011. But we expect them to increase again in 2013, we expect automotive sales to top out at about 15 million tons. So the automotive market is a strong market, and has remained strong during this downturn. The wide and light project at Berkeley will allow us to further penetrate that market. Again, it's an issue of not significantly more tons, but value-added, higher-value tons into a value-appreciative market.","Luke Folta - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one more, if I could, on the natural gas project. I appreciate your forecast for CapEx into next year, so -- but in the press release, when it was initially put out there, there were some big numbers, I guess it was $3.6 billion expected to be spent over some longer-term timeframe and it was a pretty wide range given, as far as over what timeframe that would be spent. Can you just maybe put into perspective for us, over the next kind of, 1 to 5 years, what the spending annually could amount to for that project, and also, maybe what the, some sense of what the benefit could be, or maybe some numbers that could help, at least, put that into perspective?","R. Joseph Stratman","Sure, Luke. This is Joe Stratman. I'd be happy take a shot at that. I would say, over the next 2 to 5 years, just '13 and for the next 4 or 5 years after that, the spend should be approximately in the same ballpark. And as you might imagine, and you know probably the natural gas drilling business a little bit, you're deploying capital and you're drilling wells and the wells come on and they produce for a very long period of time. But one well certainly doesn't produce all the gas that we're talking about in these programs, so you're drilling multiple wells over a series of years and the gas will be drilled for a number of years, will produce for a number of years more. So when we talk about the natural gas supply for the next 20-plus years, that's not all drilling programs. The drilling program could go in the 7- to 10-year range and then the gas production will come after that. So near term, it's going to be very consistent with 2013 expenditure. But then the gas production will go off for many years after that.","John J. Ferriola","I would just build upon that a little bit. We talked often and did again today in the script about Nucor's long-term focus on profitability and being a low-cost producer, and this is one of those projects that's obviously a long-term project, a lot of capital is being invested. But again, it's going to pay back over the long term. This is important for us. One of our strategic goals has been to be a low-cost producer of steel and have 6 million to 7 million tons of high-valued, low-residual scrap or scrap substitute products under our control. And the DRI project is critical to achieving that strategic objective. Having the natural gas project ensures the long-term viability of the DRI project, so they go hand-in-hand and both are focused on providing Nucor with a long-term return on a good investment.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question I wanted to touch upon was with respect to the DRI project that you have coming online this year. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on -- you gave us some CapEx numbers, but whether there would be sort of some start up costs that would sort of run through the income statement before you started to see the benefit, and then if you could sort of give us some color on when it starts up and when it hits full capacity this year.","James D. Frias","I'll give you part of it, and Ladd, I'll let you talk about the full capacity part of the question. Our forecast is that pre-operating and startup costs related to Louisiana will run somewhere in the neighborhood of $8 million to $9 million a quarter for the first half of the year. And after that, it should swing to a profit sometime in the third quarter with -- once it starts making product. And the timing of hitting full capacity, Ladd?","Ladd R. Hall","We're anticipating right now, as John mentioned, mid-year -- starting that up, the DRI facility, it's on a slow ramp-up. I would tell you, within 2 to 4 months, it will be at full capacity. So by the end of next year, absolutely, we'll be running at full capacity. By the end of this year, yes.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. There's been a lot of talk about residential activity picking up and it presages what will occur in the nonres side. Is there anything that you're seeing in your order book that we can sort of view as kind of a greenshoe [ph] towards a recovery in nonresidential construction?","John J. Ferriola","Well, we have seen a very modest improvement in our order entry and our backlogs going into the first quarter, and there's been some other indicators that we've seen that nonresidential construction might be seeing -- will continue its modest growth as we move through 2013. One is the ABI has been positive, being positive being above 50 now for about 5 months in a row. That's a good sign. Residential construction picking up and strengthening is also usually a precursor to nonresidential picking up. So there's a couple of things out there that we see as indicators that we will see at least a continued modest improvement in nonresidential construction through 2013. Ham, is there anything you'd like to add to that?","Hamilton Lott","John, in all 3 of the areas that we play in, we're cautiously optimistic this year. I mean, it's been a tough, tough 4 or 5 years. But cautious optimism, I think, is the right way to look at it.","John J. Ferriola","I would point out that when you look at our fabricated products businesses over the last 3 quarters, they have been profitable for 3 quarters in a row, which is -- how many quarters previous to that?","Hamilton Lott","Too many to mention.","John J. Ferriola","Okay, so it's showing a good recovery.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And one final follow-up question. With your outlook on SBQ, and the investments and so forth, if there's a slowdown in any of the drilling activity, would that impact the SBQ outlook for you at all?","John J. Ferriola","Well, it plays a role in it, but SBQ goes into many, many other markets: Automotive, big play in automotive; agricultural, a lot of our SB products go into the agricultural market and that has been strong; heavy trucks; heavy equipment. So that's one market, but it's only one of many markets that SBQ goes into. So I would not see a slowdown in drilling having a major impact on SBQ. Obviously, what happens in those other markets I mentioned will impact our SBQ markets.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Arun Viswanathan with Longbow Research.","Arun S. Viswanathan - Longbow Research LLC","So I guess you guys have appeared to be somewhat of a price leader recently with some announcements over the last couple of months. Can you just help me understand what you're seeing maybe on the lead time side, in sheet market, as well as in Long Products, that would lead you to those moves?","John J. Ferriola","Well, many things come into our pricing decisions, lead time being one of them. Obviously, there's other things that we see that will impact that also. In terms of sheet, our lead times are probably in the neighborhood of somewhere between 2 and 4 weeks, depending upon the product. When you go out into coil rolls [ph] and dowels [ph] you're probably around a 4- to 6-week lead time period. On the Long Product side, it's harder to get lead times. Obviously, we sell a lot of that off of the floor. So we don't look at lead times as such, so I really can't give you an answer on that one. Plate side, our lead times are probably in that same neighborhood. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks depending upon the product. Now, clearly, at our Hertford County mill with our heat treat side, it's been doing extremely well, the lead times are significantly longer on that. We expect the same for our normalizing line as it comes into production during the course of this year. So that gives you some indications of the lead times.","Arun S. Viswanathan - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And has that changed over the last month or so? Is it potentially -- you talk about cautious optimism, so is that because those lead times are extending in certain areas?","John J. Ferriola","It's ebbed and flowed, frankly. Over the last couple of months, it's picked up. The lead times have shortened. They've extended out. So -- but overall, we see it pretty stable. I would describe demand in the sheet market as stable. But having said that, it's been stable, but the capacity still far exceeds the supply -- the capacity far exceeds the demand that's out there in the market. So we see 2013 to be another challenging year in sheet.","James D. Frias","The commentary about cautioned optimism wasn't about the steel mill products directly, it was about the downstream Construction Products businesses, specifically, just as a clarification.","Arun S. Viswanathan - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And I guess the final question I had was just on the course of strategy, last year, you did go downstream a little bit and you have some other investments this year, maybe just help me understand what you guys are thinking next as far as any large moves. Obviously, I know about DRI and all that, but are you still contemplating any large improvements or increases in capacity or M&A or any, what do you think about that?","John J. Ferriola","I think we will continue to look at every opportunity as it becomes available. We'll assess it and we'll make the right decision.","James D. Frias","And we'll let you know when we make those decisions.","Operator","We go next to Brian Yu with Citi.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","John, when we look at your 2012 shipments of structural, you're the only one to show year-on-year increase, and I was wondering if any of that has to do with your acquisition of Skyline and being able to move your own product through? And if that's the case, how much more opportunities are there as we look out into 2013?","John J. Ferriola","Well, certainly, having Skyline as part of the Nucor family has allowed us to move product through the new family member and that's helped. I don't know if we want to comment specifically on how much more opportunity we have going through that. We like to think of our opportunities as limitless, so we encourage our new friends and new family members to continue growing their business at Skyline. And we can make a lot of product at NYS that we can ship [indiscernible] to the market.","Hamilton Lott","As we make the new [indiscernible] size...","R. Joseph Stratman","I was going to add one thing, Brian. We are adding the wider sheet piling sections at Nucor-Yamato. Those will come online, we anticipate, in the middle of next year, 2014. That will be new products for us. Those are products that the Skyline team has been distributing in the past from other suppliers and, certainly, is a net increase for the Nucor family. So that's a growth opportunity within the structural business. And we're always -- the team at Nucor-Yamato and the team at Berkeley, our 2 structural mills, are always looking at new sections. Not all of them are huge volume, but incrementally, they make nice tons in these kinds of markets. And as Jim Frias said earlier, it keeps us at higher faster utilization rates throughout all market conditions.","James D. Frias","And Joe, you may also speak to how Skyline will benefit the sheet business more this year next year?","R. Joseph Stratman","One of the product lines that Skyline has and produces is pipe piling. These are for foundation applications. This is not structural type pipe and tube, this is not OCTG pipe. These are foundation pipe piles. They produce those pipe piles. The raw material they use is a sheet coil, our light plate coil and more of those tons from Skyline will be directed to Nucor mills now that they're a member of our family. So that'll improve the overall Nucor business.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And the second question is just non-fabrication business, I think you mentioned that it is getting better in there. Can you talk about the backlog, if you can provide some perspective on what kind of growth you're seeing there? And then would that be more of an indication of demand for the bar or would you move some structural products through there, too?","John J. Ferriola","I'll just make a general statement about it. We're not going to give out any specific numbers on our backlogs. We've mentioned several times that we've seen a modest improvement and we'll leave it at that. Certainly, as that market improves, we will move more of our products through those businesses, our bar products, our structural products, all of our products. So we're anxiously awaiting to grow from modest to better.","James D. Frias","Of the 3 businesses, the deck plant, obviously, the sheet products, the joist plants are primarily bar, the rebar fab, this is all bar. But the metal building businesses uses sheet, bar and structural. So they use some of all 3.","Operator","And we go next to Timna Tanners with Bank of America.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I want to ask you, because we've all been probing a lot into getting to know what DRI is and understanding it better, one of the pushbacks I keep hearing from people is that this just sounds too good to be true. So I wanted to get from you, what can go wrong there? What would keep you up at night in your whole DRI endeavor?","John J. Ferriola","What keeps me up at night in our DRI endeavor? Well, over the last year it's been weather, okay? It's a case of too much rain or too little rain. We talked about that during the script. This is a proven technology, so I really don't have a concern about the technology itself. We've got a great team down there. We have been operating our plant in Trinidad for several years now and we've gone from starting that plant up to taking it to a world-class facility in a very short period of time. So we're experienced at DRI production. We understand the process. So frankly, there's many things that keep me up at night, but our DRI plant, the startup of our DRI plant, is not one of them.","James D. Frias","Timna, I would just add 2 comments. One is that our Trinidad DRI facility had its most profitable year this year. So even in a weak market it's doing pretty well. And in general, the comment we've made to you and a number of folks is that in weak markets, like we're seeing now, we'll make a small decent return on the DRI product, have some small cost advantages that are worthwhile. And in strong markets we'll have very, very large competitive advantages when scrap prices and pig iron prices, which typically gone extremely high will be based on this fixed cost of natural gas we've locked in plus iron ore prices which tend to not be quite as volatile.","John J. Ferriola","And you've seen some of the volatility that existed in those markets over the last year and I just want to repeat what we said several times to you, and that is that when we view the DRI investment, the purpose is to produce a low-cost, sustainable and long-term supply of a high-quality iron unit over the cycle, and that's a key statement, 'over the cycle.' When you look at just iron ore, over the last 6 months, it's gone from a low of about, what, $97, $98. And it peaked out somewhere recently at about $155 a ton. So when you have those kinds of swings, that impacts all of our raw materials. Clearly, there's a correlation between iron ore pricing and pig iron pricing and even the scrap prices. So this provides for us a long-term supply over the cycle of low-cost, high-quality scrap substitute products for our mills.","R. Joseph Stratman","And Timna, let me add one more thing. As you know in your research, you said you've been studying DRI and you go back to the history of DRI in this country, you'll see that it's been a successful technology, but the one thing that it failed at over the decades is controlling the natural gas price. That's what drove the original DRI plants to their demise and that's one of the key elements of the whole DRI plant.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then so from high-level to a more granular question, I wanted to go into a little bit about what you said about the first quarter. We have been, here in first quarter, surprisingly weak to start the year, but your guidance of kind of a flattish outlook in terms of operations, particularly, even a little surprising considering that you had the worst quarter in a couple of years in both plate and bars. So can you just give us a little bit more color? Is this something that you think is somewhat temporary? Is it weather or the election or the fiscal cliff or is it something more onerous in terms of potential weak volume levels?","John J. Ferriola","I would answer by saying all of the above, okay? The economy is still struggling. We talked about the things that are influencing our business. You mentioned the fiscal cliff. Certainly, consumer confidence remains at a very low level. There's a lot of issues that are still out there in the economy. And you also have the issue that we mentioned of imports. There's a continuing surge of unfairly traded imports that needs to be dealt with. So all of those are factors that we have rolled into our forecast and said, based on all that, we think that the business will be stable and our operations will be consistent into the first quarter. I don't want to get into any breakdown product by product.","Operator","We go next to Dave Galison with CIBC World Markets.","David Galison - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","So just -- now that you're heading into the ramp-up for the DRI facility, can you talk a bit about the next stages for your raw material strategy, and how we should think about the expansion to the 6 million and 7 million tons of scrap substitute?","John J. Ferriola","Well, first things first, David. We want to start up the existing one and get it running. And then once we have it up and running, as we said, we'll start up in the middle of the year, we should be up to full production sometime by the end of the year. Once we accomplish that, we'll take a look at where things stand, how well that's performing, what we've learned and we'll take a look at the market at that time, the economy at that time. Based on what we see, we'll make a decision on how we move forward.","David Galison - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","And would it be a little bit longer timeframe, maybe another year, a couple of years, before you expand into that on level?","John J. Ferriola","Again, I'm not going to give a specific timeframe because we have to take a look at what the environment looks like as we make that decision at the end of next year. But we built the facility in Louisiana with the infrastructure to support a second DRI unit. So that should give you some indication of our thinking.","Hamilton Lott","And we will have 4.5 million of the 6 million to 7 million tons established so we've made significant progress with the second DRI facility towards our goal. There isn't a lot of pressure that we have to immediately do one right away. Like John said, there'll be a numbers factors that affect the decision.","David Galison - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just a housekeeping question on the tax rate. Is there -- it was a bit lower in this quarter. Was there anything unusual there that brought it down?","James D. Frias","Nothing too dramatic. There was some state long-term liabilities from 2008 that fell off as new ones went on and profits were bigger in '08 than they were in '12, so the flip of those things creates a small benefit in the quarter, but it wasn't, it might be $6 million or $7 million, somewhere in that range.","Operator","And we go next to Richard Garchitorena with Credit Suisse.","Richard Garchitorena - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So my first question, just wanted to follow up on the questions on the projects, SBQ expansions at Berkeley. I know you can't give us margin expectations, but is there any way you can quantify the timing of when those are going to come on through 2013? Are they going to be more back half of the year or spread out throughout the year?","John J. Ferriola","Well, there's different timelines for the different projects that we have. Suffice it to say that most of them will be coming online during 2013. We might have 1 or 2 that will move into the first and second quarter of '14. Jim, is there anything you want to add to that?","James R. Darsey","John, that's basically it. We've got the projects in Memphis, Nebraska and Arlington and they're spread out projects affecting different areas of the operation. Some will be on as early as midyear this year, some in the fall of '13 and then some spill over into midyear of 2014.","Richard Garchitorena - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my other question was just on nonres again. Obviously, we've seen some small improvement, but I guess, can you tell us what you think about when that turns, how is that going to be broken down between commercial construction and infrastructure, given the fact that government spending probably has not returned and probably will not return as quickly as to the rest of nonres, and obviously, residential construction has led the way. So how do you think about that going forward?","John J. Ferriola","Let me make sure I understand the question. You're asking how we view infrastructure builds versus other forms of nonresidential construction?","Richard Garchitorena - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Which market do you think will come back first and how is that going to impact Nucor?","John J. Ferriola","Well, infrastructure might be slower in coming back, simply because of government spending. That said, when you look at the condition of our infrastructure, it's in very poor shape. So sooner or later, the government's going to have to make a decision to repair the damaged infrastructure of our country. So sooner or later, we will see a build, a return in infrastructure. When that's going to occur, I really can't say. On the nonresidential construction side, as we said, it's growing slowly. Our best guess would probably be maybe 2 more years of slow growth before we saw any significant improvement.","James R. Darsey","Every time we predict that it's starting better, it slows down again. So again, we think it's going to be better this year, but there's just not a lot of signs out there. The most encouraging thing is all the talk about manufacturing returning to the United States. That will be as big as anything in helping the nonres construction.","John J. Ferriola","And as we've said several times today, our focus at Nucor is always the long term. So whether it returns this year or next year, we continue to prepare for it, invest in our company and in our facilities so that we're ready for it when it does come. Inevitably it's going to return. Inevitably, the economy will improve. Inevitably, our markets will improve. Inevitably, nonresidential construction will improve and infrastructure builds will improve. It's just a question of time.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mark Parr with KeyBanc.","Mark L. Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I have -- this is kind of a high-level thought, but if you think about all the new iron units that are currently in process, you've got you guys in Louisiana, you've got this Magnetation thing going on up in Minnesota. You've got Mittel [ph] increasing taconite production, U.S. Steel increasing taconite production, how do you reconcile all that in a North American steel market that's not growing a whole heck of a lot? I'd just be interested in your thoughts about that.","John J. Ferriola","Remember that iron units move global, so you've got to look at the global steel market and certainly, right now, that isn't the greatest either. When you look at the long-term drivers and the dynamics of the global market, we continue to believe it's going to improve and be strong. And we always refer to it as the super cycles of steel and steel commodities. You've got still a lot of developing countries out there that are moving into the middle-class with fairly low steel intensities today that will improve. Over the course of the long-term cycle, globally, steel demand will still be strong. That will necessitate a strong demand for the commodities, the raw materials that go into it. So we look at it, again, in terms of a long-term cycle for steel demand and for the demand commodities. We don't look at it regionally in North America.","Mark L. Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, so...","John J. Ferriola","A great example of that would be to take a look at how much scrap has been exported out of the country this year alone and it's going to be something that -- 2012, I think, will come in at about 23 million tons of scrap exported out of the United States, and that's going to continue. And I would add to that, especially given some of the countries today and the rules that they are imposing upon the exportation of their raw materials, particularly scrap. There's been a number of countries that have recently imposed tariffs or have outright banned the exportation of scrap. So as you have those dynamics come into play, there's going to be long-term continued demand for iron units of all types. We believe that and that's why we continue to invest in them.","Mark L. Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just one other question, if I could, is there -- I mean, do you have any thoughts about, if you're going to have a positive surprise on shipments in the first quarter, where do you think it might come from? And likewise, if you were going to have a negative surprise in shipments, where do you think that would come from?","John J. Ferriola","Well, I guess the positive surprise in shipments would come if we had a very, very surprising improvement in the economy...","Mark L. Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Any particular end markets, though? I mean, I wasn't trying to -- I was trying to be a little more specific.","John J. Ferriola","Well, we've talked about the ones that remained strong and of course, that means that there are some that are weak. So if automotive, energy, infrastructure -- excuse me, agricultural would suddenly slowdown, that could have a negative impact upon our business or if some of the ones that we mentioned are slowly but modestly improving take off wildly, it could have a positive impact on our business. So it really depends upon what happens in the economy. We aren't expecting any surprises. And hopefully, if we get any, they'll be the positive type.","Operator","And we go next to Tony Rizzuto with Dahlman Rose.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","I've got a couple of questions here. It's been some time since you guys have broken out your key end markets. And now with growing auto and a lot of your acquisitions investments, I was wondering if you could take a stab at it, if you could share it with us, where you see how big auto is, construction, oil and gas, all those different markets for us, that's one of my questions.","John J. Ferriola","Well, I don't know that we want to give specifics on that. We might talk about some of the areas that we've grown in. We've mentioned during the call that automotive has been a focus for us and we've grown in that. I'm not going to give out any specific tonnages. But I will say that, as I mentioned, we grew 20% in that market. The markets that you mentioned are all strong markets for us, obviously, pipe and tube, gas industry's strong, all the ones that you mentioned. I don't think we want to get into giving specific market shares or a breakdown of what percentage of our products go into the individual markets.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","It'd more or less, from a revenue standpoint, that's what I'm trying to get at. And I used to think about Nucor being maybe closer to 60% or 65% construction. My feeling is it's probably maybe a little bit less today, but that's where I'm kind of going with this.","John J. Ferriola","That's it. If you're looking at it from that macro view, we could make that comment and we would agree with you that over the last 5 years, we have worked hard and invested to shift more into the value-added products and we always make sure that as we do that, we don't abandon any of the markets that we play in, so we stay strong in the commodity markets, as we have continued to invest and grow into the value-added markets. In terms of general construction versus more manufactured products, maybe 65%, 70% of revenue.","James D. Frias","Yes, the only thing I'd say is we do publish statistics about how much we make in each of the subproduct categories: Sheet, plate, structural. So if you take a look at that data, we're the largest U.S. steel producer and we've got the broadest product offering. So generally, whatever the U.S. demand for steel products is, we're going to mirror it fairly closely because we pretty much make all the products.","John J. Ferriola","And participate in all the markets.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's fine. And in terms of scrap, just your thoughts here, obviously, we're hearing that the scrap busheling for February could be down maybe $10, $20 per long ton. And I was wondering how you feel about the markets, how you see it playing out? If you can make any comments on that, it'd be very helpful.","John J. Ferriola","Well, I asked Mr. Grass about it before the call and he told me that if the market does not go up and the market does not go down, then there's 100% chance it's going to go sideways. I don't know if that helps you, Tony.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","All right. 100% chance that it's going to go sideways, all right. Well, that's really helpful.","John J. Ferriola","If it doesn't go up and if it doesn't go down. Yes, let me make a general comment. It's a very regional business and in this particular season, more than in the past, we've had a lot of strange weather that's occurred regionally so there's a lot of different impacts on different regions of the country. Overall, as we look going forward, we see it not changing significantly from where it is today. So it's going to stay within a band, at least for the next month.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. And the final question I have is, when is the right time for Nucor to buy iron ore assets? Are you of the view that iron ore is going to find its way ultimately down to that kind of $80 to $100 per metric ton level? How do you see it and what's your thought process there, John?","John J. Ferriola","It's the same as Dan has said many times. We continue to look at every opportunity that's out there. When we find the right opportunity, if we find the right opportunity, we'll act. If we don't, we won't.","Operator","And we go next to Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, just wanted to understand your CapEx sort of program for the next couple of years. It looks like most of these projects are going to be winding down this year. The DRI, the SBQ, probably Nucor-Yamato sheet piling may extend into '14 and it looks like the lighter gauge in South Carolina mill will also wind down. So I just want to understand how do we look at it, and of course, natural gas, $260 million per year, looks like is going to continue. But how should we think about CapEx sort of '14 and beyond, either you or Jim can take a stab at it, please?","James D. Frias","Sal, I'd say that based on what we know today, our expectation is that '13 will be a peak year for CapEx and it will wind down some in '14. But quite honestly, the way we're constantly working on strategic opportunities, I'd hate to limit it and say, it couldn't be a $1 billion again. I would say that what we know today would say it's probably in the $600 million to $700 million range in 2014. And for us, that's a long way to think out about specific CapEx numbers and we've talked about this before. We have a strategic planning meeting offsite every year in August. And after August, we get a better feel for what's going to happen 2 years out to 5 years out. And I don't know if we'll be willing to add color after that point in time, we probably won't, because we like to keep our cards close to the chest. But I would say, right now, our expectation is '14's down and who can even imagine after '14.","John J. Ferriola","And the only thing I would add to that, Jim, is we are constantly looking for the right opportunities. Given our strong balance sheet, we're able to act on those opportunities when they become available. We've got a great mergers and acquisition team that are constantly evaluating opportunities. If the right ones come along, we'll act on them. And we have the balance sheet to do it, and we'll do it. So I don't want to limit any comments as to what capital would look like in '14. That will depend entirely upon what opportunities are in front of us at that time.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I have a question on the pellets supply. I know you're buying pellets for your plant at the moment, iron ore pellets, from Brazil and you continue to -- I think you planned [indiscernible] are beginning to buy from Brazil or -- I think Brazil, I believe, that's what Dan said in the past. And I was wondering have you looked at the supplier from the northern part, in Minnesota area or Canada, and does it make sense for you to look at that in terms of freight costs and quality over time that you can source your raw materials also within the continent rather than going out of here?","John J. Ferriola","Just to help your memory, Dan has mentioned several times that we actually get them from 3 different suppliers, 2 of which are in Brazil and 1 of which is in Canada.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And have you looked at other sources?","John J. Ferriola","Absolutely. We look not only in Canada for other sources and in Brazil for other sources, but frankly, we scour the world for the right pellet and iron ore feedstock and we found some interesting opportunities in some strange places and we'll continue to pursue those.","Operator","And we go next to Michelle Applebaum with Steel Market Intelligence.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","I have a follow-up question. So I wanted to ask, you guys started talking about a new style of enforcement, a trade kind of thing, and I'm sure you've noticed that a number of our trading partners, particularly in Latin America, in Asia and Europe, have all been kind of putting up, making a lot of noise about some trade enforcement in their regions. And I was just wondering if you could give us an update on what's happening with that, in terms of new and creative out-of-the-box types of things.","John J. Ferriola","Well, I'm not going to give any specifics. We want to keep them as surprises. We don't want to give away our strategy. But I'll make a general statement and the focus will be on a more proactive approach. That's what we need in this country and we're going to pursue that as we move forward. Obviously, the way that it's worked in the past, the way that it's worked in the past has been a very reactive program. We take action after the damage is done, after steel companies are put out of business, after American workers lose their jobs. Our approach will be much more proactive. And I'm not going to say much more than that, other than to say that we're addressing that issue every day with our government. As mentioned during the script, Dan DiMicco is going to remain focused on that and I've got great confidence in his ability to get it done.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions on our roster. Therefore, Mr. Ferriola, I will turn the conference back over to you for any closing remarks.","John J. Ferriola","Thank you. I'd like to close by saying thank you for your interest in our company. And I'd like to say thank you to our 22,000 teammates for working safe, for working hard, for working smart and working together.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will come at that time.","Certain statements made during this conference will be forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The words we expect, believe, anticipate and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify those forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and information that is currently available.

The forward-looking statements made in this conference call speak only as of this date, and Nucor does not assume any obligation to update them either as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Ferriola, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Nucor Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. We appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today\u2019s call are the other members of Nucor\u2019s senior management team: Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other Executive Vice Presidents; Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman, Dave Sumoski, and Chad Utermark.","In addition to his leadership of our raw material business, Joe Stratman has recently taken on additional responsibilities as Nucor\u2019s Chief Digital Officer. Joe\u2019s assignment is to lead the development and implementation of an enterprise-wide information system to collect, analyze and distribute commercial, financial and management data. The objectives are two-fold, to drive continual improvement in our decision making and to provide our customers with world-class business-to-business tools and increase the overall value proposition Nucor provides them. ","Our leadership team in Charlotte would like to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit, Steel Technologies, and Skyline Steel teams for working together to build a safer, stronger and more profitable Nucor. You are the reason, our Company is thriving in theses challenging steel market conditions and will continue to thrive in the years ahead. Thank you.","Our teammates at Duferdofin-Nucor, our long product steel making joint venture in Italy, provide a great example of how we respond to adverse market conditions, leveraging significant improvements in costs and product mix. They have increased volume and market share in a very challenging and oversupplied European long product markets. As a result, the Duferdofin-Nucor team has achieved positive EBITDA for the past 12 consecutive months and a positive operating profit for the last four months. They should feel very proud of their accomplishment as they continue their unrelenting drive for continual improvement and a brighter future. We\u2019re very grateful to have them as members of the Nucor team.","We also want to extend a very warm welcome to the newest members of the Nucor family. Our Nucor Steel Longview team at our recently acquired specialty plate mill in Texas. Nucor is very proud and very excited to have you on-board.","Our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias, will now review Nucor\u2019s third quarter performance and financial position. Following those comments, I will update you on the execution of our strategy for long-term profitable growth. Jim?","Jim Frias","Thanks, John. Third quarter of 2016 earnings of $0.84 per diluted share were just below our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.90 per diluted share. However, relative to our guidance, our third quarter results included a larger than expected LIFO charge that decreased our quarterly earnings by $0.08 per diluted share. Third quarter earnings were also reduced by approximately $0.04 per diluted share, the net impact of onetime items. These included expenses for settlement of legal issues as well as a net gain related to asset valuation adjustments.","The improvement in earnings in the third quarter compared to the second quarter was due to improved performance at our sheet mills and our direct reduced iron or DRI raw materials facilities. The sheet mills experienced improved margins under contract sales, which are priced on a lag basis. The DRI plants experienced improved transfer pricing of the DRI they sold during the quarter to our steel mills.","Overall market conditions were very challenging during the third quarter. That was clearly evidenced by a decline in our steel mills segment\u2019s capacity utilization rate to 71% in the third quarter from 83% in the second quarter. Third quarter total steel mill tons shipped decreased by 12% from the second quarter 2016.","Our tax rate can be confusing due to the impact of profits from non-controlling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was approximately 32.8% for the third quarter and 32.9% for the first nine months of 2016. Nucor\u2019s financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 35% at the close of the third quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $2.3 billion, which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Nucor\u2019s strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until April 2021. Nucor holds the highest credit ratings of any North American headquartered steel producer.","During the third quarter, we restructured our natural gas supply agreements with Encana. Low cost natural gas is critical to the long-term success of Nucor\u2019s raw material strategy. The restructuring ensures that our Louisiana DRI plant has a secure and low cost supply of natural gas for decades into the future. In turn, DRI gives Nucor the flexibility to optimize the mix and most importantly, our metallic input costs. Iron units represent more than half of the total costs of our steel making operations. Just as important, a secure and low cost supply of high-quality iron units such as DRI, supports our growth strategy of moving up to value chain into more demanding steel applications. We expect constraints in supply and cost of higher quality scrap to grow in the years ahead.","Here is a recap of the major elements of the restructuring.","Nucor purchased 49% of Encana\u2019s leasehold interest covering approximately 54,000 acres in the South Piceance Basin, Nucor and Encana terminated two Carry and Earning drilling agreements entered into in 2010 and 2012. Nucor also sold to Encana its 50% equity interest in Hunter Ridge gas gathering and processing assets located in the North Piceance Basin. The benefits of the new structure are significant; I will outline the top four. ","First, the leasehold interest provides Nucor full discretion on its participation in all future capital investments; our decision to invest in any drilling is independent of other leasehold partners. Second by canceling the Carry and Earning drilling agreements, Nucor has eliminated all future Carry cost premiums and contingent liabilities associated with these contracts; that improves Nucor\u2019s capital flexibility and should result in lower future drilling costs. Three, Nucor owns a tangible asset, the acreage interest rather than contractual rights. Four, Nucor\u2019s acreage interest is expected to be able to meet the current gas usage for all of our steel mills and our DRI facility in Louisiana for decades into the future. The net result of these transactions is a lower cost and more flexible hedge against higher natural gas costs for our Louisiana DRI facility and our core steel making operations.","Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 are expected to decrease notably compared to the third quarter. The two most significant challenges are expected to be downward contract pricing resets at our sheet mills and the impact of lower iron units pricing at our raw materials segment. Beyond these near-term issues, we see a number of positive factors that should benefit the steel markets moving into 2017. Steel service center inventories are low, residential construction is robust, while non-residential construction activity is expected to continue its slow but steady pace of improvement. Trends in U.S. employment and consumer spending remain healthy. More vigorous enforcement of trade laws has began to reduce the flow of illegally traded imports into the U.S.","We are confident that Nucor\u2019s significant competitive advantages and highly flexible business model will allow our team to continue to execute on our proven strategies for delivering profitable long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor shareholders.","Thank you for your interest in our Company. John?","John Ferriola","Thanks, Jim. Nucor\u2019s strategy for profitable growth is working. We can see the payoff even in the challenging markets of the current prolonged downturn. It is evident in our strong cash flow generation and our industry-leading returns on capital. Most importantly, it is positioning Nucor to deliver higher highs and profitability during the inevitable cyclical upturn.","We\u2019re executing our long-term growth strategy by leveraging Nucor\u2019s five drivers to profitable growth. The five drivers are: One, strengthen our position as a low cost producer; Two, achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio; Three, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher quality, higher margin products; Four, expand and leverage our downstream channels to the market to increase our steel mills base load volume, especially in weak markets; Five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength.","I will now update you on highlights of the recent progress implementing our strategy for profitable growth. In August, we completed the acquisition of Joy Global\u2019s steel plate mill in Longview, Texas for approximately $29 million. Annual melting capacity is 180,000 tons. The mill produces specialty plate products, ranging from 1 to 12 inches thick and up to 138 inches wide. That expands Nucor\u2019s plate product portfolio, as the capabilities of our North Carolina and Alabama plate mills reach up to 3 inches thick and 120 inches wide. Customer interest in our broaden plate offerings is very strong.","Nucor Steel Longview is booking orders at levels exceeding our expectations. The mill has already doubled its production rate since completion of the acquisition. We are very excited about the opportunities for profitable, long-term growth Nucor Steel Longview offers our plate business.","In September, we announced an agreement to acquire Independence Tube Corporation. Independence Tube is the second largest U.S. producer of hollow structural section or HSS steel tubing. Annual production is about 600,000 tons from four facilities in Illinois and Alabama. HSS steel tubing is predominantly used in non-residential construction. The purchase price is $435 million, or approximately six times average EBITDA over the 2013 to 2015 period.","Independence Tube is a natural fit with Nucor and our strategy for profitable growth. Our companies\u2019 cultures are very similar, sharing key values such as continual improvement, pay for performance, and the way we value our team members. Two other very important criteria we apply in evaluating acquisition opportunities are being a low cost producer and holding a market leadership position. And like Nucor, they operate efficient manufacturing facilities with a highly variable cost structure. Independence Tube will also be a value-added channel to market the Nucor\u2019s hot-rolled sheet steel. It\u2019s worth noting that the Independence Tube plants are located in close proximity to Nucor\u2019s sheet mills in Alabama, Indiana and Kentucky.","Nucor is already North America\u2019s most comprehensive supplier of steel solutions to the construction and infrastructure markets. We hold leadership positions in beams, bar, plate, steel edge piling and pipe piling manufacturing and distribution, as well as joist, decking, metal buildings and rebar fabrication. The addition of HSS steel tubing to our product portfolio will further differentiate Nucor from our steel competitors in our ability to take care of our customers. We are looking forward to welcoming the Independence Tube team to the Nucor family, as our newest growth platform. Closing of this acquisition is expected around the end of October.","A second major growth initiative was announced in September. Plans to build a specialty cold-rolling complex at our Arkansas sheet steel mill. This facility will cost an estimated $230 million. It is expected to be operational in about two years. Annual capacity would be approximately 500,000 tons. This investment supports our strategy of moving up the value chain and growing our participation in the automotive market.","The Arkansas Specialty Cold Mill Complex will expand our sheet mill group\u2019s capabilities to include products that we are currently unable to manufacture. The flexible cold mill reduction mill will allow us to cold reduce to both lighter gauge and much higher strength levels, to meet our customers\u2019 light weighting goals. The upgraded batch anneal shop will include the ultra-high temperature capability required from production of motor lamination steels with electrical properties previously only obtainable by non-oriented silicon steels. The Specialty Cold Mill Complex will also broaden the automotive capability of our galvanizing lines at our Alabama and South Carolina sheet mills.","Our Nucor-Yamato structural steel mill team is on track with the expansion of their value-added product offerings. Shipments of the recently introduced wider sheet piling sections have increased two and a half folds through the first nine months of 2016 compared to the year ago period. Two of the four new sections have been commercialized with the remaining two sections to be commissioned by the end of the first quarter of 2017.","Nucor-Yamato has also begun trial production of its new high-strength, low-alloy beams utilizing the recently installed Quench and Self-Tempering technology. We expect to complete trials across the entire range of these ASTM Grade A913 structural sections during the first half of 2017. Nucor-Yamato will be the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams.","Nucor\u2019s SBQ bar mill group achieved significant new value-added product milestones in the third quarter. Our Memphis SBQ Mill shipped its first annealed and quench and tampered bars utilizing the heat treating equipment installed earlier this year. With this new value-added capability, Memphis aims to grow its participation in a number of markets including energy, agriculture and mining. Our Nebraska SBQ mill started up its new coil conveyor system that yields significant quality improvements. This will allow Nebraska to move up the value chain in coil applications for such markets as automotive fasteners, and oil and gas. These are just some of the exciting initiatives being taken throughout Nucor to drive profitable growth.","Let me conclude with some comments on the greatest challenge facing the steel industry, global steel overcapacity resulting from the trade distorting practices of some governments. The message is simple, significant progress is being made. But there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done. The recent affirmative final determinations in the three flat-rolled steel antidumping duty and countervailing duty cases were an important step forward. However, many of the products require trade enforcement action, including pending cases, addressing illegally traded imports of rebar and cut-to-length plate. At the same time, decisive action is needed to deal with efforts by foreign producers to circumvent duties by routing products through third-party countries. One notable example is China\u2019s circumventing cold-rolled and coated flat-rolled steel duties by shipping product through Vietnam.","Nucor embraces free and fair competition. With our conscious focus on continual improvement and technological innovation, Nucor thrives in a marketplace where winners are determined by real economic advantage, not advantages derived by artificial or illegal means. For this reason, Nucor will continue to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing effective and timely enforcement of our nation\u2019s trade laws. We owe nothing less than that to our customers, our employees and our shareholders. Challenges clearly remain for the global steel industry but for a company such as Nucor, one that is in the unique position of strength and has a proven ability to execute its strategy for profitable growth, these are also times of great opportunity. That is why I\u2019m absolutely confident that Nucor\u2019s best years are still ahead of us.","We would now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Ferriola. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Matthew Korn with Barclays.","Matthew Korn","So, looking and understanding your expectations for the fourth quarter, as you laid out in this morning\u2019s release, how would you characterize just today, your inbound orders rates versus say two weeks ago or even last month? Are there any signs of buyers\u2019 appetites increasing or their willingness to pay higher prices starting to merge even on the margin?","John Ferriola","If you look at the order entry rate, particularly in our sheet products over the last couple of weeks, we have seen an uptick. This was not unexpected. It\u2019s a typical annual order entry trend -- patterns that we see. Towards the end of the third quarter, towards the middle of the third quarter, you start seeing order entry slack, people beginning to look at year-end inventories. This year when you look at the third quarter and people saw scrap pricing starting to decline and also close and to slow down on their order entry rates. But then as they get into the latter part of the third quarter, the end of the quarter, as we go into the beginning of the fourth quarter, we would expect -- we see order entry rate picking up in anticipation of receiving the tonnage in the beginning of the New Year.","Matthew Korn","Let me ask then, you\u2019ve been very active on the M&A and on the investment front, as you went over. Should we expect more from you as we look over the next six months, has this -- the current price declined in steel; is that dislodge [ph] of the assets that you\u2019ve been interested in? And barring that what would be your sense the potential for any substantial buyback or a lift in the dividend? Thanks.","John Ferriola","As we always say, we don\u2019t comment on anything specific but clearly, our financial position is very strong, our cash generation from operations is very strong. We have the ability to go after targets that we think will bring long-term profitable growth to our Company and a great return to our shareholders. So, we are always on the lookout for opportunities. And then, of course as we\u2019ve said many times in the past, if we don\u2019t see any opportunities that are out there that we think will brining value to our Company and we have an excess of cash on hand, we\u2019ll always look at -- we look at the possibility of share back buyback or in one form or another returning cash to our shareholders. But of course our first priority is always long-term profitable growth through investment when the opportunities present themselves.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse.","Curt Woodworth","John, when you look at your volume performance in the sheet mill this quarter, it was fairly similar from utilization rate basis as last quarter -- I\u2019m sorry, a year ago quarter when you were facing pretty severe import pressure as well as a relatively choppy non-res market. Today, you have the greatest [ph] victory as you\u2019ve got non-res improving, auto\u2019s relatively more resilient, and you have the fact a lot of the U.S. blast furnaces have ceded a fair amount of hot band market share to the EAF. So, I\u2019m just curious what is your take on that? And I guess from a macros basis, what do you see maybe is particularly weaker than you thought at the exit of last quarter?","John Ferriola","Let me start by making a few comments on your question. When we look at automotive, we see it just about the same as last year; we don\u2019t see it significantly better. In terms of non-residential construction, we really don\u2019t see it much more improved than last year. In fact, if you go through the course of the year, particularly towards the middle of 2016, there was actually a decrease in the activity on non-residential construction. So, we don\u2019t see much of a pop from that side either. And although we have been very successful in our trade cases, particularly on sheet, we\u2019re really just beginning to see the impact of that. And frankly we do see imports going down but still they represent a very large portion of total market share that\u2019s why we continue to fight the battle and we will continue to fight and be successful in the battle against illegal imports. So, we are just beginning to see some of that impact.","But let me address another point of the capacity utilization, particularly as it applies here at Nucor. We\u2019ve talked many times about our commitment to pursuing higher value products and we are going to continue to do that. We believe that having improved margins, and profitability is more important than utilization. And as we\u2019ve said in the past, as you move, as you change your product mix to those higher valued, higher quality products that usually has an impact on your run rates in the mills. A great example would be the wide-wide projects at our Berkeley facility or the wider piling sections at our Nucor- Yamato facility. Both of those have reduced the run rate significantly although at much more profitable products.","So, we don\u2019t get so hung-up on utilization. We\u2019ve mentioned on the last call and I\u2019ll mention it again that we intend to at the end of the year, take a hard look at how our product mix has shifted over the last several years. It\u2019s been forever since we adjusted the denominator in this calculation. And we\u2019re going to take a hard look at how a product mix shift has impacted our capacity and as a result influenced our capacity utilization. So, that\u2019s how I would answer your question. We\u2019re looking more at the products that we\u2019re producing and we feel good about the way that we\u2019re that shifting our product mix.","Curt Woodworth","And then, just with respect to trade and the Vietnam petition, it seems like there\u2019s a problem of view that processing or cold-rolling material in Vietnam doesn\u2019t fundamentally change the nature -- or does fundamentally change what the product is. Can you just kind of comment on the nuance of that and how you think the Department of Commerce is going to treat that issue specifically?","John Ferriola","I\u2019m not going to go into too much detail as this is an ongoing investigation and has not done a final determination on this. We feel strongly, very strongly that our opposition is a strong one, it\u2019s clear to us. Our opinion is it\u2019s clearly an issue of circumvention. You can look at the percentage of imports of cold-rolled products from China into Vietnam and seen a tremendous jump over the last six months. It\u2019s clear what\u2019s going on. And we think that particularly when you look at the political environment today where on both sides of the aisle, there\u2019s a recognition of what\u2019s going on around the world with illegal trade. I feel and our team feels very confident that we\u2019ll be successful this circumvention case.","Operator","And your next question is from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.","Jorge Beristain","Maybe, John, if you could comment about the current pricing that you\u2019re seeing in -- sorry, in the heavy plate market. We just noticed that plate prices have fallen and are basically now below HRC and you\u2019ve recently announced the price hikes. So, if you could just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in that market? That\u2019s my first question.","John Ferriola","Well, let me -- I\u2019ll start off and I\u2019ll hand over to Chad, Executive Vice President, In-charge of our plate business. But just as a general comment, obviously, we\u2019re not going to speak about any pricing specific, but the plate market has been very challenging. It\u2019s had a tough year on plate, it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s getting much better towards the end of the year. We can go market-by-market but there\u2019s no small market right now that we would point to say that we\u2019re going to see a big pop in price. I would make one comment and then Chad you can build on this. When you look at the pricing levels in place today, personally I feel that it\u2019s just not sustainable over the long term. Chad, would you like to add anything to that.","Chad Utermark","Thanks, John. I agree, the plate market is very challenged currently. Your assessment of where plate prices are compared to hot-rolled is true that being below hot-rolled prices which they are now according to CRU is something that we have rarely seen over the history of pricing. So, I do not believe that\u2019s sustainable long term. There\u2019s some fundamental demand, challenges out there in the plate market right now. And we did announce recently a plate price increase that was the late last week and we\u2019re monitoring that situation at this time.","John Ferriola","I just might mention too Chad that we didn\u2019t have a successful plate trade case against a violator who was dumping a significant amount of plate into the country and that was China. And we had a very positive outcome on that case.","Chad Utermark","Yes. And there is a very important date coming up in November where we will get the AD rulings from commerce on the remaining eight countries. So, those are some of the things that we\u2019re monitoring closely in the plate market.","Jorge Beristain","Great. And sorry, I had a second question if possible. Just the housekeeping on Independence Tube, would you be segmenting that under your steel products or your structural steel tube segment, which is kind of that\u2019s how your steel mill segment, just to try and understand, sort of how you view that operation in terms of value add?","John Ferriola","Jim.","Jim Darsey","Right now, we\u2019re probably going put it in steel products. We haven\u2019t made a final determination, but we\u2019re thinking it belongs to steel products.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners","In light of the fact that met coal is all of a sudden back to the region that you I think started to invest in DRI. I wanted to get a sense of if we were to believe that scrap moves with met, are we looking at it again returning to that advantage that you are hoping for in DRI and how\u2019re you thinking about what heads that might offer you in a strong met coal environment into 2017?","John Ferriola","Well, clearly there are several things that scrap price tends to be linked to, certainly, one of the most important is volume. And as the mill business picks up, people have greater demand for scarp, price for scrap goes up. There is also a linkage, as you mentioned to coking coal. And we expect to see some small increase as a result of that. But, as we see scrap right now, scrap is at a pretty low number, we think it\u2019s probably at the bottom. As we look out for the rest of the year, we might see a small incremental increase but nothing substantial. Joe, anything you want to add to that?","Joe Stratman","No, I think you really covered it, John. As we head into the winter, there is always going to be a seasonality issue or potential on scrap a flow, northern scrap yards need to close down or slow down et cetera. But any strength that gives us just probably just seasonal, and ultimately it will follow the demand of the steel mills.","John Ferriola","I will take it away scrap for a minute and say that as you look at what\u2019s going to happen as these companies are going into next year\u2019s contract for buying coking coal, we believe that there will be an increase based upon the current spot buy. And obviously on final product, we see that that\u2019s going to put us in a more competitive position then we were when coking coal was at half the price that it\u2019s today.","Timna Tanners","Right. And DRI versus pig iron, same story, maybe a little more explicit connection to the met coal price?","Joe Stratman","Yes. Timna, this is Joe Stratman. Clearly that\u2019s true. I mean, obviously one of the major cost components of either pig iron or DRI is what form of reductant do you use and what reductant that -- what cost that reductant is at. So, you compare the cost of coking coal as your reductant in a pig iron environment versus natural gas and the DRI environment, you can clearly see some cost differential depending on where those two commodities are moving.","John Ferriola","Timna, if I could just add something quickly and that is this is exactly why we move forward with the DRI strategy. We look at it as we\u2019ve talked about many times just as a hedge. It gives us a flexibility, gives us balance and as cost of raw materials change, cost of raw materials and steel making represent more than 50% of the cost of the product, this gives us a tremendous advantage as things shift. And given, our DRI and our DJ Joseph Company, the ability to buy pig iron or HB iron when it makes sense, DRI facilities to be able to buy scrap internationally. These are the kinds of things when you have these kinds of movements as we\u2019ve seen today in coking coal and really point to the value of our long-term raw material strategy.","Timna Tanners","Sure. That\u2019s why we asked about it because we are back to those nickel prices [Multiple Speakers]. Okay, alright. I\u2019ll ask the tougher question now. Sorry. So, I know you talked about -- or I guess I\u2019ll ask about Big River I guess to ask a tougher question. By the end of the year, we\u2019re expecting Big River volumes to come on that is little bit in your geographic sweet spot. I know that Nucor has been moving away from commodity steels and to more value add products. But can you give us a little bit more color on how you are thinking about the arrival of Big River values -- volume and what that means for Nucor?","John Ferriola","It\u2019s another competitor and we\u2019ve never shied away from competition as well as long it\u2019s fair and legal, we love it. And we\u2019re confident that we can take it on without having an impact upon our business. Certainly, it\u2019s going to hurt the market; certainly, it is going to have an influence on the market. But given what we\u2019ve been doing, particularly in the southeast and then markets that we have been targeting, as we move up the value chain, certainly it\u2019s going to be a while before they can move up into the same areas that -- products that we are producing, particularly the high strengths, franchise [ph] strengths and the automotive kind of markets that we are moving into.","So, you\u2019re right, as we move away from -- more and more away from these more commodity grades, we\u2019ll have less of an impact. I\u2019ll also point out to you, Timna, you heard in our script about our Specialty Cold Mill Complex that\u2019s going into Hickman might point out the difference, I don\u2019t know how many miles but not that many miles away from Big River steel. And we are confident that unique mill equipment that we are putting in there, it\u2019s going to give us an ability to produce products that we can\u2019t produce today but products that certainly Big River can\u2019t produce today, and we think that that will give us another edge over them as they come up with their more commoditized products.","Timna Tanners","Okay, great. And if I could slip on last one on that same thing, I mean if we expect let\u2019s say hypothetically autos is flat going forward from here is our case we made that Nucor could continue to increase its share there and can you quantify that?","John Ferriola","Listen, we are very confident. We first of all -- just to comment on your statement, we agree. We think that going into 2017, orders will be basically flat, we don\u2019t see it going up, it might go down a little bit but we don\u2019t see it changing significantly. And even in that environment, we will continue to grow our market share, not only in the types of products that we can produce that go into automotive but frankly in the number of automotive companies that have interest in doing business with us. As we\u2019ve said many times, our target is to reach 2 million tons by 2018; today we are somewhere around 1.4, 1.45 in that range. And the team here will tell you that our next target is 3 million tons by 2021. I will tell you that our next target is to be maintaining tons by 2020. And frankly the JV that you have heard us talk about in the script, the JV with JFE is going to be a big boost, not only in that particular project or on the galvanizing side, but frankly the recognition that Nucor has achieved by being picked as a partner with JFE, clearly the premier automotive field producer in the world will put to bed finally this argument about whether or not automotive grade steel can be made in an electric arc furnace shop, particularly one that has Nucor name on the front of the facility.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to next to Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Kurtz","I have a question for you on CRU-minus contracts. So, I guess as few years back we started hearing about these for the first time and they cause a lot of problems in the market because it kind of created negative feedback with the pricing. And I thought that they went away, but then I was actually talking to some steel buyers the last few months, and they were talking about having to compete with CRU-minus again. So, I was just wondering if you can give an update like are these a big factor in the market again? Has that changed much over the last few years? And how that\u2019s influencing things right now?","John Ferriola","Clearly CRU-minus drifts in and drifts out, depending upon how the market conditions are. And right now, we\u2019ve heard the same things that you\u2019ve heard that there are some companies out there offering CRU-minus contracts again. But, I want to be real clear about this, we do not do that; we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good business practice. And we take a different approach to it. We think that we sell our products based on quality, service, on-time delivery and we do what we need to do to and be competitive to situations but we do not offer CRU-minus on our sheet business.","Evan Kurtz","And then maybe one other on rebar trade case. So, I know -- the industry tried a trade case on rebar few years back in I guess Turkey and the numbers weren\u2019t really -- rather de minimis. So, what about the case is different this time. I know there\u2019s been some trade laws passed between now and then. How is that going to influence the outcome this time around?","John Ferriola","Well, we feel very positive about the outcome. And frankly, we were disappointed with the outcome last time. But you\u2019re right, the recent changes in the trade laws that we had put into effect last year, these levels of playing field that gave us more tools that we could better argue these cases, we believe more successfully argue these cases. And I will tell you that on rebar particular, we think that we have a strong case to be made. But frankly, when you look at the results that came out of the last trade case, particularly as they related to Turkey, there were commitments made during those hearings where Turkey said that they would not increase their imports into the United States, and you talk about the plastic hockey stick, these things went off the charts. And the fact that the way that the country acted with their imports into United States on rebar after the trade cases left on, we think provides tremendous ammunition for us in this case. And we\u2019re anxious to prosecute it.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Phil Gibbs","You mentioned a lot of these organic growth projects that you\u2019ve got going on over the next couple of years, any sense in terms of the size, Jim, of the CapEx budget this year and next year just to help us with that?","Jim Frias","Yes, we\u2019ve been saying 500 million for this year but that\u2019s actually now going to be up to 635 on a gross basis, because of the reallocation or resetting of our agreements with Encana. But we\u2019re also disposing of a 135 million of assets. So, the net increase is still 500 in our total PP&E. Next year budget has not been set, but I know that there is fairly big ask on the table coming up from the divisions. So, I would think it\u2019s going to probably be at least strong at this year\u2019s that 500 million range.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Aldo Mazzaferro with Macquarie.","Aldo Mazzaferro","A question for Jim on the LIFO. I would have guessed with scrap down and some of the other commodities down that you would be going the other way towards LIFO income. Can you comment on what you might expect for the full year or what drove the higher expected LIFO this quarter?","Jim Frias","Yes. So, if you look at where we\u2019re at end of the half, we have $46.5 million of expanse on a gross basis and we\u2019re targeting 93 million for the year. And based on what we did in third quarter, we\u2019re now targeting 141 for the year, which means we are going to have somewhere in the neighborhood, if our estimates today are accurate, in the neighborhood of 35 million of LIFO expense in the fourth quarter. And the reason we bumped up the pace is because of the timing of how -- mainly how, the timing how DIR and pig iron affect us. And we buy pig iron on a lagging quarter basis and it influences our overall cost of DIR as well. And so, those two commodities came in deliveries in the third quarter, and it influenced our inventory overall positioning; it took greater step than we were expecting. So that\u2019s changed our outlook for the balance at the end of year.","Aldo Mazzaferro","Okay, thank you. And John, the question on the -- might be a little political but given both candidates are out there with pretty massive comments on infrastructure, one bigger than the other, and I know Trump has the nickel [ph] on his team. I am wondering whether you one candidate or the other as more beneficial to infrastructure spending and whether you also would expect either candidate to come out with something that could be significant and early in their tenure?","John Ferriola","Well, I am just going to make a general comment, say that we\u2019re really pleased that both sides of the aisle, both candidates and both political parties are finally understanding the importance of fair and balanced trade. And we\u2019re really excited about that, whichever candidate that gives in, we hope that they live up to the campaign promises they made to recognize the importance of enforcing our trade laws. And also building on second part of your question, both candidates have spoken about the infrastructure of the United States. And I will tell you to me personally, as you know I come from New York. I was in New York a few weeks ago, the conditions of the highways and bridges in New York are deplorable; it\u2019s an embracement to United States of America. And when you look at some of the estimates that are out there today by different agencies that rate the bridges, rate the roads, they are talking about a need of spending almost $3 trillion over the next five years, just to get them up to a B or B plus level. Think about that amount; that\u2019s tremendous, it\u2019s long overdue. I hope both candidates or whichever candidate -- excuse me, each of the candidates, whichever gets in, lives up to their commitment, both on infrastructure and on maintaining the strong enforcement of our trading loss. And that goes not only for the presidency but for congress also.","Aldo Mazzaferro","And John, the assets that you have not operating today, you know the utilization rate not at 100%, would you say it\u2019s fair that the ones that are not at full capacity are mostly the construction related steels?","John Ferriola","As a general statement, yes.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Mr. John Ferriola for any additional or closing remarks.","John Ferriola","So, let me just conclude by saying to our Nucor family, our customers, our shareholders, our teammates, thank you. Thank you for your business, thank you for your support. To our teammates, thank you for your hard work that you do every day. Your contributions have led us to the position of strength that we enjoy today and ensure a bright future for all of us. Most importantly to my teammates, thank you for doing it safely.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","Certain statements made during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Please go ahead, sir.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Thank you, Carolyn. Good afternoon. This is Dan DiMicco, Nucor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you for joining us for our conference call today. As always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team: our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Ferriola; our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey, Keith Grass, Ladd Hall, Ham Lott and Joe Stratman.","First and most importantly, as always, I want to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin and NuMit Steel Technology teams for your excellent work in an economic environment that remains very challenging. The company's greatest competitive advantage is your strong commitment to working hard, working smart and working together and, most importantly, working safely. The Nucor team is succeeding by taking care of our customers, all of our customers, and I want to thank you all for that.","I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to discuss our first quarter results and financial position. He will be followed by John Ferriola, who will report on Nucor's operations and our growth initiatives. I will conclude our presentation with some general commentary on our economy and Nucor's strategy. Jim?","James D. Frias","Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. First quarter of 2012 earnings of $0.46 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.30 to $0.35 per diluted share. That outperformance primarily resulted from stronger than expected shipments from our steel mills to outside customers during the month of March. Our results also benefited from approximately $0.04 per diluted share of state income tax adjustments.","The first quarter 2012 effective tax rate, measured as a percentage of earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, was 27.4%. After adjusting our profits belonging to our noncontrolling interest business partners, the effective tax rate was 29.8%. Our minority interest partners are responsible for the income tax liability and their share of joint venture profits.","First quarter 2012 earnings increased modestly from fourth quarter 2011 earnings of $0.43 per diluted share, which included about $0.08 of nonrecurring gains. Compared to the fourth quarter, profit improvement was strongest at our sheet mills. Our plate and beam mills achieved strong profitability that was comparable to their fourth quarter performance. With margin pressure from increased rebar imports, profitability in our bar mills declined. Earnings for our raw material business improved somewhat in the fourth quarter, but decreased significantly from the first quarter of last year as a result of seasonally atypical softness in scrap prices. Our construction products businesses experienced a normal seasonal slowdown, but backlogs, both pricing and volume, have increased from last year's first quarter levels.","As we often say, our team uses economic downturns as opportunities to grow stronger. Emerging from downturns stronger than we entered them is how we build long-term value for our shareholders. We grow stronger because our financial strength allows us to invest in attractive financial opportunities that expand our earnings capacity through the economic cycle. Nucor has earned the highest credit rating awarded to any metals and mining company in North America, an A2 rating from Moody's and an A rating from Standard & Poor's. We're the only steel producer in North America to enjoy the very important competitive advantage of an investment grade rating. Globally, our credit rating is matched by only one other steel producer, Nippon Steel. To that point, Standard & Poor's, in its April 13 report entitled, \u201cNorth American's Metal and Mining Companies\u2019 Strongest Weakness,\u201d again ranked Nucor #1 for credit rating and credit outlook among a universe of 70 companies. Nucor was also the only metals and mining company in the group that S&P awarded a strong business risk profile due to our competitive position and profit performance relative to our peers.","Cash, short-term investments and restricted cash totaled $3 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2012. Restricted cash of $586 million is available to fund a significant portion of the DRI plant we are building in Louisiana. Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn and does not mature until December 2016. We have no commercial paper outstanding.","At the end of the first quarter, long-term debt totaled $4.3 billion. We expect our leverage to decline as a result of long-term debt maturities of $650 million in the fourth quarter this year and an additional $250 million in 2013. Our plan is to fund those maturities by drawing from a healthy liquidity and continued strong operating cash flow. In 2012, we are continuing to invest in projects that will grow our long-term earnings power and provide attractive returns to our shareholders.","We project 2012 capital spending of approximately $1 billion or more than double 2011 capital spending of $441 million. 2012 capital spending in our Louisiana DRI raw materials project is expected to increase to approximately $450 million in 2012. That's from about $50 million in 2011. It is worth noting that a large number of additional projects are also being implemented throughout our upstream, steelmaking and downstream businesses to develop new products, increase quality and reduce costs. John Ferriola will review some highlights for you in his report.","In addition to allowing us to invest in attractive growth opportunities, Nucor's strong financial position and cash flow generation has enabled our company to reward our shareholders with an impressive record of cash dividends. With our first quarter of 2012 payment, Nucor has increased its regular base dividend for the 39th consecutive year. Reflecting Nucor's team's success in growing long-term earnings power, the base quarterly dividend has increased approximately tenfold over the past 11 years.","For the second quarter of 2012, we expect earnings to modestly improve from the first quarter level. Several end-use markets, such as automotive, heavy equipment, energy and general manufacturing, have continued to experience improvement in demand, benefiting primarily our SBQ, sheet and plate products. We are also seeing small but encouraging signs of improvement in our construction products businesses. However, steel mill pricing and metal margins remained under pressure from the resurgence in imports, along with the impact of new and restarted domestic supply in the sheet market.","Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance around the middle of the final month of the quarter. We are excited by the opportunities we see ahead to reward our shareholders with very attractive long-term returns. Our competitive advantages will continue to be the flexibility, diversification and sustainability found in Nucor's business model.","Thanks for your interest in Nucor. Dan?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Thank you, Jim. I'll now ask John Ferriola to report on Nucor's operations and the implementation of our growth initiatives. John?","John J. Ferriola","Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon. Let me begin by thanking all of our raw materials, steelmaking and steel product teammates for your outstanding commitment to working safely and to taking care of Nucor's customers. You are Nucor's most valuable asset and our most powerful competitive advantage, the right people living our culture every day. Working together, our team is growing Nucor's long-term earnings power. Thank you, and please keep it going.","Dan and Jim both discussed the ongoing challenging economic and steel market conditions experienced so far in 2012. We are very proud of the performance of all of our businesses in this adverse environment. This performance increases our already strong confidence in the Nucor team ability to continue delivering industry-leading through-the-cycle return on capital performance.","Nucor's first quarter 2012's steel mill capacity utilization of 79% highlights the value of our position as North America's most diversified steel producer. Our sheet and plate mills ran at very healthy utilization rates during the quarter. Nucor's strong and growing presence in the sheet and plate markets positioned us to benefit from relatively strong demand from our customers in the automotive, energy, heavy equipment, agricultural and railcar sectors.","Contrary to some market observers' claim that Nucor is \"just a construction play,\" our overall mill utilization rate exceeded the industry's first quarter rate of 78%. And that is more difficult to accomplish when you are the industry's largest producer.","Our SBQ bar business is also capitalizing on strength in the automotive, energy, agricultural and heavy equipment markets. It's worth noting that Nucor Steel Nebraska\u2019s investment last year in a quality assurance line is receiving a tremendous response from our customers. It includes an offline bar straightener and performs both surface and ultrasonic inspections. These new value-added capabilities are already helping Nebraska penetrate more demanding and higher-margin engineer bar applications.","While demand from nonresidential construction markets remains at very depressed levels, we continue to believe that the construction market has, at a minimum, stabilized. In fact, our rebar fabrication and custom-engineered metal buildings businesses are seeing year-over-year increases in orders and in backlogs. Margins for our Vulcraft's vertical groups joist and deck business improved in the first quarter as pricing increased to levels more reflective of raw materials and other input costs.","As I said at the start of my comments, we are very proud of the results our team has achieved in these tough economic times. Even better, we are extremely excited about the impressive work being done by our raw material, steelmaking and downstream products teams during these bad times to prepare Nucor for the good times ahead.","Here are updates on some of the projects underway to expand our company's long-term earnings power: Construction of our Louisiana DRI plant is on schedule for a mid-2013 start of production. As we have begun erecting the structural steel for the furnace, the plant now has a skyline. Annual capacity will be 2.5 million metric tons. Combined with the recently completed expansion of our Trinidad DRI plant's annual capacity of 2 million tons, Louisiana's first DRI margin will bring us to about 2\/3 of our goal to control from 6 million to 7 million tons of annual capacity in high-quality scrap substitutes. Implementation of our raw material strategy will be a game changer in advancing Nucor's growth in the sheet and SBQ markets.","Our David J. Joseph team completed 3 acquisitions in the first quarter, located in Florida, Colorado and North Carolina. These bolt-on acquisitions expand DJJ's regional scrap recycling platforms and increase Nucor's total annual scrap processing capacity by about 5%.","Work began in the first quarter on our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill's wide light project. The addition of a seventh hot mill stand will provide Berkeley with the capability to produce wider and lighter gauge, hot-rolled sheet steel. We will be able to produce hot band, pickled and oiled, and cold-rolled at a finished length of 72 inches. Berkeley will also supply our Decatur, Alabama sheet mill's state-of-the-art, automotive-quality galvanizing line with 72-inch coils. We are committing $100 million of capital to this project because of the tremendous opportunities it will provide to the entire Nucor Sheet Mill Group to move up the value chain and flat-rolled markets. We expect to accelerate our growth into agricultural, pipe and tube, industrial equipment, heavy truck and automotive high strength and ultra high strength applications. Our Berkeley team is on track to complete construction and start production by the end of 2013.","Building on the outstanding success of their new heat treated line, our Hertford County, North Carolina plate mill team expects to complete construction and start commissioning a vacuum tank degasser in this year's third quarter. That will be followed by the addition of a normalizing line in 2013. These projects further advance our strategy of expanding our value-added product mix in the plate market.","Our Hickman, Arkansas sheet mill team is also installing a vacuum tank degasser to grow their value-added product offerings. As the westernmost flat-rolled mill in the United States with a vacuum degasser, Hickman will be strategically positioned to serve the vibrant markets in the Southwest United States and in Mexico. The degasser is expected to be operating by the end of this year.","Work is underway to increase our SBQ and wire rod annual capacity at our mills in Nebraska, South Carolina and Tennessee by a combined 1 million tons. The total capital cost is expected to be $290 million, and completion is scheduled by the end of 2013. Our expanded SBQ product will position us for continued growth in automotive, energy, general manufacturing applications.","Vertical integration downstream into value added products will continue to be a major contributor to Nucor's profitable growth. Our joist and deck rebar fabrication and custom-engineered metal-building businesses are building their long-term earnings power by drawing both a geographical footprint and their product offerings.","Our 50% owned Steel Technologies' flat-rolled steel processing joint venture announced plans earlier this month to construct a facility in Celaya, Mexico. Celaya is expected to be fully operational by the end of this year. Steel Technologies' new facility in Monterrey is also expected to be completed by year's end. With the addition of these 2 facilities, Steel Technologies will have a total of 5 processing facilities in Mexico.","We believe these exciting projects and with strong prospects for more to come make it clear that our team's unrelenting focus remains on long-term sustainable growth in Nucor's profitability.","Thank you for your interest in our company. Dan?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Thank you, John. The 21,000 men and women of Nucor have again delivered a solid and profitable performance and what Stanford economist, Edward Lazear, recently described as the worst economic recovery in history. In his opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal on April 3, Professor Lazear laid out the ugly facts of the current recovery. Since this recovery began in the second half of 2009, the United States economy has grown at an annual rate of just 2.4%. That mini growth rate is well below the rates experienced in past recoveries and even lags the average annual growth rate of 3.4% delivered by the U.S. economy over the 60-year postwar period from 1947 to 2007. Dr. Lazear also give -- points to reasons for this dismal performance. I will quote his words. \"The government policies have focused on short-run changes and gimmicks -- recall Cash for Clunkers and first-time home buyer credits -- rather than creating conditions that are favorable to investment that raise productivity, wages and create jobs.\" In his essay, he also highlights other damaging actions that include the threat of higher taxes, constantly increasing regulatory burdens and ineffective trade practices and policies. Nucor and the U.S. steel industry face these severe economic headwinds every day.","The 2 industry data points tell the story: The first is the U.S. steel industry's capacity utilization rate of less than 78% in this year's first quarter are well below rates approaching 90% prior to the onset of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008. The second data point, which is heavily influencing industry capacity utilization, relates to surging import levels. Through the first 2 months of this year, imports of finished steel have increased 36% over the year-ago period. Major products with significant increases include rebar, plate and tubular goods for the energy market. There is no doubt that the legality of these imports will be strongly challenged in the months to come.","Let's be completely honest with ourselves. The U.S. economy has not had a sustainable and healthy recovery from the great recession that began almost 4 years ago. And it's not going to get on the right path until our country moves back to creating, innovating, making and building things as the major driver of our economic -- and economy's growth. The time is right and long overdue to reinvigorate the American economy by seizing new opportunities in energy, infrastructure rebuilding and growing a globally competitive U.S. manufacturing sector that is primed and ready to prosper in an environment of rules-based free trade.","On the energy and competitiveness front, I have one further comment. Make no mistake, natural gas recovery technology and the enormous reserves created by it are a game changer of historic proportions, that, if used properly and wisely, will drive a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing and fuel economic growth and job creation for decades to come. Our challenge as Americans right now is to get our government and business leadership to go together arm in arm into the world of global economic competition. Reflecting on the history of our country's successes winning World War II and the space race, there is little our nation can't accomplish when we go forward together as Americans and leave our political differences behind us. This is the responsibility of leadership. And the failure to achieve this unity is a failure of leadership.","The Nucor team will continue to do our part to shine a bright light on this exciting path forward to sustainable and vigorous growth for the American economy and U.S.-based manufacturing. And our team is bullish on the American people and their ability to do the right things. That is why we are busy building a stronger Nucor. A stronger Nucor is one positioned to deliver higher highs and higher lows in earnings power through successive economic cycles. Over the 2008 to 2012 period, Nucor will have invested more than $6 billion of capital by a disciplined execution of our 5-pronged growth strategy: first, to optimize and continually improve our existing operations and our teammates' skill sets; second, execute and grow our raw material strategy; third, expand through greenfield growth, taking advantage of new technology and unique marketplace niches where major cost advantage can be attained; fourth, seek international growth via joint ventures; and fifth, grow through strategic acquisitions. And it's Nucor's superior competitive position with our financial strength, product diversification, operational flexibility and unique culture that allows us to continue growing our earnings power during times of economic distress.","I want to again thank everyone in our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin and NuMit Steel Technology teams for a job well done in the first quarter. You are the reason that we can say with the greatest confidence that Nucor's best is yet to come.","We would like to take your questions at this time. Please feel free to join the question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You've outlined some compelling economics for the DRI plant. I just wanted to get an update on how you're thinking about further capacity expansions there. If that works, as you're expecting, is that something where you could consider building it out to be an exporter or to be even more self-sufficient?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, certainly, yes, the self-sufficient part is part of our strategy. As we have talked before on numerous occasions, we currently are permitted for two 2.5 million metric ton DRI plants. And the initial part of our strategy will be to build the first one and then to build the second. Exactly when we start building the second, it has not been determined. It could be as early as while we're still starting up the first one. We also have the opportunity to build 2 more units there for a total of 4, which will give us somewhere in the vicinity of 12 million metric tons of DRI capability and capacity, which could be used entirely in Nucor. If the market said we should export some of it, we would do so. John, do you have any comments you want to add to that?","John J. Ferriola","The only thing I would add, Dan, is that we are building the first DRI facility with the capability, all of the infrastructure in place for our second DRI unit of 2.5 million metric tons.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So is there any reason why not moving forward sooner if you already are familiar with the DRI technology in Trinidad? I mean, is this a new competency for Nucor that you could plan to develop more aggressively going ahead?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, caution is just a matter of the times we're in. The need to move at a faster pace than what we're planning on is not necessarily there. And we -- as John said, we're building the infrastructure for the second one. So to construct the second one will be a considerably shorter time frame. Let's get one done and ready to operate, and then we will go from there. As far as new business strategy goes, our intent here is to utilize the DRI to replace the 3-plus million tons of pig iron and other high-quality scrap substitutes on an economic, competitive basis going forward and be in control more of our own supply. And with the natural gas opportunities that will be with us for the next 20 to 40 years, we think this is a wise way to go.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Kuni Chen with CRT Capital Group.","Kuni M. Chen - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I was just hoping you could give us a little bit more color around your expectations for modest improvements in the second quarter, maybe talk about how the pace of order entry has progressed through the first quarter and what you're seeing so far in April. Could you give us some view on lead times and whether that's changed at all across your business lines?","Daniel R. DiMicco","John?","John J. Ferriola","Why don\u2019t we start with order entry rates. The year started fairly strong on order entry. We saw a dip around the middle of the first quarter. After the dip, a short period of 2 or 3 weeks, we began to see both volume and pricing recovery. So it's been a slow but steady recovery from the middle of the first quarter to where we are today both on volume and on pricing. Going forward, given the current match between capacity and demand, we would see both volume and pricing to stabilize in the near future.","Kuni M. Chen - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, on the steel product segment, we're getting closer to breakeven in that area. When do you expect to see that cross back into the black?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, we are definitely closer. At some of our divisions, we are actually in the black, but it is a slow process. And until we start to see a significantly stronger trend in construction, it will be -- we won't see a significant flip over to the black until that happens. And right now, we're looking at a slow progress continuing for the entire year of 2012. John, do you have anything you want to add to that?","John J. Ferriola","No, I would say that we do believe that the construction market is stabilizing and we see some signs of improvement. The API has been above 50% now for 5 months in a row. That's a very positive sign. Of course, there's a lead time element in that. So there\u2019s several months out there before we begin to see that in actual construction starts. But again, as we said in the script, we think at least, at a minimum, the construction market is stabilizing. And we have seen increases in our backlogs and in the order entry rate in Harris rebar and in our building systems. So those are somewhat encouraging signs.","Daniel R. DiMicco","One of the early indicators that seem to be sending a positive signal in our pre-engineered metal buildings, which will usually improve before our joist business and the overall construction market, is the size of the jobs that are actually going forward. And over the last couple of months, we've seen more and more large jobs than we have seen for some time. But it's still at the beginning stages. And whether it stays at a trend, an upward slope, or whether it flattens out or drops back, up until this point in time, we just seem to be on a sinusoidal curve that just goes up and down, up and down about a fairly steady bottom in the construction markets. So we're not getting overly excited, but it is a positive observation and we'll see if it continues.","Operator","And our next question will come from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question is related to DJJ. You made a couple of acquisitions there. I was wondering if you can walk us through the thought process because the margins have been under pressure a little bit. Is this a signal of a turn that you're seeing? Or is it more strategic with respect to those 3 unique acquisition?","Daniel R. DiMicco","John?","John J. Ferriola","Well, as I mentioned, the 3 acquisitions were what we refer to as bolt-on acquisitions. And the strategy behind it is to get better control on the feeder lots so that we have a more steady and consistent supply of scrap into our yards for processing. As far as going forward, we will continue to do that when it makes sense, when the opportunities present themselves, and continue to grow our business in times that we are able to process for feedstock into our mills.","Daniel R. DiMicco","We've been very disciplined. Keith and his team have been very disciplined about the acquisitions that we have been making. There has been no rush. When we get an opportunity to have a very cost-competitive, effective acquisition, they\u2019ve been executing on them and that will continue going forward.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I was wondering if we can turn to your prepared comments about the import market. Spreads have definitely narrowed, if not collapsed, between Europe and the U.S. and so forth. Where do you see it going forward over the next couple of months? Do you think it stabilizes, comes down? Is there certain parts of the market where -- flat-rolled versus rebar or something -- that you're more concerned about or less concerned about?","Daniel R. DiMicco","I like the way you transitioned very quickly from one term to another when you went to \"collapsed.\" The margins have tightened and then collapsed, which is typical of surges in imports when they take place. And listen, we have a U.K. -- a global economy that is sputtering. We have a domestic economy that is growing at a snail's pace. And there's massive oversupply in some products here in the United States and around the world, created in this country by both domestic overcapacity based upon the demand levels we're seeing, not based upon peak demand and the influx of imports. In particular, we've seen a significant, a serious flood of imports from Turkey, reinforcing bar and a little bit on merchant. And we're starting to see it on sheet and we're concerned about that. And it's not just what happens with respect to the first order move out of one country, but it can, and this has been the case with China as they export more and more product to other places in the world. People move the exports that they had to those areas to other areas, and for the U.S. market being the most open. Clearly, this flood of imports is -- it's not being driven by demand. It's being -- it's a excess supply push on the part of the global steel industry and the trading environment. And as such, it usually leads to distortions in pricing and cost. And as such, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, you can rest assured that we will be moving forward with legal challenges to Washington to this flood of imports that have taken place and deal with them in the only way that we have possible to deal with them when they're not market driven, surges in imports and movement of steel. So it's a serious issue. It affects all the products eventually. And it's been more so in the long products, rebar business and in the sheet business. We're starting to see some of that in plate. Yes, the margins are compressing, but the problem with that is the damage is being done as these margins continue to compress. There's no way in heck that in this domestic industry, if competing on a level playing field, all things being equal, that an industry running at 78% or less than capacity needs a 36% increase in imports to satisfy the demand. And it doesn't come in here unless it is underpriced and many times priced below the cost to produce. So those issues are with us. They\u2019ve been with us for decades. We continue to fight them. We continue to win. It's unfortunate that we cannot have something that's more proactive in dealing with these surges on the part of our government, but we are even working on that as we speak.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","One final question, if I may. Can you remind us what your auto exposure is and what the impact would be? If I remember, it would be smaller than others if the auto companies were to bring forward some of their maintenance and retooling schedules due to some of the resin issues out there in the marketplace?","Daniel R. DiMicco","John?","John J. Ferriola","Well, let me comment first on what our exposure is. I like to think of it as our participation, not our exposure. Our participation has grown in automotive probably to the tune of 10% to 15% over the last year. And we see that as a very good market for us. We have developed many products. We've been able to put into that light gauge, high strength, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, ultra high-strength products. So on the sheet side, our participation has grown 10% to 15%. The automotive build this year is expected to increase by about a million units, up from somewhere in the neighborhood of 13 million, 13.5 million, up to about 14 million, 14.5 million units. And don't forget, in addition to the sheet business going into automotive, we have a lot of participation from our SBQ group. And that participation is also growing both as a result of new products that we're introducing and as a result of the volume that we'll have to be able to put into those markets as a result of some of our expansion projects that we've mentioned in the script. The only thing I would add to that, Dan, is that I mentioned Steel Technology expanding in Mexico. The Mexican automotive market production has increased tremendously in the last 4 to 5 years, again, to the tune over that period of about a million units of build, taking it from somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 million units in Mexico 4 or 5 years ago up to about 4 million units today. So we\u2019re well positioned, both in the Southeast, where there's a large growth in automotive production and in Mexico, where we're also seeing a large growth in automotive production. So we see our participation in the automotive as a very positive thing.","Daniel R. DiMicco","What percent of our overall business, John, is going into automotive if you bring together the bar, SBQ, the sheet, the fasteners, you name it, what are we looking at?","John J. Ferriola","Probably close to about 2 billion tons. So we added 20 million tons.","Daniel R. DiMicco","As far as the impact of this resin shortage that seems to be certainly being talked about with the outage in Germany, it's going to affect every player in the business. Some companies, obviously, have greater exposure to automotive than we do. Ours is growing. And what that impact is going to be is not something we can speculate on. It just depends how the oil companies handle it and how much they cut back production, if at all. I think they\u2019re actively working to find other sources of materials to be able to use, to replace those not on resins, out of Germany.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to chat again about D.J. Joseph. We keep hearing from scrap processors and they\u2019re struggling to kind of earn their cost of capital at this point, that there\u2019s too much trading capacity in the U.S., and I just kind of wanted to get your views on that. Do you think it's a longer term problem, does capacity need to come out or can we grow into this?","Keith B. Grass","Well, it's probably -- this is Keith. It's probably a combination of the 2. As the economy improves, it will generate more scrap and make more unprepared scrap available to various scrap processors around the country. But there is no doubt that during the shredding business today, you have experienced increased competition over the last several years. There's been a significant jump in the number of shredders in the country. So as you've seen in past cycles, there is a trend towards consolidation, as well as we will grow through it with increased scrap generation.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Are you actually starting to see any scrap prices and facilities come out at this point? Or is it just consolidation at the moment?","Keith B. Grass","I would say more consolidation -- slight consolidation. I haven't really seen anybody drop out at this point in time.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just one other question. I was looking at the kind of year-on-year numbers for the first quarter '12 versus the first quarter '11, you have metal margins up about $14 a ton, energy down about $2 a ton. Are there any other kind of nonmetal and non-energy costs, significant costs, that I should be aware of?","James D. Frias","This is Jim Frias, not that I can think of. You'll need the API, too, above $100.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Aaron Viswanisen [ph] with Longbow Research.","Unknown Analyst","I just wanted to see if you guys could maybe give us a number and help us understand like how much of your sheet products are -- what you'd characterize as value add. And through these projects that you have, where are you going to get to and how many other projects would you consider to take that number higher?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, earlier, John mentioned that we're putting a total of about 2 million tons into the automotive-type market. But frankly, talk about value add, it covers many more products and many more uses across agriculture and energy and what have you. So John, what's your thoughts on that?","John J. Ferriola","One way you can look at it is that on the sheet side, the split between our hot-rolled product and our cold-rolled and galvanized product, and our percentage that goes into the highest strength in ultra high strength markets. And on the SBQ side, I would say that all of our SBQ products are value added products. So that's fairly easy to address. Currently, our split is about 55% hot band to 45% cold-rolled and further process galvanized product. In terms of our high strength and ultra high strength, we continuously move in more and more of our tonnage into those areas and going into areas we mentioned, automotive, but also appliance, agricultural are big areas for our value added products going into those markets. So we continue to see it grow. And on the sheet side, if I were to take a round number on all of our value added, cold-rolled, galvanized and ultra high strength, I would say somewhere in the neighborhood of 55% to 60%. And our current SBQ capacity, which is all value added, would be roughly 1.5 million tons. So when you look at those totals, it's a pretty good number overall.","Unknown Analyst","And then you guys have talked about the import pressures and especially now on the rebar side as well as Turkey. I mean, assuming that some of these pressures are here to stay, is there any value added projects you guys can undertake to address that as well in the rebar and some of these more commoditized markets?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Before we answer that specifically, I just want to add on the plate side of our business, we're currently somewhere around 10% of what we would call highly value added through heat treat, growing to about 20% as we bring on the normalizing facility that's currently under construction and the vacuum degasser that's being put into place. So you're looking at somewhere around 200,000 to 350,000 tons of our 1.5 million, 1.6 million ton plate capacity roughly at our Hertford plant. Now I'm not talking about our Tuscaloosa operation, which is another million-plus tons. And as far as the imports of rebar and Turkey and other Russians and other places, Chinese, those are going to get dealt with. They come in cycles, unfortunately. As margins drop down or as we put in place effective trade remedies to the core systems, they will be dealt with going forward. We'd like to think that they would stop on their own because we haven't seen that in the past. And as far as putting in other products to replace that business because on the order of magnitude, the size of our rebar business, that just is not going to happen. That's the bottom line. And we are continually working to move up in all product lines into more value-added product, but we don't vacate the lower value product. We just use it to grow our total market participation. And when you have 8 million tons of rebar capability, it's not something you're going to replace with a few hundred thousand tons of this or a few hundred thousand tons of that. It's an issue that has to be dealt with in the marketplace.","Operator","And our next question today will come from Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Dan, I just wanted to ask you a question on your average selling price for the steel division. It was up $8 quarter-over-quarter from fourth to first quarter, considerably lower than the spot market pricing figures. I was just wondering is it a matter of mix or is it a lag because you have more contracts now and you didn't get the full price increase. Can you give us some color on that?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Are you saying that on sheet product...","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm just looking at your average selling price if I divide your volume of steel shipments should be. Total value...","Daniel R. DiMicco","Total price of all products. You have to keep in mind that there have been upward and downward movements depending upon the product during the course of the quarter. And so you can't draw a generalized comment on the flat-rolled business from that particular change in selling price because you've got an equal amount of long products and plate products included in that. So I'm not sure I know how to answer that question. If you want to try again.","John J. Ferriola","Sohail, one thing I would add is if you look at the schedules that we posted on our website, we have one called sales price and scrap cost. Our actual steel selling prices in the first quarter were $824. In the fourth quarter, they were $806. The increase was bigger than $8 per ton. They are closer to $18 per ton.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, I was just calculating based on just the volume and revenue, okay. But also, how are your contracts? And how much is your flat-rolled contracts? And how do these work?","Daniel R. DiMicco","John?","John J. Ferriola","Our contract design team [ph] in our sheet business is about 50% and within that 50% of contract business, there's a myriad of different pricing mechanisms. Some are scrap based. Some are CRU based on a monthly adjusted basis. And some are CRU based with the changes occurring on a quarterly basis based on the previous quarter's average selling price. So there's a multitude of different structures, but within sheet about 50% of our tonnage is under contract. On the -- we have a sign here. Virtually all of our SBQ products, 50%. About 50% of our SBQ products are also under contracts that are based on CRU or other pricing mechanisms.","James D. Frias","Yes and on the SBQ contracts, we have a base price plus a floating surcharge based on a scrap index.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jim, are these monthly contracts, monthly adjustments on SBQ?","James D. Frias","They vary, but our contracts typically run from 3 months up to 1 year, and they are adjusted monthly based on a scrap index.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One more question, Dan, if I may. I was reading a report recently that Trinidad is running short of reserves of natural gas, and I was wondering how long is your contract over there and what are the adjustments you will have in the contract once that gas price contract runs out.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Yes, first off, I think what you're referring to as a shortage of natural gas is more an issue of poor maintenance or maintenance issues on the platforms that they have. And it has caused some interruptions, and I don't know exactly how many days we have lost in production down there. I don't think it's been a huge number. But the contract itself is not in jeopardy in terms of the life of that contract. I think we have -- I don't know how many years left, 15 years -- 14 or 15 years left in the contract, and to the best of my knowledge -- and Ladd Hall, you might want to comment -- there's not a concern on our part that there won't be gas available to service that contract. Ladd?","Ladd R. Hall","There's no -- in actuality, the platform problem ended mid-February. They're all back online now, but they have some excess capacity right now that they\u2019re not even using. And we don't anticipate, at least in the foreseeable future, any shortages on natural gas. And as Dan said, we have that contract for the next 14 or 15 years. So we don't anticipate any problem in Trinidad.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Aldo Mazzaferro with Macquarie Securities Group.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","On the DRI, Dan, I know your friends at Steel Dynamics are saying that they might be able to save something like $100 a ton against the cost of pig iron once they bring their Mesabi Nugget plant on. And the way I view your DRI facility, it seems like an easier technology, more experience that you have with it and certainly larger scale. But do you think that per ton comparisons -- are you looking at those same kind of things where you could say, $350 a ton DRI versus $450 pig or something like that?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Listen, I don't want to get into commenting about where SDI is or isn't and their Mesabi Nugget experience. Certainly, the DRI is a proven technology. I think other technologies that we worked with, and we have worked with Mesabi Nugget ourselves several years before other people started working with it. The cost and benefits of the DRI operation are significant, larger than the magnitude that you're quoting. But it depends on where the other raw material pricing is. It depends on where scrap is. It depends on where pig iron pricing is. So to make a blanket statement that it gives a $100 a ton cost advantage over other ways of providing yourself with the raw materials, it's very dependent upon where the other pricing is. Certainly, with the price of natural gas, where it is and where it'll be, they won\u2019t stay at these low levels over anywhere near the lifespan of our DRI operations. We're looking at substantial cost benefits. That's why we're doing it versus just buying pig iron on the open market let alone prime grades of scrap.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","Great. So, Dan, are you going to stay fairly short-term in buying practices for iron ore, like 3-month-type pricing or where do you think?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, let's see how that works, Al. We have 0 control over iron ore companies that price their product in that order [ph] and price it over. So we will be subject to whatever the market conditions dictate, and until such time as we have some kind of opportunity on our own to be an ore producer or a partner in an ore project, which is something that we're continually looking at.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","Great. And final question, Dan, on the imports, I mean, I don't want to stir up a hornet's nest, but in a sense, wasn't it just...","Daniel R. DiMicco","You don't have to. They already have.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","But didn't U.S. raise prices $100 a ton relative to the world and get a premium that just attracted imports quite simply? And isn't that still legal?","Daniel R. DiMicco","That's not the issue whether the prices were $100 a ton difference. The issue is whether the pricing that they're at is below their home market pricing and below the cost of production. And certainly, if they are abiding by the globally agreed-upon rules in that regard, there's no issue. And we just have to deal with it. And there's no legal recourse that's going to change that, that the issue has been proven time and time again. I don't know where your head has been lately over the last 20 years, Aldo, but I know it hasn't been stuck in the sand like an ostrich. You know darn well that we've won numerous, numerous cases against virtually every country in the world for cheating on the global trading system. And they've held up in court and not only our court, but the World Court. So to imply that if nobody ever does anything wrong when they import it to the United States and that somehow because we had $100 a ton price differential, that we were the bad guys. And out there, we try and get -- make a profit on our product when other folks are just interested in dumping their product to keep people employed. Now that's ludicrous, my friend. But you're entitled to your question.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Brian Yu with Citi.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On the export side, can you provide us with a percentage of your shipments that were exported in the quarter?","John J. Ferriola","We've been averaging somewhere in the neighborhood of about 10%. It's probably off a little bit in the first quarter as a result of the economic conditions worldwide. So it might be down a little bit, maybe in the 7% to 8% range.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and then second one, just with the point of $50 million that you got committed to the DRI project, will any of that be funded by the restricted cash you've got in your balance sheet? I think that's about close to $600 million.","John J. Ferriola","Yes, that's what all that cash will be used for, is that DRI facility.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and will that be going into this year's $450 million spending?","John J. Ferriola","Yes, it will.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right, if I can get one last one. At SBQ, could you give us a sense of what the end markets are and then with the 1 million ton expansion you got coming online, would that be geared towards the same end markets? Or do you see that being targeted maybe the strong ones like machinery or whatever else?","John J. Ferriola","Obviously, automotive, as I mentioned earlier in the day, heavy truck, heavy equipment, Caterpillar, those kind of operations. Agricultural is another one that's very strong.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Energy.","John J. Ferriola","Energy would be yet another one that's very strong. So there are several markets that we are putting our product in today. And as we continue to bring new grades and qualifications into our Memphis facility, that list is growing.","Daniel R. DiMicco","As we talked before, some of the heavy equipment manufacturers and other manufacturers are, as we speak, either opening or building or getting ready to construct new facilities in North America, particularly the United States, that will increase the demand for those products above where they are today or in a what would have been considered a previously strong volume market.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Do you have a rough split of these various type of markets on the SBQ side? I mean, just the top 3 or what percentage it might account for.","John J. Ferriola","Auto would definitely be #1. Heavy equipment would be #2. How about trucks? Heavy trucks would be #3. Again, I would think more of the question to you that, that changes as different market conditions change also, but that's how we're seeing it in current.","Operator","And our next question today will come from Philip Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just, Dan, my first question was the status of the EPA review in Louisiana, just that we were reading some articles that they were giving you a hard time.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Say that again?","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","The EPA review at your Louisiana DRI facility. We've just been reading that the EPA is giving you a hard time.","Daniel R. DiMicco","The EPA has worked to make it a difficult process at federal level. Luckily, at the state level, we've had extremely good cooperation from the state environmental people in Louisiana and we have the permits in place. Most of the discussions at this point in time revolve around the permit for the blast furnaces that we still have and plan on holding onto and not so much the existing DRI permits.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, I just have a couple of quick ones for Jim. First one was just what were the startup costs in the quarter? And two, the SG&A looked solidly below what it's been running at over the last several quarters. Just curious what the reasons for that were.","James D. Frias","Okay, first on pre-operating and startup cost. We first began breaking it out in our earnings release in mid-2009 because they were both a material relative to our gross profit and they were materially different than they were in 2008. And really, when we got into 2011, they were no longer material relative to 2011's gross profit but we kept disclosing them because in comparison to 2010 when they were higher, there was a change that was fairly material. Now our earnings release includes the income statements for 2011 and 2012. And for both those years, it's not material and they really aren\u2019t that materially different on an apples-to-apples basis, we include all the different components that have been a part of pre-operating startup costs over the year. So they're relatively flat. They\u2019re not material. They're just not worth breaking out right now. We will again in the future when they rise because of the Louisiana startup creating more pre-operating startup costs. But they just haven't changed that much really.","Daniel R. DiMicco","What's the second part of your question?","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I was asking about SG&A?","James D. Frias","Yes, and that was -- yes, we were classifying freight for part of our business differently in the past and we've moved it up in the cost of goods sold. Some of them we're recording in their first [indiscernible]. There has been a reclass and now we account for freight.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So we should look at this as 107?","James D. Frias","It's been morphed with run rate and the baseline.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Richard Garchitorena with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Richard Garchitorena - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So my first question is, just on the press release, there's a comment there saying that you saw unexpected margin weakness in your raw materials business in the Q1. I'm just wondering if you can give some color on that because you don't get the schedule on pricing, and the scrap prices were up quarter-over-quarter.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Yes, the scrap pricing\u2019s up, but the price you pay for it is up as well. Keith, do you want to address that?","Keith B. Grass","I'll go down 2 different roads with it. The first one was scrap market moved up as it moved December into January but then pretty much flattened out or moved down from there. So there was really no sustained upward trend that we had seen in the past during the quarter, which is alluded to in the release this morning. So that's probably really what accounted for a good portion of the squeeze. And the second one would go back to the earlier question about overcapacity of shredders and all. So we're fighting for raw material in this overcapacity situation in a market that was trending flat to down. We saw a squeeze through most of our operations in the -- around the country.","Richard Garchitorena - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great, that's very helpful. And then my second question, it looks like demand is still improving in most end markets with the exception of construction. So given that and given your expectation of modest improvement in earnings in Q2, is there any way we can sort of figure out what your figure is in terms of volumes going forward? Is it really just the pressure on pricing from higher imports and excess of supply or scrap to basically keep margins flat? Or how should we think about that?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Yes, yes, yes and yes. The volumes and the pricing go fairly hand in hand. And so on the demand side, because the economy is really growing at a snail's pace on the steel consumption. And we just recently had some numbers come out in the last day or 2 on manufacturer, where there seems to be a bit of a slowdown, hopefully that\u2019s a temporary thing. We\u2019re not going to get ahead of ourselves on volume forecasts. We do believe volumes will be up modestly, and we do believe pricing on some of our products will be up modestly. Some products will be sideways down. And the net of that is, we see an environment going through the second quarter that will be more profitable but not in a large way. And predicting the volumes with still the uncertainties in the economy and the fits and starts in construction that seem to come and go. It is difficult to do.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Michelle Applebaum with Steel Market Intelligence.","Michelle Applebaum - Michelle Applebaum Research Inc.","I have about 12 questions, so I'll try to restrict it. You said unfortunately, we can't be more proactive on imports, but you're working on things to be more proactive. Can you give us a little color?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Yes, when I say we I\u2019m talking about the government, and so you can take the speed of action out of the government into consideration. Obviously, I'll be qualified by saying that we are working on these things. And that is we are working on coming up with tools that allow our government to be more proactive, i.e. to respond much quicker to floods of imports. Other than that, I won't go any further.","Michelle Applebaum - Michelle Applebaum Research Inc.","Okay, and the second thing is, you're to be congratulated, I think, for resisting the urge to integrate into iron ore as you were moving forward with Louisiana the last 5 or 6 years. Now that your disciplined strategy of not investing in iron ore has been rewarded and the market is more flush and properties are more available, can you give me some idea of where that stands in terms of your priorities from a use of capital perspective?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Subtlety, you are not, Michelle.","Michelle Applebaum - Michelle Applebaum Research Inc.","Gee, 30 years, you didn't notice that.","Daniel R. DiMicco","No, it\u2019s not the first time. It's the first time I\u2019ve commented on it. As I mentioned earlier, we are constantly evaluating the opportunity in iron ore, if there is one or not. And pricing in most commodities go through cycles so we're cognizant of that. And we have had opportunities that we walked away from because they were too expensive. And so we will be very cautious about moving into that space but if the opportunity does present itself and there are some opportunities that could be doing that, we will -- are taking advantage of them but if we do, you can count on the fact that it\u2019s with the idea that higher pricing will not stay in one place over the life of the business cycle.","Michelle Applebaum - Michelle Applebaum Research Inc.","Okay, can I ask another one?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Not 12, but you can ask another one.","Michelle Applebaum - Michelle Applebaum Research Inc.","Okay, because you're answering fast. So one of the most interesting things I've read in the last 6 months was one of the more traditional integrated steelmakers in their 10-K, they've always had a risk factor about mini mills and the risk factor\u2019s varied over the years, but it's always been like lower-cost labor might be competitive, but they use scrap and that might hurt them. And what was interesting this year was this company changed what has been boilerplate language from saying that the mini mills can be a threat but they -- that the integrators are generally able to manufacture a broader range of products. And they changed it this year to say that the mini mills are increasingly able to compete directly with integrated producers in a number of flat-rolled products previously produced only by integrated steelmaking. So I thought that was real significant in a competitor's SEC filing. So my question for you that I've been trying to ask this in the past, can you give me some idea of how many tons increase in the market you're going to be able to reach with these investments you're making in flat-rolled?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Yes, I think John might have a handle on that. John?","John J. Ferriola","Well, the sky is the limit as we move forward, okay, because we never stop climbing the mountain of improved products and quality and finding new ways to enter into new markets. We've done a great job across our company in all of our products and doing this specific to automotive. And we -- in the last 5 to 7 years, the amount of high strength and ultra high strength products, the light gauge that we've been able to produce, the quality of our products that we've been able to produce, the number of vacuum degassers that we've added, all increased, each time increased our potential in automotive and other high-value products. So the number over the last 5 years, we've gone from a very small percentage in automotive to a significant player, as we've said in the past. Today, we've given you some indication of what we would do in automotive as we go forward. We've mentioned the wide light project at Berkeley. And we feel that that's going to boost our participation in automotive strongly. Being able to produce that product in Berkeley shifted to a state of the art automotive qualified galvanized line in Decatur, gives us another window of opportunity. So we feel very encouraged about what we're doing. I would add to that -- you're familiar with our Castrip product and our technology. That opens up another world of opportunity as we continue to grow in grades. As you know, that's an ultralight gauge, cold-rolled replacement product and that we are currently investigating opportunities to put that into automotive product also.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Those are some very general product side. But Michelle, if you're looking for absolute tonnages, there is -- or percentages of the high quality, suppliable market we will be able to service. John's point is a very good one. We don't limit ourselves. We never have, even when we were first getting into the flat-rolled business and people said they\u2019ll never be able to do anything more than decking and construction grades. That was just a matter of time to us, not a fact that could not be overcome. And so you have to really look at this from the standpoint of there's nothing in the automotive sector from a quality standpoint in the flat-rolled or other SBQ or what have you that we will and are not already moving into in a strong way. And when I say strong way, we're talking about hundreds of thousands of tons to millions of tons ability to penetrate that market in terms of the type of product we're capable of making. The rest of it is actually -- comes through being successful and competing for that market. But there is no limit. And so that to ask us what -- how many more tons we're going to get or what percentage we're going to get is, in our minds, limiting and we don't see it as a limiting thing. There's nothing that we won't be able to reach, including exposed automotive. So I don't know how to answer that question. There are no limitations.","Michelle Applebaum - Michelle Applebaum Research Inc.","Maybe and I know these are famous last words, but let me ask it a different way. How much...","Daniel R. DiMicco","Last question.","Michelle Applebaum - Michelle Applebaum Research Inc.","What?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Last question.","Michelle Applebaum - Michelle Applebaum Research Inc.","Well, then I'm just going to ask a different question.","Daniel R. DiMicco","I want you to understand, you should ask the most forward questions first and maybe other people will want to ask some questions. We can go back to your other questions later. But 4 questions at a time is reasonable. So you tell me what your next question is.","Michelle Applebaum - Michelle Applebaum Research Inc.","My next question was, I'm 55, am I going to see you making steel in Louisiana before I retire?","Daniel R. DiMicco","I don't know. When are you going to retire?","Michelle Applebaum - Michelle Applebaum Research Inc.","I don't know, if David has something to say about it -- what?","Daniel R. DiMicco","If you\u2019re going to retire next week, you will not see us making steel in Louisiana. If you are years away from it, it depends on how many years. As we\u2019ve said all along, the strategy for the 4,000-plus acre tract on deepwater port in Louisiana is to include everything, including steelmaking operations, both steel production and downstream. And it's a matter of time. And when it all happens, our first focus is on the raw materials side. But you could see how we've talked about the fact that we're exploring additional greenfield opportunities, and Louisiana may be one of those places that pops up.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Sam Dubinsky with Wells Fargo.","Sam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. Apart from another question on the raw materials business, could you disclose a ballpark figure for the operating income per ton in Q1? And how should we think about profitability for raw materials going forward?","James D. Frias","We don't have an operating income per ton for the raw materials to disclose, and we typically don't.","John J. Ferriola","We don't disclose individual.","Sam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Was it operating at a loss this quarter?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Are you talking about DRI? Are you talking about scrap? Are you talking about overall combination of them?","Sam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, the combination of them.","James D. Frias","Both DRI and scrap were individually profitable.","Daniel R. DiMicco","We don't break out those numbers.","Sam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then -- sorry if I missed this, but you had a tax benefit this quarter, what tax rate should we model going forward?","James D. Frias","If you exclude that adjustment, we'd be at 35%, or 36% if you also exclude the share of profits belonging to our JV partners. So if you make that adjustment, I'd use somewhere in the 35% to 36% range.","Sam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just my last one, I think your steel product lines are flattish year-over-year, but construction spending bounced a little bit in Q1 for the first time. Maybe it was weather driven and maybe it just bounced from the bottom, but could you explain why your steel products maybe wasn't a little stronger? Was it you de-emphasize some products? Or is there something else behind that?","Daniel R. DiMicco","You have to be very careful when you are looking at dollars of construction versus square footage of construction. And there has not been a significant change in the construction activities. On top of that, you are continually in a competitive environment where you have significant overcapacity in virtually every construction products business that we're in, whether it be joist, deck, pre-engineered metal buildings, rebar, fabrication. So you have those -- the situation where there's a lot more growth that's got to come before real pricing power is and margin power is back in the construction product side of the business. So I wouldn't be looking for anything more than that and explain that situation.","Operator","And that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'll turn things back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Yes. Thank you all for your interest in Nucor. For those of you that may not have gotten to ask all of the questions you wanted, feel free to send them in to Gregg Lucas and we'll get you answers. And I wanted to, once again, thank all of our customers for their support, all of our suppliers for taking care of our teammates out on the operations and keeping them well supplied with quality products, and all of our teammates around the corporation for working safely and working effectively. Thank you all very much, and our shareholders and our best years are yet to come. The 470% increase in total return since 2000 is not a thing of the past. It's a thing of the future, and we are building that profit platform to deliver on that as we speak, as we always do during downtimes. And in the meantime, we're paying a nice dividend and we'll continue to do so. So thank you all for your interest in the company.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference call.

And welcome to the Nucor Corporation Third Quarter of 2019 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will come at that time.","Certain statements made during the conference call will be forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The words we expect, believe, anticipate and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify those forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and information that is currently available. Although Nucor believes they are based on reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that future events will not affect their accuracy. More information about the risks and uncertainties relating to these forward-looking statements may be found in Nucor's latest 10-K and subsequently filed 10-Qs, which are available on the SEC's and Nucor's website.","The forward-looking statements made in this conference call speak only as of this date and Nucor does not assume any obligation to update them as either -- either as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Ferriola, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Nucor Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call and for your interest in Nucor. Other members of Nucor's executive team are also on the call today, including Leon Topalian, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Craig Feldman, responsible for Raw Materials; Ladd Hall, responsible for Sheet Products; Ray Napolitan, responsible for Engineered Bar Products; MaryEmily Slate, responsible for Plate, Structural and Tubular Products; Dave Sumoski, responsible for Merchant Bar and Rebar Products; and Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated Construction products.","Last month, I announced my retirement from Nucor, effective at the end of this year. One of my priorities during my time as CEO has been to make certain that we had a deep bench of leadership talent and a robust management succession plan in place. I know we have succeeded on both fronts. Identifying the right leaders is a key component of our Company's future success. I'm delighted that the Nucor Board of Directors has selected Leon Topalian to succeed me as Nucor's next CEO.","Leon has proven himself to be an exceptional leader throughout his 23-year career at Nucor. Since 2017, he has served as Executive Vice President, responsible for Nucor's Plate and structural steel mills. Prior to joining our corporate senior leadership, Leon was General Manager at two facilities: our Nucor-Yamato structural steel mill and our Kankakee, Illinois, bar mill. With the support of our leadership team and all of our team mates, I'm confident that Leon will guide Nucor towards continued success. I'm also confident that we have an executive leadership team that is second to none in our industry, and I know, Leon and the Board feel the same way.","Before I provide comments on our third quarter results, I want to say a few words about safety. One of my proudest accomplishments during my time as CEO, is the way that our entire organization has improved our safety performance. I want to thank all of my team mates for your constant focus on working safely. We are having one of our best years ever for safety performance. Let's keep that focus as we move closer to our goal, which will always be zero incidents at every Nucor facility. Any injury is one too many.","Now onto our third quarter results. We saw continued strong performance from our metal buildings, piling, joist and deck divisions, as well as improved performance in our rebar fabrication divisions. The performance reflects excellent execution by our team mates and continued stable conditions in the non-residential construction market. Overall spending in a non-residential construction market, which typically accounts for approximately one-half of our Company's shipments, remains at healthy levels.","After a brief summer rally, plate and sheet market conditions softened in the third quarter. Excess inventory throughout the supply chain has resulted in continued destocking by our customers. Service center industry data indicates that inventories remain low. In addition, our OEM customers have become cautious about buying as we head into the year end. However, we do believe that both our service center and OEM customers will start restocking to meet demand as 2020 gets underway.","Looking out further into next year, the pending 2020 elections, and current trade issues such as the unresolved status of the USMCA agreement for North America are creating some more uncertainty in the market. While it's difficult to predict steel markets that far into the future, we continue to have great confidence in Nucor's business fundamentals and our long-term strategy.","Finally, let me remind you all that we have several more of our growth projects starting up in the fourth quarter that will give us the capability to produce more of the products that our customers are asking us to make. And we have said many times, these investments position us for continued success by taking advantage of specific market opportunities. We expect they will further enhance Nucor's position as a steel market leader.","I'm now going to turn the call over to Leon to provide comments and an update on several of our growth initiatives. Leon?","Leon Topalian","Thanks, John. I'd like to begin by saying how honored I am to have the opportunity to lead this amazing company. I look forward to continuing the proud traditions that have made Nucor, the premier steel and steel products company for the last 50 years. A hallmark of our success has and will continue to be our culture, which begins with a nearly 27,000 team members who make up the Nucor family. Our culture drew me to this company 23 years ago and it inspires me daily. And the most important value in our culture is safety. Taking care of our team is the most important responsibility we have. I take it very personally and will work tirelessly to continue Nucor's quest of becoming the safest steel company in the world.","Since the announcement, I have been visiting many of our divisions and have been humbled by the warm reception I've received. In talking with our team, it's obvious, they are deeply engaged in our mission and just as excited about Nucor's future as I am. That excitement is especially evident among our team members who are bringing new growth projects online. Let me just say, thank you for your hard work, dedication, commitment and never losing sight of our most important value, safety.","I would like now to provide you with an update on some of the projects we're bringing online. At Nucor Steel Arkansas, our Hickman team continues to increase production and improve yield performance on our new specialty cold mill. The mill's flexibility is a key feature with its dual configuration, Hickman's new cold mill can change from a high reduction mill for the advanced strength steels of the future to a very efficient four-high mill in just six minutes. This flexibility separates us from our competition and allows us to efficiently offer a broader range of value-added products. There is no other carbon mill like this in North America.","Nucor Steel Gallatin's new galvanizing line team coated their first coils on September 27 with 500,000 tons of annual capacity, Gallatin's 72-inch galvanizing line is the widest hot-rolled galvanizing facility in North America. Gallatin is extremely well positioned to grow Nucor's share of the underserved Midwest heavy-gauge galvanizing hot-band market.","At our Marion, Ohio rebar mill, commissioning of the new in line rolling mill was completed in August and the Marion team is currently ramping up production. Early next year, Marion will also install quench and temper equipment to reduce alloy costs. These investments combined with a more energy efficient reheat furnace installed last year will position Marion as a low-cost producer in the region.","Other projects on track for start-up by the end of the year include, Nucor Steel Kankakee's MBQ rolling mill, our new rebar micro mill in Sedalia, Missouri and the galvanizing line we're building in Mexico with JFE Steel. As we have said before, we are not adding capacity simply to get bigger. These projects target defined market opportunities where we are confident that we will compete and win highly profitable market share.","We are also responding to feedback from our customers regarding their product needs, particularly for value-added products. Nucor is doing more than adding capacity. Nucor is increasing their capabilities to provide our customers with superior value. We achieved that with unique product properties, unmatched product breadth, industry-leading on-time delivery and unrivaled quality. Every growth project we are implementing builds on our competitive strengths to serve new product and geographic markets.","With these investments, we are increasing Nucor's long-term earnings power. This is the same strategy Nucor has successfully executed through numerous market cycles over the past five decades.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Frias for a review of our financial results. Jim?","James Frias","Thanks, Leon. Nucor reported third quarter of 2019 earnings of $0.90 per diluted share. These results exceeded our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.80 due to better-than-expected performance at our sheet and bar steel mills as well as from several steel products businesses, most notably joist, deck and building systems. It's worth noting that both our joist and deck business and our metal buildings business are on pace for a record year in 2019. Both of these business groups are benefiting from lower steel prices and excellent commercial execution. The metal buildings business is also benefiting from a restructuring that is realign capacity and reduced fixed costs.","Earnings from our steel mills segment were lower than the second quarter due to declining metal margins. Sheet and plate products experienced the greatest pricing pressure, as customer destocking continued in the third quarter. Total steel mills shipments in the third quarter were comparable to the second quarter. Steel mills shipments to internal customers represented 21% of total steel mills shipments in the third quarter, an increase from 19% in the second quarter. Nucor's downstream channels to market strategy remains a key competitive strength of our company.","Earnings from our steel products segment improved compared to the second quarter of this year and to the year ago third quarter. Non-residential construction market conditions remain positive. Our businesses appear to have benefited from both the recovery from weather-related disruptions earlier in the year and seasonally stronger construction months.","Results from our raw materials segment decreased compared to the second quarter due to further margin compression at our direct reduced iron or DRI operations. In addition, our Louisiana DRI facility began its planned outage in early September, and that is expected to continue until mid-November.","Our third quarter results included roughly $28 million of pre-operating and start-up costs related to strategic investment projects, compared with approximately $21 million in the second quarter of 2019 and approximately $11 million in the year ago quarter. First nine months of 2019 cash provided from operations was approximately $2.1 billion, up from about $1.9 billion for the year-ago period. Nucor continues to benefit from its highly variable cost structure, accounts receivable, payables and inventory were a source of approximately $500 million during the first nine months of 2019, reflecting consistent working capital management in a declining steel pricing environment.","Capital expenditures totaled $985 million through the first nine months of 2019. Our full year 2019 capital spending budget is now approximately $1.5 billion, a decrease from our prior forecast of $1.8 billion. This change reflects the timing of expected outlays over the balance of this year. Cash returned to shareholders during the first nine months of 2019 totaled $567 million. We paid dividends of $369 million and stock repurchases totaled $198 million. Thus far in 2019, we have returned 49% of our net income to our shareholders, while also investing for long-term profitable growth.","Nucor's financial condition remains strong. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. With total debt outstanding of approximately $4.3 billion, our gross debt to capital ratio was 28% at the end of the third quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April 2023. Our next material debt maturity is in 2022 for approximately $600 million.","Now turning to the outlook. Nucor's earnings in the fourth quarter of 2019 are expected to be lower than the third quarter. While non-residential construction markets remain broadly stable and healthy, manufacturing sector activity has slowed down. We expect earnings in the steel mills segment to further decrease from the third quarter due to the impact of lower steel prices at the end of the third quarter, which will be realized in the fourth quarter shipments. We believe steel prices have bottomed. The profitability of the steel products segment is expected to decrease slightly due to normal year-end seasonality. The performance of our raw materials segment is expected to decline in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter due to the impact of our Louisiana DRI plant's outage continuing until mid-November, as well as further margin pressure throughout our raw materials businesses.","Thank you for your interest in our company. I will now turn the call back over to John.","John Ferriola","Thanks, Jim. Before we take your questions, let me make a few other comments. I recently had the privilege of joining the Nucor Steel Indiana team to celebrate 30 years of making steel in Crawfordsville. Three decades ago, our team revolutionized the American steel industry, becoming the first in-slab operation to produce sheet steel using an electric arc furnace. 600 people joined us for the celebration, including local officials, team mates, customers, suppliers and friends and family. Congratulations again to the Crawfordsville team for all they have accomplished over the past 30 years.","With regard to trade policy, imports continue to supply a shrinking share of the US demand, thanks to the cost competitiveness of our market-oriented domestic steel industry and effective trade enforcement. At Nucor, we will not take this progress for granted, and we will continue to press for sensible legislation, regulation and enforcement. We also remain hopeful that Congress will approve the USMCA this year. We see it as a meaningful modernization of NAFTA that will benefit the US economy and the domestic manufacturing sector in particular.","We would now be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Martin Englert with Jefferies.","Martin Englert","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon.","Martin Englert","Downstream steel products results were fairly strong this quarter. I just wanted to see if you can provide an update on the efficiency initiatives, if there is more to expect there, as well as the rebar fabrication business, was it profitable. And also how those backlogs look compared to a year ago and how you see the non-resi construction moving forward?","John Ferriola","Let me start with some comments on the business model changes that we've made in our building systems and in our Vulcraft operations. I'm really proud of the job that the team has done and we've always said that we have great team mates in those operations that working in a model that needed to be adjusted.","We are making the adjustments and we're seeing very positive results. Is there more to go or we always want to get better, we always said that we can do better tomorrow more than we are doing today. And I'm confident that as we gain more experience with the new models that we will continue to see improvements in those operations. Chad, do you want to add anything to that?","D. Chad Utermark","Yeah. Thanks, John. Just a couple of comments. So our joist and deck, metal buildings and rebar fabrication backlogs are slightly improved year-over-year. These end use markets are led by warehouse manufacturing and commercial projects and we see them sustainable into the first quarter of 2020.","So overall, yes, we\u2019re very excited about the performance of our downstream product groups and look forward as we head into 2020.","John Ferriola","Leon, do you want to add some?","Leon Topalian","Yes, I just agree with Chad's comments - and one thing I\u2019d add just on backlogs, I\u2019d tell you our backlogs in the non-resi within the rebar fabrication are strong and we continue to reduce - we're moving waste in inventory through that channel.","A - James Frias","Yes, this question was about profitability in rebar fab, we did make money in the rebar fab in this quarter for sure.","John Ferriola","And maybe to just add that up, I\u2019d like to say thank you to our team mates in all of those operations making changes like this. These are not easy to do and the support that we've got from our team mates in all of those operations is what resulted in the success that we've seen as we've made these business decisions.","So thank you all for the hard work, thank you for your willingness to adjust to a changing marketplace and more to come.","Martin Englert","Okay. Again, nice results there and also within the release, you did highlight that you believe steel prices have bottomed, can you discuss what factors you're seeing in today's market that suggest support of current steel prices and perhaps your near-term view on the scrap market?","John Ferriola","Speaking in general terms across all of our products without getting into specifics, we do feel that in many of our products, the pricing has bottomed. The things that drive that are a couple of things.","Number one, you are right, we see the scrap market starting to improve. We anticipate that the scrap pricing will go up about $20 maybe next month, $25 somewhere in that neighborhood, and we think that, that trend will continue throughout the year. Our best guess on scrap pricing right now for the year is up $20 to $40 by the end of the year.","And the other thing that I would say that's driving our belief is that when we start to look at our bookings, particularly in our sheet area, over the last several weeks, bookings have improved and we see more energy, and particularly in the hot-band. Cold roll and galvanizing has always been fairly strong. We haven't seen much of a decline in those two products, but hot-band as you know, was really a challenge for the first part of this year.","We\u2019ve talked about this in the past, overstocking of inventories last year, the tough weather conditions at the beginning of this year, destocking this year, these are all things that have contributed to challenging steel market during this year. We see that ending. When we look at MSCI inventories, we see them - I mean, they are incredibly low levels and the lowest that we've seen in many, many years. And compared to last year, they down at this time -- same time last year, they down fairly significantly.","So these are all things that we see driving comments that we think that the pricing as well as the volumes will increase as we go forward. One more point that I would make is, Leon, do you want to say something?","Leon Topalian","Sure. Well, Martin, the MSCI numbers, as John pointed out, are down roughly 14% to 20% year-over-year. And so if you look at that compared to the peak, which occurred in the 2015 to 2016 range, it's almost over 20% down compared to that point. So again, year-over-year, we're approximately 14% to 20% across all of our points.","Additionally, as we enter the first quarter, particularly in sheet, we anticipate that being and usually is a much stronger quarter as we begin the year and we look forward to that as we enter the next quarter.","John Ferriola","So as we turn over the New Year, we see business getting better across all of our products, as we said, I think Ted pointed out, we had records in many of our downstream businesses. We anticipate another strong year going into with our downstream business next year. We see improving conditions going into the new year in our steel products.","Martin Englert","Okay. Thanks very much for all that detail on color and congratulations on the results in a difficult environment.","John Ferriola","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs.","Hunter Alley","Hi. This is Hunter Alley on for Matthew Korn. We noticed in your reporting that you [indiscernible] raw materials and other steel product shipments, we're wondering if you discuss what is the reason for the split in the reporting. And can you discuss what products are going to be included in both of those buckets?","John Ferriola","The decision to split up more detail was just in response to quest for more information from investors and the breakdown of the other bucket, what's in the other bucket? Metal buildings is in the other bucket and faster is in the other bucket. Is Skyline\u2026","Leon Topalian","Cold finished.","John Ferriola","Yes, cold finished. So there is a few different businesses in the other buckets. We took the largest businesses and broken out.","John Ferriola","I believe the request by some investors came into some of these calls - it could have also been an offline discussion as well.","Hunter Alley","Okay, okay. Great. Thank you very much. And then on - we noticed that our structural and plate shipments have both been weaker over year, while tubular has been stronger, can you discuss the trends that you're seeing in any markets and if there's anything specific driving changes at Nucor?","John Ferriola","Well, I\u2019ll start with structural and maybe we'll turn it over to MaryEmily Slate to talk about -- make some comments on tubular. Structural business has been challenged this year. No doubt about it, a lot of it was a result of heavy stocking last year, particularly in the last half of last year and we saw service centers are stocking up pretty heavily and then of course at the beginning of this year, as I mentioned earlier, weather conditions prohibited a lot of the construction from consuming some of that overstocking and we've been going through a destocking period now.","I would comment that we think that we're seeing the bottom of that stocking, destocking now is coming to an end and we expect that to pick up a little bit. We also expect to see some benefit from the recent determinations by commerce on fabricated structural steel and we had some very positive preliminary determinations, we are looking forward to some final also positive determinations early part of next year. So those were some of the things that are driving where we were and why we feel, things are going to get better. And Emily, do want to comment on tubular?","MaryEmily Slate","Absolutely. On tubular products, the OEM and fabricator activity has not been bad this year, it has been pretty stable. But we've also experienced some destocking and people bringing their inventories to lower levels. We feel that, that product group though has seen the lowest levels of inventory, and we'll start with more normal buying patterns here in fourth quarter.","So we expect things to get a little bit better. There is also some really good project activity out there that we've been very successful in getting. So, we will look to a bright future.","James Frias","And John, one other point I'd add and Hunter, you asked about the trends in beams, one of the things I would share with you is, being a market leader in beams, we've -- it's been one of our most profitable groups and as you've seen and that we've reported, while the utilization rates are in that 65 to 70 range, because of our market leadership position, we've been able to maintain a very profitable position in this market and serve our customers' needs while continue to expand our products and our offerings like the grade 65 quench and temper beams to our construction -- customers and supply the needs that they're asking us for.","Hunter Alley","That's very helpful. Thank you all for the additional color.","John Ferriola","Welcome.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Terry","Hi, Jim. Couple of questions from my side. All the best, John, in retirement. Just firstly on your capital for the quarter, noticed you didn't do anything on the buyback. So I just wonder if you could provide a little bit more color on that. I appreciate you've got a 40% minimum payout ratio and you've already met that I think you commented at 49%.","But just a little bit surprised when you've held back a little bit on the capital timing that there was no buyback in the quarter? Thanks.","James Frias","Yes, thanks for that question. We've got a very intentional process for how we think about returning capital to investors as well as invest in our business, of course, our capital allocation. Mindset begins with the idea that we want to invest in strategic long-term growth and of course we do have a number of projects in our pipeline.","And as you kind of noted, we're a little behind in terms of the spending on some of those capital projects, so that's resulted in us temporarily having more cash in the balance sheet. That's going to catch up pretty quickly over the next six to nine months and we're going to need that cash -- some of that cash to fund a lot of the capital projects that are in process.","With separate from that, as we think about returning capital to investors, we begin with this idea that we want to return a minimum of 40% of our earnings and then we also want to maintain a debt to capital ratio that supports our strong investment grade credit rating. And in times when that debt-to-capital ratio becomes too low, we will return more like we did late last year when we have a view that we have depth of liquidity.","And so it's possible, we'll do more before the end of the year, but it depends on our forecast of cash going into 2020, because working capital has benefited us to the tune of roughly $0.5 billion this year. If steel prices reverse and scrap prices reverse, we're going to need - we're going to have some use of cash in working capital next year.","We definitely will see an acceleration in capital spending. So we're being thoughtful about not just where we stand with cash today, but where we expect cash to be through the next year.","Chris Terry","Okay. Thanks for the color on that. And just in terms of the corporate eliminations, it's quite a bit lower than what we expected for the quarter. I appreciate that the steel mills profitability obviously has an impact on what that number would be. Can you just talk a little bit about some of the one-offs in that and the difficulty in the forecast against that number? Thanks.","James Frias","Yes, I'm going to answer two questions, one you're not asking, but it's sort of related. SG&A and marketing, admin is also dramatically lower. So the piece that's reflected in both places is incentive compensation. Incentive compensation in the quarter is about $88 million less this year than last year, year-to-date, it's about $140 million [ph] less. And that's affecting both the elims line and the marketing, admin and other line. So -- and that's just because we're making less money. The biggest piece of that profit sharing is what we set aside for employees below the level of Vice President.","And then additionally, we have the profit elimination this year in the third quarter was a benefit of about $34 million, last year was an expense of about $67 million. So as margins and steel fall, we revalue that inventory. We can sometimes get a benefit from inter-company eliminations.","So we got a benefit in the third quarter this year. Year-to-date, that benefit is about $91 million and last year, the expense was about $228 million. So, that's been a pretty severe swing as well. Those are the two biggest factors affecting the change in elims and the incentive comp is the biggest factor affecting SG&A.","Chris Terry","Thanks for that. And the last one from me just in terms of the end markets, you've spoken about, most of them, but I just wondered if you could comment on the auto sector specifically? And maybe just I think you normally give color on your 24 end markets, maybe just where they're tracking? Thanks.","John Ferriola","I will start with the second question first. And just as a general statement, we feel that about two-thirds of the markets that we serve are either stable or growing somewhere around 60% to 65% of them, and that feels about right for us given the conditions out there in the economy. Your question about automotive, certainly, the automotive market has edged down forecasting somewhere around 16.8 - 16.9 [ph], I heard just the other day almost 17 [ph].","So it's down a little bit from last year for certain, but still 16.8, 16.9, those are pretty good numbers and the important I think -- important thing to note for us is that we continue to take a bigger share of that smaller pie. If you look at the tonnage that we sent into the automotive business this year compared to last year, we're up about 15% constant into automotive this year as compared to last year.","So we continue to grow our market share and although the pie is shrinking, we continue to get a bigger piece of that smaller pie. We feel real good about where we are in automotive. We are confident that we'll continue to grow and we look at next year we are projecting for 2020 and 2021 even more tonnage going into those markets.","Chris Terry","Thanks very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Seth Rosenfeld with Exane BNP.","Seth Rosenfeld","Good afternoon. Seth Rosenfeld from Exane BNP. A couple of questions please on the long product market. Obviously, we've seen a significant decline in bar prices over the last several months. The metal spreads appear to be holding up much better and rebar and other bar products and for sheet, can you comment a bit more about what you see is driving this relative outperformance for long products, how sustainable that is going into 2020? You already commented a bit on the demand side but from a broader supply demand perspective?","And then separately, as you are nearing or beginning to ramp up two new rebar micro mills, what's your thought on this pie demand balance within the region right now? There been some news in recent weeks that one of your competitors is shutting down one of their domestic rebar EAF. Do you think that the market can stomach increased capacity or will other higher cost mills be pushed out in the coming year? Thank you.","John Ferriola","Well, let me start with your first question talking about our long products and the metal margins performing better than some of our other flat rolled products. So, clearly the demand in our long products is better. There was a less of a destocking issue with our long products particularly when you talk about rebar, we have less of an issue with rebar than we did in our sheet products or on our plate products, a little bit more on merchant, but not significantly more.","So demand was strong, inventories had loaded to the level that data in on flat products last year. And a lot of our loan products obviously go into construction and construction has been relatively strong. A lot of our long products merchant and rebar go into our downstream businesses.","As Jim mentioned in his comments internally, we're shipping about 20% of our steel products downstream a lot of that is long products going into our building systems in particular Vulcraft in Harris [ph] operations and they have been strong. So all of those kind of lead into that.","Now having said all of that, when we talk about long products and talking about structural, certainly, an infrastructure build will continue to help with us with that. We continue to encourage the administration to get going on something that badly needed in this country, they will infrastructure bill. So, that's a little bit about the long products.","Now in terms of the -- your comment or your question about on micro mills regionally and the demand or the supply-demand ratio in the areas where we're building, we still feel very good about that. We've talked about in the past about the regional nature of these micro mills. We're not going to comment on any of our competitors shutting down or anything like that.","We believe that the two things that are going to really give us an advantage with the micro mills are we're right in the heart of the marketplace. We've got great scrap availability for those mills. The design of the mills provide for extremely low cost structure, highly efficient close to the supply of the raw material and close to the marketplace. Those are things that we feel will make this very successful. Dave, you want to add something?","David Sumoski","Yeah. If we would comment on some of the competition shedding down, we would correct you, it's an MBQ product that's exiting the market, not the rebar.","Seth Rosenfeld","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","John Ferriola","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners","Yeah. Hi, good afternoon.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon.","Timna Tanners","I think this may be John's last conference call, so I want to wish you well on your next chapter and thanks for all your candor over the years. We appreciate it.","John Ferriola","Thank you, Timna.","Timna Tanners","Yes, sir. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the CapEx change, because even up until last conference call, you're just saying it would be heavily weighted in the second half. So something changed and I know you say it's timing, but does this mean that you're pushing more CapEx into next year?","Can you give us a little more thoughts into next year and if conditions remained somewhat sluggish, could you rethink some of the CapEx and the projects? Thanks.","James Frias","Yes. So we rely a lot on the divisions to help us forecast when CapEx is going to happen and there's a lot of variables go into spending money and capital project begins with permitting, there's an engineering design process, there is a quotation process, there is lead times and getting equipment delivered and there's installation until products are in weather effects thing.","So until things are delivered, whether it's a service or product to the site, we can't actually count it as CapEx and pay for it. So some things happen behind what we hope to accomplish this year, but by and large, we still expect it to days we've committed to in terms of start with facilities.","We're probably a little bit more concerned that our commitment for start-up dates than we are on the CapEx spending side. And yes, we will spend some money that we plan to spend this year, next year. So in January, we'll come out and give you a budget for 2020. But, I would expect it to be notably higher than what we're actually going to spend in 2019, partly because of the carryover from 2019.","John Ferriola","Timna, I do want to make a comment about the second part of that question, I want to be really empathic about this, okay? Listen, we're not reacting to any changes in the market. We're in a cyclical business. We don't react. We don't change on our strategic plan based upon changes in the marketplace. In fact, if anything, we would just the opposite of what you say, we tend to invest more and will focus on growing our company during the downturns, that's always been our philosophy.","We invest in the downturns, to come back into the upturn stronger when talk about having higher-highs and higher-lows. So I want to be really clear about this, there has nothing to do with the change in the market dynamics at this time. We don't react. Our strategic plan is built for the long-term. We don't react. Short-term changes in the market do not impact our strategic initiatives.","James Frias","John, I agree with everything and the other thing I'd add, Timna just very briefly is, we understand our markets and where we serve them we listen to our customers and where they need us to be not just today, but for the long-term to provide a competitive differentiated value proposition and that's really where our investments and so to John's point if we got [indiscernible] by every shift in the market, I'm not sure, would be the industry leader in the steel making industry in North America than we are today.","John Ferriola","And just build on that for a minute, Timna, but certainly if we didn't invest and grow our company during the last recession, we would not have seen the record year that we had in 2018. So it's the work that we do during those downturns that allow us to have the record years and we'll continue to do that.","Timna Tanners","Okay. Fair enough. I guess I struck a chord. But so not taking your strategic view. So you don't change your strategic view given market conditions, but just commercially and just looking at volumes, I'm still kind of in shock when I look at the year-over-year trends, if we kind of continue the recent volume trends in long products, and across the board, I mean, volumes are pretty significantly down.","Just wondering, seasonally things improve, I get it, but even on an annualized basis, is there anything you can help us high level to understand that could explain reasons for a shift upward in bar structural plate just because it has been such a dramatic drop from 2018 and even from 2017, to be fair?","So just wondering if there is a commercial shift you've made to maybe shift-less in a soft market, is there a reason that these volume I can rebound or how do we think about it?","John Ferriola","No, it has not. We made no commercial decision to change our sales or shipping strategy based upon the conditions in the market breaks, none at all. I want to be clear about that. We've talked a lot about the stocking and destocking that we've gone through and most of our discussions have focused on the service center industry.","But bear in mind that across all of our products, we saw this issue of overstocking at the end of 2018, also in the downstream businesses, the downstream customers, you talk about on some of the flat products and on the plate products, some of our large equipment manufacturing customers, I don't want to name any of them specifically, but we know for a fact that their inventories are up, their inventories are up at their plant sites and the dealers and even in some absolutely storage location.","So it's primarily - we still feel very strongly, primarily an issue of stocking and destocking. We think that if you look at pure demand, we think demand is solid and they would have down by about 3% or 4%. Certainly, the volumes have not reflect that.","They are more significant in that. So, we still believe strongly that was looking at an issue of stocking and destocking that we continue to work our way through, we will come through this and we'll get back to more normalized inventory levels and more normalized booking and shipping levels.","Timna Tanners","Okay. Thank you.","John Ferriola","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Phil Gibbs","Hey. Good afternoon.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon.","Phil Gibbs","Okay. I was just wondering if you can hear me, okay. In terms of the rebar investment at Marion, I think Leon was discussing that, I know it was an upgrade specifically to your rolling mill, curious if that impeded in your productivity or output at that mill all those upgrades are taking place?","John Ferriola","Let me kick it off and I'll turn it over to Dave or to Leon to add to it, but the short answer is no, okay. The team has done an outstanding job of making the modifications to improve our quality and our efficiency and productivity at those mills, while at the same time continuing to provide quality products to our customers.","The other point that I would like to make again thanking the team, we had a great safety record during this rebuild and whenever you're modifying an existing mill and continuing to run that mill, while you're making those improvements to it, it can be challenging from a safety perspective.","The team did an outstanding job on getting the project done on-time, on-budget and most importantly, without any major accidents. So, I thank you for that. Anything that you want to add, Dave?","David Sumoski","I just want to add on top of that, thanks to the team at Marion for the outage that they did safely, 30-day outage and we did not disrupt anything from a customer standpoint, and you guys did it safely. So, thank you and I appreciate that.","Phil Gibbs","Great. I appreciate that and a question more on the raw material segment. A lot of headwinds right now, they seem to be numerous, curious in your mind, which out of these headwinds that you're seeing right now are transitory and maybe which are structural.","We certainly didn't expect to see the results as negative as they were in the third quarter and getting more negative. And then just as a sub-question, I wonder the DRI investments that you're making come to a conclusion and then maybe remind us of the magnitude of those investments?","John Ferriola","So a bunch of questions there. Okay. Let me start with the end and I'll work my way backwards the projects that our Louisiana plan, we will wrap up -- scheduled to wrap up on November 14. And we look like at this point, we believe we are on time. We believe we are on schedule and, excuse me, on budget. So things are looking pretty good at Louisiana.","Just as a reminder, there was two major things that we're attacking three to altogether with two major ones. One is in the handling out, how we manage the feeding of the raw materials storage and feeding into the furnace and that's gone particularly well. We think that's going to have a major impact on the productivity of that operation and we also -- we placed the aligning in the vessel.","And as you might recall, we had met numerous major problems with the process gas heater and of course, we have basically replacing the entire process gas heater with a design that we have a great deal of confidence in. All of these changes would not to increase the productivity, reduce our cost in that operation, it's called Project 8,000 for a reason.","The reason being that we wanted to be able to get up to 8,000 hours of operation. We believe that we'll be able to accomplish that next year, if we do and let me rephrase that, when we do, we will have the result of about 2.2 metric tons production -- 2.2 million metric tons out of that operation, which would put it in terms of hours of operation on par with Trinidad facility, which did just under 8,000 hours of operation last year. So, I don't remember what was the total cost of the project that was combined\u2026","David Sumoski","It was roughly $200 million.","John Ferriola","Roughly $200 million.","David Sumoski","And I guess the other question, Phil, you asked was with regard to the timing of these projects. The two main projects right now, the refractory and the PGA changes will be done in the next three weeks as we come up mid-November. And then the ore yard will be finalized middle of next year.","James Frias","Phil, some comments on your questions on the timing of these things in terms of what's temporary, what's permanent. Obviously, we're going to get a cost benefit from these investments, we're taking a cost penalty in pre-operating startup costs in the third quarter related to these investments and that will be done after the fourth quarter.","But the part we are - margins are compressed in both the DRI business and in the scrap business that's part of the cycle of the business when prices are low for iron -- for pig iron, we have to sell DRI to ourselves at a low price and if iron ore prices don't go down enough, it puts a squeeze in our margins. So that's a cyclical business, like all of our businesses, and right now, it feels like it set a bottom of the cycle and they need to get better.","John Ferriola","And remember, it\u2019s kind of a hedge. This is kind of a good news\/bad news thing when we talk about our raw material business struggling. What it means is, as Jim pointed out, it means that scrap is at a low level, pig iron is at a low level and we consume a tremendous amount of scrap and a tremendous amount of pig iron.","So it's a good news\/bad news situation, it's kind of when we built this, we talked about it being a hedging operation and build particularly to put -- to kind of help put a cap on the upward movement of scrap, particularly prime scrap during really good markets and we saw that happen in 2018 and accomplished what it was meant to accomplish in 2018.","Phil Gibbs","Thanks very much.","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. John, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","John Ferriola","Thank you, Kathy. Before we end today's call, I'd like to take a few moments to thank you for your interest in our company. For the past seven years as CEO, I have truly enjoyed participating in these calls and I always enjoy talking about Nucor's successes. It's been a pleasure to have you all as an audience. Thank you.","I also want to offer my appreciation to our investors for entrusting Nucor with your valuable capital and to our customers for entrusting us with your business. We truly appreciate the business you give to us. It's been a pleasure to work together with my team mates to serve all of you during my three decades with Nucor.","And speaking of my team mates, I always give, I often give the following advice, successful people surround themselves with great teams. If you want to be successful, you need to have the right people in the right positions on your team. I have been fortunate to always have the right people around me at Nucor, including the team on this call today.","A strong leadership team we have built over the last decade, we will ensure that we have a deep bench of talent to draw upon for years to come. They have worked with me to achieve a number of accomplishments, which I am very proud of, a strong record of safety; the rollout of digital tools to better connect with; and serve our customers; the execution on our five drivers of profitable growth, including our greater penetration of the automotive market, while significantly expanded channels to market and our new rebar micro mills, as well as Nucor's evolution into a company that is more intensely focused on commercial excellence and building powerful strategic partnerships with our customers.","I want to thank all of our Nucor team mates for the hard work that they have done during my tenure to achieve these successes and for the hard work that I know they will continue to do each and every day into the future to build a safer and more profitable Nucor. 2020 is going to be another exciting year for our company. When we asked Leon to join the executive team, I knew Nucor is bringing a strong leader to Charlotte. I have known Leon for years and I've been proud to call him a team mate.","I\u2019ve watched how he has met the challenges head on, preparing him for the role into which he now steps. And let me tell you something, I know that Leon and the great team around him will ensure that Nucor continues to be an industry leader well into the future. I'm excited to see where Leon and the team takes our company next.","At Nucor, we believe that we are never as good today as we are going to be tomorrow. There is always an opportunity to be better. I leave you all in a very capable hands. We are confident than ever that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us.","Thank you again for what you do for Nucor every day and to my team mates, thank you again, particularly for doing it safely. Please never forget, there is nothing more important than safety, absolutely nothing. Thank you for your interest in our company. Have a great day.","Operator","And that concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will come at that time.","Certain statements made during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Please go ahead, sir.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today\u2019s call are the other members of Nucor\u2019s senior management team: Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman, Dave Sumoski, and Chad Utermark.","The entire executive management team would like to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit, Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for working hard, working smart, working together and most importantly working safety to take care of our customers in the first quarter of 2015.","The current steel industry challenges of significance whether it's a short-term challenge such as energy and industry turbulence or a structural challenge such as excess global steel capacity and Nucor team always runs totally with the challenge not away from it. We address the challenges we face head on. Times of adversity allows demonstrating to strength of Nucor\u2019s business model with our unreliable competitive advantage and the adaptability Nucor grow stronger during periods of industry distress. Achieving that goal is the unrelenting focus of more than 23,000 Nucor team mates each day as they continue their excellent work implementing our company strategy for long-term profitable growth.","I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to review Nucor\u2019s first quarter performance and financial position. Following Jim's comments, I will update you on current market conditions and execution of our strategy for the long-term profitable growth. Jim?","James Frias","Thanks, John. First quarter of 2015 earnings of $0.21 per diluted share compared favorably against fourth quarter of 2014 earnings of $0.65 per diluted share and year ago first quarter earnings of $0.35 per diluted share. The profitability of our steel segment for the first quarter of 2015 declined approximately 46%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. An unprecedented level of imports flooding the domestic market in late '14 and early 2015 has pressured steel selling prices margins and volumes for all of our steel mill products. The hard rolled sheet market is the weakest as a result of the combined impact of surging imports and severe inventory correction underway in the energy pipe and tube sector.","Capacity utilization in our steelmaking operations fell to 65% of the first quarter of 2015 from the fourth quarter's rate of 76%. Not surprisingly our sheet mills experienced the largest decline quarter-over-quarter in production and shipments.","New core sheet mill shipments decreased 14% over this period, which compared to an 8% decline in total steel mill shipments. Steel mill profitability was also impacted by continued erosion in selling prices that outpaced decreases in raw material costs. A decline in steel selling prices exceeded the reduction in our composite scrap and scrap usage cost which were $39 per ton quarter-over-quarter.","Average sales prices dropped $70 per ton per plate, $67 per ton per beams and $49 per ton per sheet. The first quarter of 2015 performance of the raw material segment includes an operating loss of approximately $44 million or $0.09 per diluted share at our new DRI facility in Louisiana. That is larger than the approximately $35 million operating loss. The Newport steel, Louisiana experienced in the fourth quarter. Our Louisiana team has completed repairs and the adjustments of the process gas heater that failed the November of last year. Operations resumed during the last week of the first quarter.","On the positive side, our downstream product segment continues to capitalize in the slow but steady growth underway in non-residential construction markets. As expected this segment's first quarter profitability decreased from the fourth quarter level due to typical seasonal factors. However compared with the year ago quarter, segment pretax profitability increased to more than $32 million from less than $2 million. Particularly strong profit improvement was achieved in our joist and decking and metal building systems businesses.","A quick comment about our tax rates which can be confusing due to the impact of profits from non-controlling interests. After adjusting our profits belonging to our business partners the effective tax rate was 33.9% for the first quarter. Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the first quarter. Cash and short term investments totaled $1.3 million including our net debt-to-capital ratio at approximately 28%. Our net significant debt maturity is not until December 2017. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which remains undrawn it still does not mature until August of 2018. Nucor is the only North America's steel produce to hold the investment grade credit rating.","Nucor continues to generate very robust operating cash flow throughout the cyclical up and downs that characterize the steel business. With our highly variable cost structure we benefit from significant reductions in working capital during downturns. That was the case again in the first quarter of 2015 with cash provided by operations of $564 million a dramatic increase from the year ago first quarter. Our strong cash flow will obviously increase our liquidity and retire the year end to 2014 commercial paper balance of about $150 million that have been issued to fund the portion of Gallatin Steel acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year.","First quarter of 2015 capital expenditures totaled $70 million. We continue to estimate full year 2015 capital spending will be approximately $500 million. Most of our recent largest scale growth projects have been completed or near in completion. Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to total about $700 million.","John made an excellent point about the strength of Nucor's business model. It is one that enjoys competitive advantages and a degree of flexibility that cannot be matched by any of our competitors in the North American steel industry. Nucor's strong balance sheet consistently healthy cash flow generation and conservative financial practices are critical components of our business model. Times of adversity such as what our industry is currently undergoing once again highlight the strength and value of Nucor significant competitive advantages and superior adaptability. Our focus is not on survival but growing stronger.","Earnings in the first quarter of 2015 are expected to be somewhat improved from the first quarter. The second quarter should be followed by further improvement in the second half of 2015 given the ongoing strength of non-residential construction and its impact on our steel mills and downstream businesses. Non-residential construction activity accounts for more than half of end used demand for our products.","Margin in the steel mill segment are expected to improve although we will not realize the full benefits of lower raw material cost until there is a greater stability in steel pricing. As service center destocking runs its course during this transaction period steel prices are expected to stabilize and rebound.","Second quarter performance at a raw material segment will reflect continued high losses at the Louisiana, DRI facility and the impact of a nearly completed one month maintenance outage at our DRI facility in Trinidad. The Louisiana plant has resumed production and it will be consuming higher cost iron ore that was on hand when the plant suspended operations following a failure in its process gas heater in early November.","Our steel product segment is expected to achieve continued improvement in profitability during the second quarter. All three major fabricated construction products joist and decking, fabricator rebar and metal buildings are experiencing significant year-over-year gains in bookings backlogs and backlog margins.","Over the past several months our transits [ph] has increased at the overall U.S. non-residential construction market is set to deliver square footage growth in the range of at least 7% to 8% in 2015. Such a growth rate would still place at the market almost 40% below the peak level of 2007. Whatever short-term economic and steel industry conditions we face for the remainder of 2015 new horizontal rival position of strength will allow our team to continue to execute on our improvement strategies for delivering profitable long-term growth in shareholder returns. We appreciate your interest our company.","John?","John Ferriola","Thanks Jim. Nucor\u2019s culture has always been defined by our willingness to tackle and overcome challenges. We don\u2019t ignore problems that's not an effective strategy for success or even survival. We have confronted by challenges. We find ways to grow stronger while fixing or mitigating the problem.","During the first quarter, unprecedented volumes of steel and joist [ph] continued to be a major challenge for our industry, Blatant foreign government support of their steel industries has resulted in glut of global steel production. A brazen disregard of international trade rules has led to the dumping of steel products in our market. As a result, one in three tons of steel sold in the U.S. today is produced abroad, by less efficient, less safe and less environmentally friendly countries.","This is a real crisis for our industry. We are attacking this issue head on to fighting back. Nucor is working on a bipartisan basis with members of Congress and with the administration to ensure that we have strong and effective tools to combat on fair trade. If Congress passes trade promotion authority legislation by authorizing the President to enter into free trade agreements. We believe the bill must be balanced with the strongest possible trade enforcement mechanisms so that steel and other industries have the tools we need to fight this blatant disregard in international trade rules.","There is substantial support from both Democrat and Republicans for doing this. Additionally, the administration must pay a much tougher one with countries that break the law. We have a set of rules governing trades. We follow those rules on foreign countries and producers break those rules there must be meaningful consequences. Applying tariffs and other remedies is simply holding governments accountable for the agreements that they signed. To that end Nucor continues to assess market conditions and will be proactive and aversive in pursuing trade cases when and where it is appropriate.","I will now update you on some of our team's organic growth initiatives underway to improve our long-term cost position and expand our product portfolios to include more value added higher margins offerings that are less impacted by the tsunami of imports. After restarting operations at the end of the first quarter, Nucor Steel Louisiana is once again producing DRI, world class quality levels that our team established prior to the equipment failing [ph]. It is important to note that the process gas heater is not part of DRI technology utilized by Louisiana. But is ancillary industrial equipment required by operating plants. During Louisiana just completed shutdown, modifications to the process gas heating\u2019s original design were implemented to prevent the re-occurrence of a similar failure. One significant modification was the installation of two large damps [ph] to enable the process gas heater to control its cooling rate which will expand the life of the tubes that have failed in the past.","Another significant modification was the addition of a nitrogen [indiscernible] to the outlet of the heater to significantly reduce any collateral damage in the event of any future failure. Louisiana has been a challenging start, nevertheless it is a major step forward in the implementation of our long-term strategy to optimize our iron unit process. In fact, we believe it has already provided short-term benefits. Presence of our Louisiana DRI facility, having produced 1.3 million tons last year and preparing to resume production at the end of the last quarter was a meaningful factor supporting February's dramatic price [ph] adjustment of more than $100 per ton in scrap price. That very much supports our belief in the long-term benefit of our DRI investment.","In the first quarter of 2015 our Hertford county North Carolina plate mills recently added heat treating and normalizing assets continue to run at full capacity of approximately 245,000 tons annually. The Hertford county team is capturing a growing share of value added and higher margin plate products.","Relative to an investment of approximately $150 million, our value added capabilities both incremental pretax profit that should average $200 per ton through this cycle.","During the first quarter the first field installation of Nucor model's new Berkeley piling sections was successfully completed. This new product is the result of a $115 million project we started off in the fourth quarter of last year. Our customers will benefit from this new domestic talent [ph] solution as they pursue by American government funded infrastructure projects.","Nucor model's expanded product portfolio will also create valuable synergies with the other products and services bolstered by the skyline field, piling distribution business we acquired in 2012.","Our goal over the next several years is to grow our wider piling sections annual volume to 100,000 tons with combined steel mill and distribution pretax profit potential of approximately $450 per ton.","Momentum continues to build at Nucor's fieldBerkeley$98 million wide like capital project that started off in early 2004 and has shipped approximately 120,000 tons last year. We expect to ship about 200,000 tons of the new products in 2015 and eventually grow volumes to be at least 300,000 annually with the pretax profit averaging $100 per ton through this cycle. Berkeley now has the widest hot rolled gage capability of any sheet mill in the Southern United States market and with the finished wood capability of up to 72 inches.","A particular importance, the upgrade allows Nucor to produce thinner high strength steel grades that we planned to use to develop lightweight automotive applications.","As I said earlier, these are just some of the growth initiatives. I look forward to updating you again next quarter on our progress implementing our strategy for profitable growth.","Here are the some of the reasons why I believe Nucor will continue to deliver profitable long-term growth and industry leading returns on capital. Our low and highly variable cost structure is Nucor's bedrock competitive advantage. We understand that to generate attractive returns in a commodity business you have to be a low cost producer and see continual improvement in the cost structure. Our balance sheet strength and through the cycle cash flow generation underpins our long-term focus and ability to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities particularly during cyclical downturns.","Our upstream vertical integration into raw materials enhances the profitability and flexibility of Nucor's core steel making business. David J. Joseph Company's unmatched global raw material supply chain combined with our investments in DRI and scrap dealers is Nucor's best in class capabilities and flexibility in optimizing or is by far our largest single cost item iron units.","Our industry leading product and market diversity continues to grow as we move up the value chain in all of our businesses. Our downstream vertical integration into value added steel products enhances the profitability and flexibility of Nucor's core steel making business. Our expanded challenged market such as Harris Steel, Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel increased our ability to compete with unfairly traded influence by expanding our opportunities to add value to our customers.","Our commitment to achieving commercial excellence by leveraging Nucor's competitive advantages such as product diversity and operational flexibility to create more value tool and build stronger relationships with each of our customers. And most importantly Nucor's employees the right people. They embrace the Nucor cultures pay per performance philosophy and cash the continuous improvement and taking care of our customers plus shareholders and their fellow teammates. That is why they are company's greatest assets and our greatest competitive advantage.","As has been throughout Nucor's history, our company\u2019s [indiscernible] area head of us. Thank you for your interest in Nucor.","We would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Luke Folta with Jefferies.","Luke Folta","Good afternoon","John Ferriola","Good afternoon how are you.","Luke Folta","Good. Hey John can you help me bridge the gap between the commentary around non-res construction improvement and the shipment levels in the first quarter, if I look at some of the key categories and structural and even in the joist and decking and the bar businesses. There is some fairly healthy decline year-over-year. Could you just give us some color on what that driven by is that mostly an import issue or is it timing?","John Ferriola","Well it's actually a combination of imports and timing. You're comparing it to first quarter of 2014 and if we focus on one that's fixed structural. But most --","James Frias","I think it was comparing the fourth quarter of --.","John Ferriola","When you comparing the first quarter or fourth quarter of last year.","Luke Folta","I'm looking now year-on-year 1Q to 1Q.","John Ferriola","My bad. So if we focus on one particular area let's just take structural with these are the basically the same for all of the categories. But at the beginning of 2014 we're looking at a situation where as you said imports were much lower service center inventories were down we were going into a year where non-residential construction was projected to be up frankly in the first quarter we were talking about price increases that were out there. So, you know combination of all of those resulted in much higher order ranking rates in the first quarter of last year compared to the first quarter of this year.","Luke Folta","Okay. And then if you look at the full year expectation - square footage expected to grow about 7% to 8% this year I mean outside of the first quarter issue as it pertains destocking in imports would you expect that you\u2019re these categories should grow about in line with that pace?","John Ferriola","Again taking imports out of the equation if we see the growth that we are projecting in non-residential construction we should see volume increases as compared to the first quarter particularly as we move out of the seasonal issues that are affecting the first quarter in a lot of our business particularly when you look at some of the downstream businesses such as Harris where frankly the type of new construction work in the first quarter of January and February and many of our Harris facilities are located in Canada just to kind of amplify the situation so. We do expect it to improve as we come out of the first quarter weather conditions improve and we see the expected increase in non-residential construction.","Luke Folta","Okay. And just secondly on DRI understanding that we've got high cost inventory to work through and that impacts unit cost in the outage as well if we imagine a scenario where we stay in the sort of 260-275 pig iron environment and iron ore 50 bucks. Can you give us some sense how we should think about profitability of DRI at full production? Is it profitable meaningfully at that level?","John Ferriola","It would be cash positive at those levels when you're talking about pig iron at 250 we do transfer our DRI on a pricing mechanism that's based upon pig iron and I would say that at the level of about 250 for pig iron we are cash positive. I would also point out that I'd be quick to point out that I personally believe 250 for pig iron is an unsustainable level it's a result of some significant and unusual currency issues and the geopolitical issues so I personally would not expect that to stay at that low level long-term.","Having said all of that we have said from the beginning when we talk about the DRI project that over the close of the cycles is going to be times when we get singles times when we bonds and sometimes when we get grand slams. We talked just last quarter about the very positive contribution from our Trinidad operation and when pig iron was at a more normalized rate and we expected to be back up to those levels again and we expect to see a very good returns on our DRI investment when that occurs.","Luke Folta","Alright, thank you gentlemen.","Operator","We will take our next question from Timna Tanners with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners","Yeah, hey, good afternoon.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon. Timna, how are you?","Timna Tanners","I am okay, thanks. I wanted to make sure I can understand that what happened between your initial qualitative guidance to the quantitative guidance to the beat. Can you just talk us through what changed in your assumptions or what changed in the market environment to change the outcome?","John Ferriola","Certainly, we can do that. As always on these things as many factors but the key one the driver for all this was frankly the steel performance, the performance of our steel mill improved. In forecasting we underestimated the impact that we would have on our margins on scrap pricing going down we got to realize the lowest scrap price quicker and frankly in some of our products we had higher volumes. So the combination of an improved margin relative to our forecast and some volume increases above our forecast we did beat the forecast as you mentioned.","Timna Tanners","Okay, so two questions just to finish up then. One, why did prices fell less in sheet then they did in the plate and beams that's a very high profile to see how much sheet prices have fallen recently but plate and beams I thought it'd be fall on just more recently with the $100 scrap moving just in February so why did you see plate and beams fall more than you did in sheet in the quarter?","John Ferriola","For one element that you have to take into account when you to answer that question is that some portion of our sheet businesses on quarter-over-quarter contract pricing that's based on some mechanism. So when you - there is a lag time before you see that decrease in those contract pricing. I would also point out that although the import situation is very serious on sheet product and particularly plate has been unbelievable tsunami of imported plate over the last two quarters. And that of course had a dramatic impact on pricing of the plates.","Timna Tanners","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then the only thing that I want to ask is just, maybe it's philosophical but now I'm just been surprised that how I know prices always over correct in a down market. But why would a company like and many like yourselves, you have some flexibility to ramp down continue to produce at these very low prices and to match imports. Isn't there a price at which you say no I don't want to make that lower margin and I'm going to hold out and if the prices are expected to recover. Why is everybody including yourselves I guess continue to produce and offer these low price tons at import levels. Is that import equivalent level, what do you think?","John Ferriola","Well so it's balanced. Right, you want to look at you're the buying - your facility which obviously impacts your fixed cost of that facility. So that's one issue. Secondly we need to take care of our customers we don't want to give up market share sometimes when you lose a customer or lose a business opportunity it's hard to regain it. And our customers count on us being there even when it's difficult pricing environment.","So there are just a couple of reasons that we continue to operate. I'll also point out that Timna and let me know if I didn't answer that question if I did tell me what you wanted to hear on that. But given the radical change in the scrap cost which we frankly believe becoming because of the large gap between scrap pricing and iron units. We felt that we can work our way through those tough times keep our customer satisfied maintain our market share not lose good opportunities knowing that we would ultimately be able to as a result of our scrap cost going down to be able to correct our pricing and get it closer to the market to the imported price and maintain a margin.","Timna Tanners","That makes sense. Thanks for the answer.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Kurtz","Hey good afternoon guys.","John Ferriola","Hey Evan how are you.","Evan Kurtz","Good. My first question is on trade. So it seems like you're taking kind of a two pronged or maybe the industry is taking a two pronged approach to trade issues. One is just putting together a trade case and keeping at about on flat rolled. But the other is on the legislative front. Senator Brown has got these level playing field rules that is I assume trying to attach the TPA at this point. So it seems like maybe there is a chance you get some of these rules that would actually change the way that harm is measured in the US through in the next few months here. How do those two things impact one and other. So my question is would you wait to file a trade case on flat rolled if you think it could maybe change the rules at the ITC on the harm decision or are those completely independent?","James Frias","When we fight we use both of this, okay. So those are two pronged approach and we're going to use both of those prongs to achieve a level playing field. So that our team mates can be successful which we know they will be on a level playing field.","I've mentioned on the last couple of calls that I've told that we're gaining traction in Washington on both of those fronts I still do we are getting a much better reception. People are beginning to understand I believe people are beginning to understand the impact of these illegally traded products on our industry and on our team mates steel workers in general.","It's about focusing and pursuing trade cases when that's appropriate and moving forward on the legislative front at the same time. We see great opportunity frankly on the legislative front particularly with the TPA discussions that are going on today and we are pushing very, very hard to getting good reception on both sides of the aisle to the concept that if TPA is going to be approved it must be approved with strong trade language to protect our industries and give us the ability to better and more effectively and more proactively by illegally traded products.","Evan Kurtz","Great. And then just maybe on the trade case. What's kind of your outlook there on timing it seems like it's been a pretty weak first quarter from most folks at this point and second quarter probably for most folks will also be fairly difficult. Do you think the case is ready to bring at this point or do you need to demonstrate more harm before the industry is comfortable to filing.","James Frias","Well let me be clear we will continue to assess the market and we will implement the trade case at the appropriate time.","Evan Kurtz","Okay. And then maybe just one last one quickly on scrap. What's your view for the upcoming months it seems like flow is maybe somewhat pick up a little bit which would be negative or maybe demands coming back where you think it all shakes out.","James Frias","Well frankly our forecast will be pretty flat line for the rest of the year. Obviously when you talk about scrap is always slight variations in different regions. We expect some movements in different regions up 5 down 10 so forth as we go throughout the year. But overall as you look at the year as a whole I think we're going to be pretty flat lined on scrap prices.","Evan Kurtz","Great thanks. With that I'll turn it over.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matthew Korn with Barclays.","Matthew Korn","Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.","James Frias","Good afternoon. How are you?","Matthew Korn","I'm alright all right. Let me ask how much of your lead time is improve today say versus the bottom of this previous quarter. And how deeply are you sold into May June particularly as you're expecting much better results in the downstream segment looking at.","James Frias","Well as we mentioned in the script, this is a quarter of transition. So we're not quite sure when we'll see that actual kick in today. I would say a very modest improvement in lead times very modest frankly not significantly over the first quarter. And I would expand it would go across say I would apply it all basically all of our products. Now the one exception I would add to that is in the sheet side on the galvanizing the cold rolled products that those lead times are longer and we still see a pretty strong demand in that area.","Matthew Korn","Alright and kind of following up on that and on your volume expectations gradual construction in order to meet improvements. When you're looking into this transitional second quarter. Is the improvement in earning really going to be mostly a margin expansion story on the realization of scrap cost or could you see some real volume improvement.","James Frias","I would say it's the combination of the two. And again to give me it out further than that the most specific from that very difficult to do. But I would say that it was a combination of both.","Matthew Korn","Got it. Appreciate the time gentlemen. Thank you.","James Frias","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question format Murphy with UBS.","James Frias","Hi Hello Matt.","Matthew Murphy","Hi. Can you hear me?","James Frias","I can hear you great.","Matthew Murphy","I'm good thanks yeah. I was just wondering what your capacity utilization is right now if there was 65% on average for Q1 would it be lower than that now.","James Frias","It's about the same. I can't speak to what it is exactly today, but so far we are about the same.","Matthew Murphy","Yeah okay. And is that I mean I guess I'm just wondering what the does the recovery profile of that just like we should basically be watching imports coming off to drive that backup.","James Frias","Well again there will be a number of factors. Imports beginning to drop off. Although we have seen and I want to stress that it's going to be a while before we see that drop off. Although we've seen a slightly decline in licenses it was so much out there in the pipeline that this is going to take and so much is already reached the service centers and just filled up their inventory. It's going to be a wild before we work our way through that. And now I can tell you that for the first time this month and numbers that just came out on service and the inventories we see them coming down just a little bit but imports are some it's just certainly watch and there is other factors too particularly on our shade sheet business when you want to book at oil prices.","Now I can't tell you when it's going to recover but certainly we've seen a tremendous impact on our flat rolled business as a result of oil pricing going from $150 to $50 our volumes are way down. Same situation there we flooded the pipeline with material there has been a complete stop as they work their way through this inventory at some point maybe third and fourth quarter we'll start working our way through that inventory and we will see order rates that are consistent with new normal drilling levels that are expected with the lower price and other thing you can keep your eye on is currency obviously the strong dollar has an impact on what's happening both on our raw material side and on our steel shipment side and it relates to imports and other factors so I try to give you couple of things that you can keep an eye on but there is a multitude of things that we have to watch and see what\u2019s going to happen as we go forward.","Matthew Murphy","That\u2019s good color I mean and then basically just sort of looking at like these are six month thing but I understand but I understand its dependant on all of those factors I guess on scrap prices I have been little bit surprise that no one is expecting it seems much more weakness there given we have seen continued iron ore weakness and so I guess just on scrap what\u2019s the confidence of that we've got some pricing stability for a while here?","John Ferriola","Well, I mean all I can tell you is my confidence level we gave you our projection we believe in that projections we think that it's going to be fairly stable right now iron ore pricing its fluctuates a little but spend relatively stable also if there is a dramatic change in iron ore pricing it might have the inflection in scrap pricing but we don\u2019t see that at this time.","Matthew Murphy","Okay thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan","Michael Gambardella","Yes, good afternoon.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon, Michael. How are you?","Michael Gambardella","Very good. I have a question if you are assuming that scrap prices are going to stay relatively flat rest of the year and you saw a massive $100 drop couple of months ago. When do you or are you now picking up share against the integrated mills who are basically fixed cost and when you get $100 drop and scrap they saw a very little of it?","James Frias","Obviously it made us much more competitive and the reason people buy steel it\u2019s based upon four things I said this many times service, quality, on-time delivery and price. And when we are in a situation where there is such a difference between scrap and iron ore pricing we had a real disadvantage on pricing and that impacted our competitive position frankly when I think about how we did during that period with a gap with so large I am really proud of the job our team did on the other three elements of quality service and delivery that kept us in the game when we had $100 differential on cost and now that has been reduced the scrap coming down very confident that we will continue to be aggressive and now we've got we're competitive on all four of those elements and I feel good about the way that will go forward in terms of any market share.","Michael Gambardella","Is it your sense that you are gaining market share now?","James Frias","I am not going to get into specific at any one point in time. I'll just say again, we have the pricing competitive risk not only integrated but we reduced the gap between imported pricing and all pricing and we deliver superior quality service and delivery based on all of that I am confident that our team will gain market share as we move forward throughout the year now there is going to be a lot of practice that come into that as we've talked about in the past.","Michael Gambardella","Thanks a lot John.","James Frias","Okay.","Operator","We will take our next question from Brian Yu with Citi.","Brian Yu","Thanks good afternoon John and Jim.","James Frias","Brian how are you?","Brian Yu","Good, Just wanted to follow up Timna's comments earlier so I guess I'm equally surprised that spot price been computed down and I guess more 50 I know imports they continue to be a big problem but if you just look at where import offers are today versus physical flow that like do you think we pass the point where now it\u2019s more about domestic competition for market share versus all the domestic producers trying to keep out the imports?","James Frias","Let me be really clear about these imports continue to be our number one - we are focusing on pricing here but you need to remember that there is such a tremendous over capacity we are looking at 300 million tons of excess capacity worldwide. Now that has been a continuously good pressure on our market and our profitability. Having said that, we have reduced the gap between the domestic pricing and imported pricing but look imports are going continue to be our number one challenge for our industry and our company as a whole.","Brian Yu","Okay. Second question is this is more with your iron ore pellets inventory. How much inventory do you typically keep on hand at Louisiana I think you mentioned earlier that you're probably going to use through the high cost in second quarter so, if that occurs\u2026","James Frias","Let me if I may just correct that because I want to make sure we are clear on that. Today there is a gap of about $60 between the pricing of the iron ore that we have on ground and what market pricing would be. At the end of the second quarter we expect that we will reduce that gap from about $60 down to about $15. We will reduce the gap by $45 at the end of the second quarter it will be it will take us through the third quarter sometime around the middle towards the end of the third quarter before we reduce that last $15 gap and get us down to market price for iron ore. Please continue with your question but I want to correct that and be very specific on that.","Brian Yu","That was a lot more information I had hope for so great. But maybe along those lines how much inventory do you typically keep on hand so your fleecing price had moved down in Q1 and how long before that actually flows through in the more normalized basis and then I know you guys\u2026","John Ferriola","About iron ore you are asking about\u2026","Brian Yu","Yes, iron ore in general not in\u2026","John Ferriola","That would be about five to six weeks at Louisiana.","Brian Yu","Okay. And when you take these inventory adjustments the further LIFO credit incorporate assumptions about iron ore piling cost and that is accurately separate?","John Ferriola","Well it certainly effects our LIFO calculation at the steel mills at our LIFO but the DRI plants are not under LIFO.","Brian Yu","Okay, Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Nathan Littlewood with Credit Suisse.","Nathan Littlewood","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for the opportunity. Just had a couple of question the first one the market share on the back of Mark\u2019s question earlier. Could you talk a little bit about where you might be seeing market share opportunities and then say the back half of the year be it either by sort of product or end market?","James Frias","Well we've talked about the growth, the organic growth that we've had and the products that we're bringing to the market so certainly we would expect to see market share growth in our structural business with our new piling sections we talked about the growth in the sheet side of the business with - project and how we expect that to grow year-over-year.","SBQ would be another area as we continue to bring new products onto the marketplace. We are continually moving forward with our private in SBQ so, I expect market share growth in that area also and so, what are we outplay we mentioned we are running our heat treatment in normalizing the mining basically at full capacity and you know I mentioned the projects that we're doing on our SBQ mills so I don\u2019t want to leave our raw products which we are introducing raw products to the market that have been accepted very well so we expect to grow our market share there also.","And as I have mentioned on calls in the past one of the few bright spots pass in the marketplace today is automotive and we expect to grow up participation in automotive this year also last year we shipped about maybe 1.1 million tons sheet and SBQ combined products into automotive and this year we are anticipating shipping about 1.45 million tons of combined sheet and has continue into the automotive market and part of that's being supported by I'm going to put a little plug in here for our new Detroit automotive office that we've just established and it's been well received by the automotive companies we have - metallurgical and engineering team mates and sales people in that office to help support push into automotive.","Nathan Littlewood","That's useful John. Are there any updates on the sort of exposed order or body and white industry since last we spoke about this?","John Ferriola","No, Certainly body and white that's one of our strong points that we are moving into and when you say expose. Exposed accounts were about 15% of the weight of steel per vehicle. And certainly we want to play in that game and we do. We have a product that we can put into that and have put into that and exposed applications. But as clearly not a focus point for us. When we look at body and white we see 75% of the volume going in there that's our focus point. We look at what they called closures which represents 25% the remaining 25% and only 15% of that is exposed. So combined you're looking at 15% out of the total weight of the cost. It's not something it's not where our major push is going to be.","Nathan Littlewood","Got it, okay, that's helpful. And my final one was just one the DRI project and raw materials. So look I certainly understand the raw material strategy here and we do like the fact that there is this additional flexibility built into your sort of iron unit\u2019s procurement here. But I mean can we consider a scenario where the pricing environment is just not conducive to DRI bank profitable. And let's assume it something to do with iron ore and pig iron spreads. Could you talk a little bit about what sort of flexibility you have in your raw material contracts to effectively flex those volumes down. And so you're going to reduce DRI output just because it isn't profitable or it can't be profitable. And perhaps and bring it back again later in the future when margins or spreads are a bit more conducive to that plant being profitable.","James Frias","Well we get our raw material iron ore from four different sources. And I'm not going to give you the specifics of what kind of contracts we have with each one of those particular suppliers. But in general we have a level of about 25%to 35% flexibility in the supply of raw material iron unit. So we can credit back 25% to 35% and I'm talking now across all the contracts I'm not going to get any more specific on that.","But if I may I want to take a moment here, because there was a question earlier about the DRI and how should they look at when the cost of iron units and going down we would see improvements. And I answer the question because it was tied originally back to the amount of weeks on hand of iron ore supply inventory we had. And I said that we keep about five to six weeks of inventory on the ground. That is an accurate statement. But if he was looking to get some sense of when pricing changes relative to iron ore pricing on an index bases changes. We need to factor in the issue that we buy at a quarterly basis with a lagging quarter. So for whoever asked that question earlier about seeing changes in the pricing of raw material going into Louisiana please bear in mind when we see the change occur in the index there is a one quarter lag in the pricing that we see at the plant itself, okay?","Nathan Littlewood","Alright thanks very much John. Appreciate it.","John Ferriola","That correction is credit to Joe Stratman who held up a piece of paper and said quarterly pricing.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Phil Gibbs","Hi good afternoon.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon.","Phil Gibbs","Just had a question on the US rationalization of scrap collection and processing and maybe what you've been seeing there the last couple of months and whether or not you will be participating in that trend.","James Frias","Clearly as pricing has dropped and everyone it's in the processing again those it's been very challenging margins have been severely compressed. And it's very challenging for processors to make a decent profit. And we expect to see some people not making it through this very difficult time. Certainly we have a strong balance sheet which gives us the opportunity and we have a strong balance sheet and a history of taking advantage of downturns in trouble times to grow our businesses. So we'll keeping an eye out for assets that come available when they make sense they fit into our strategic plan for a raw materials as the locations are right the pricing is right I'll tell you what we won't be shy we'll be at the table.","Phil Gibbs","John I was just curious as to whether or not you're seeing actual rationalization particularly in the south.","John Ferriola","We haven\u2019t seen much of it yet. But remember that usually a lot of times it's not during the downturn where you see the greatest pressure on these companies, but actually during the upturn, but I have to stop replacing inventory when your completing inventory you generate cash, when you have to replace inventory you burn fluid cash, and sometimes that can be more challenging as it bottoms out, maybe the upturn when you really see company struggle to stay on business.","Phil Gibbs","Okay and then I just appreciate that and then I just had a question for clarification because you were generous enough to give out some of the targets here on Hertford and Berkeley on those projects. Were you saying that the Hertford normalizing line is about $200 a ton over what your normal mix is? And then the same thing with your Nu model on the 450 and then Berkeley on the 100? Thanks.","John Ferriola","That is correct.","Phil Gibbs","I appreciate it. Good luck.","John Ferriola","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Andrew Lane with Morningstar.","Andrew Lane","Hi, good afternoon. A couple of questions here, First I wanted to ask about the upcoming DRI facility outage in Trinidad in the second quarter is that a standard maintenance project or are you implementing process improvements that you just implemented at the Louisiana facility? And then on a related note, is the timing related to the availability of low price pig iron from abroad and what will be anticipated operating loss associated with the outage? Thanks.","John Ferriola","Let me work through this note, this is in fact a plan preventative maintenance for well shut down that is scheduled in advance and must be doing on a regular angle basis, without getting into all the technical indeed shut down and clean out the piping in the earnest. It's done about once a year, it takes about a month, and it\u2019s a normal process. We are frankly adding a piece of equipment in Trinidad that has nothing to do with Louisiana situation it\u2019s a polisher to improve the yields as the product ships from Trinidad to United States but that\u2019s a side issue there is no failure in Trinidad and anticipate variance it is strictly a planned maintenance outage. In terms of what we expected to get us with, James do you have that number?","James Frias","I am sorry I was thinking, I missed it.","John Ferriola","The question I was asked, can we have the estimate on what the cost of that project is?","James Frias","We don\u2019t have the estimated loss during outage but it\u2019d probably be less than what you saw from Louisiana for the quarter it's going to be much less than that, but there would be some loss from the loss structure of one month.","Andrew Lane","Okay. Thanks and then I change gears for a minute. Given your unique purchase to observe the scrap market to what degree have you seen scrap collection rates dry up in the slower price environment and how low would scrap prices have to fall before you would expect availability become a legitimate concern?","John Ferriola","Well although pricing is dropping, would those have negative impact on collection and flowing to the yards, bear in mind that it's also spring. It's a whole lot of at the time when people are collecting [indiscernible] in winter, transportation is not a factor like it is in winter. So they kind of balance out and although we have seen a small amount of increase in flowing to the yards it's not been significant and it's balanced by the two factors of lower pricing offset by spring time and there was another issue just to kind of build upon that\u2019s something that hasn\u2019t come up in all the discussion we have had today about scrap and I am a little surprised by it. But bear in mind that the other thing we look at to keep the supply scrap up in the United States is the load that we buy offshore particularly with the way the currency is today,[indiscernible]quite a bit of scrap on overseas.","Andrew Lane","And where is the majority of that scrap\u2026 incoming scrap coming from?","John Ferriola","As a general statement, Europe.","Andrew Lane","Okay great. Thanks for the color.","John Ferriola","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Lipshift with CLSA.","David Lipshift","Hey guys how you are doing.","John Ferriola","Good how are you?","David Lipshift","I am doing well. So a quick question you know you talked about pig iron being sort of low and expected eventually to bring back up. How do you think the removal of the export tax and figure out that China is going to impact out there.","John Ferriola","Well if it's a renewal of an excellent tax it should go up.","David Lipshift","I know they'll be able to explore more.","John Ferriola","Yeah so I mean the volume will go up their volume will their exports will go up. I'm not sure how much of that would actually make its way to the US as all the market I would expect that there will be other markets that will go to in Europe and in Asia and even in India will more logical markets from a logistics perspective and then here in the United States.","David Lipshift","So as just when whether that would put continue to put pressure on big iron prices.","John Ferriola","Absolutely, its economics, one of one supply and demand. And whenever you have a situation when more suppliers coming into the marketplace. It puts pressure on pricing. So but I would ask you to consider one factor and that is I can't test to the quality of the big iron coming out of China that might be a question.","David Lipshift","Okay. And you don't think lower big iron prices potentially put more pressure on scrap as well that people will start to take more big iron and then scrap could go lower.","John Ferriola","Same reason well supply buying units into the market and it bring pressure on all aspects of volume units, scrap, big iron, DRI.","David Lipshift","Okay thank you.","John Ferriola","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Tony [ph] with Cowen and Company.","Unidentified Analyst","Good afternoon gentlemen.","John Ferriola","Tony how are you?","Unidentified Analyst","Good John. John is there a rationale for the mills not raising prices yet. I mean service center indicate they would be receptive. We see the MSCI inventories are still a bit higher but the moving in the right directionally and it totally we're hearing that end users are living for the most part and the mills. And I'm just wondering how you feel about that.","John Ferriola","Well if there is a service center out there that I want some [indiscernible] from us guarantee at higher prices in the Norway, but as a general statement I understand your point. It\u2019s about an inflection whenever you at the bottom. And if you're asking me where I think we stand on that cycle I would say the couple of times during the - call that we this properly transitional quarter. So we might see something this quarter but I would ask you to remember that there is still a tremendous amount of inputs that are in the pipeline that are on their where [indiscernible] to the United States. So that continues to put pressure on pricing. As I said we'll listen we're not opposed to selling feel at a higher price we like to do that but we also have to take care about customers and maintain our market share in order to those factors that we spoke about earlier in the call.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, fair enough. And my second question is some of the industrial companies are starting to talk about some signs of softening with regard to US demand. Are you guys seeing any signs of declaration anywhere in your end markets, so outside of energy, and also if you could address\u2026","John Ferriola","I'd have to say no in fact I would say that our downstream products [indiscernible] is true. We see a significant improvement in our backlog order entry and backlog prices.","Unidentified Analyst","And would that be the same John from a standpoint of geographic as well.","John Ferriola","I'm not sure I understand what you mean by that.","Unidentified Analyst","Just in terms of different parts of the country. Obviously you guys have pretty good exposure.","John Ferriola","Yeah if there any part of the country than which we're seeing well that. But right now we will pretty well balance. I might say in Canada we're seeing again Harris - we're seeing much more improvement because they were down so significant because of weather conditions in the first quarter, but other than that pretty well balanced.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay thanks very much. Appreciate the color.","Operator","And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Ferriola for any additional or closing remarks.","John Ferriola","Well let me conclude by saying thank you, thank you to our shareholders and appreciate your confidence and your support. Thank you to our customers. We appreciate your business and I want to say thank you to my new teammates for creating value for our customers, generating attractive returns for our shareholders and building a sustainable future for all of us. And most importantly, thank you all for doing it safely. Thanks for your interest in Nucor. Have a great day and a great weekend.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference.

Please go ahead, sir","John J. Ferriola","Thank you, Keith. Good afternoon. This is John Ferriola, Nucor's Chief Executive Officer and President. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are other members of Nucor's senior leadership team: Dan Dimicco, Nucor's Executive Chairman; Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; and our other Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey, Keith Grass, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan and Joe Stratman.","First and most importantly, we want to thank everyone on our teams at Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit, Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel for working safely, working hard and working together to ensure Nucor's success. The more than 22,000 men and women of the Nucor team are our company's greatest asset and our greatest competitive advantage. You are the right people doing the right things every day to build our company's long-term earnings power. Thank you all.","Economic and steel market conditions remain challenging, but Nucor is in a position of strength in our industry, and we continue to grow stronger every day. Our team is primed and ready for the inevitable steel industry's cyclical upturn.","I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to review our third quarter results and financial position. Following Jim's remarks, I will provide an update on our many initiatives focused on profitable growth. Jim?","James D. Frias","Thanks, John, and good afternoon. Nucor's third quarter 2013 earnings of $0.46 per diluted share increased from the second quarter of 2013 earnings of $0.27 per diluted share. Results for the just-completed quarter included a onetime charge of $0.03 per share for estimated costs associated with the storage dome collapse at Nucor Steel Louisiana. Third quarter performance also exceeded our guidance range of between $0.35 to $0.40 per diluted share. Our guidance was issued on September 17 prior to the dome collapse on September 25.","The third quarter profit improvement was largely due to stronger performance in our sheet mills, as we were able to capitalize on opportunities resulting from competitor supply disruptions. Structural steel results also benefited from Nucor-Yamato's higher third quarter production rates following its planned 17-day outage in the second quarter. It is also worth noting that our downstream steel product segment, which includes joist and decking, rebar fabrications and pre-engineered metal buildings, has reported profits for 4 of the past 6 quarters. Nucor's fabricated products teams are delivering profitable performance in a very depressed nonresidential construction market.","A comment about our tax rates, which can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting all profits belonging to our business partners in the third quarter of 2013, the effective tax rate was 32.2%. During the quarter, we completed a capital raise that both lowered our cost of capital and lengthened our debt maturity profile. In late July, Nucor issued a total of $1 billion in debt, $500 million of 4% notes due in 2023 and $500 million of 5.2% notes due in 2043. This bond offering effectively refinanced $900 million of maturing debt that we retired in the fourth quarter of 2012 and in this year's second quarter. The weighted average coupon rate of the new debt is 35 basis points lower than the retired debt. We also lengthened our debt maturity profile. The new debt has a weighted average maturity term of 20 years versus less than 7 years for the retired debt. Our next significant debt maturity is not until 2017.","Financial strength remains an important attribute of Nucor's business model. It is critical to our ability to invest through the cycle and grow stronger during downturns. Nucor is the only steel producer in North America to enjoy the extremely important competitive advantage of an investment grade credit rating. At the end of the third quarter, our total debt-to-capital ratio was 36%. Cash, short-term investments and restricted cash totaled over $1.7 billion.","Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn. This facility was amended and restated following the debt offering with the maturity date extended almost 3 years to August of 2018. We have no commercial paper outstanding.","In the current very difficult steel market conditions, Nucor's cash flow generation remains very healthy. Through the first 9 months of 2013, cash provided by operating activities was $884 million. 2013 capital expenditures are expected to exceed $1.1 billion. By the end of the current year, Nucor will have invested approximately $8 billion of capital since the steel market's last cyclical peak. Nearly $3 billion of that total is being invested in the 2012 to 2013 period. These more recent investments, both capital spending and acquisitions, largely consist of what we view as relatively low-risk and high-return projects focused on strategic objectives to lower our raw material cost and expand our product mix to include more value-added offerings. Lowering our raw material cost improves our competitive position and profitability throughout the economic cycle. Expanding our portfolio to include more value-added, higher-margin products does the same, as well as reducing the competitive pressure we face from imports. We will complete a number of these strategic projects over the balance of this year and into the first quarter -- or first half of 2014.","For that reason, we expect somewhat lower capital expenditures next year. Spending at our steelmaking, raw materials and downstream products businesses should decline to closer to managed type levels. At the same time, our natural gas drilling expenditures will be at contractual levels, which we have previously disclosed totaling over $700 million for the 2 -- excuse me, $700 million for the 2-year period of 2014 and 2015.","Nucor's natural gas investments are securing a long-term, low-cost supply of natural gas sufficient to cover our expected future steelmaking and DRI production needs for more than 20 years. The performance of wells drilled over the past 2 years has exceeded the projections we used to justify this capital allocation. That, of course, translates into lower-than-expected gas costs. We also expect our natural gas investments to be cash flow positive by late in 2016.","For the fourth quarter, Nucor's earnings are expected to be moderately lower than the third quarter, as we typically experience lower shipments in this period due to seasonal factors. Additionally, we are planning extended production outages in this year's fourth quarter at several mills in preparation for previously announced capital expansion projects. These include our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill's wide, light product expansion, our Nucor-Yamato structural mill's sheet-piling product expansion and our Norfolk, Nebraska bar mill's SBQ product expansion.","Going forward, we see some encouraging signs in the marketplace. The Metals Service Center Institute September 2013 data released earlier this week reported both very lean inventories and improvement shipments at service centers. The Architectural Billing Index is in positive, indicating an expansion in billings in 12 of the past 13 months. In its most recent update, the American Institute of Architects stated that the trend points to an impending healthy upturn in nonresidential construction activity. We will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance in the final month of the quarter. John?","John J. Ferriola","Thanks, Jim. 2013 represents the fifth consecutive year of a stagnant global economy and, in turn, extremely difficult steel market conditions. Two facts tell the story. First, the U.S. steel industry's capacity utilization rate remains mired well below 80%. Second, imports of steel into the United States are on pace to again exceed 30 million tons this year or approximately double the 2009 level. These conditions make no economic sense at all given the fact that American producers are among the lowest-cost producers of steel in the world.","You have heard us say numerous times that the very serious problems depressing our economy and steel markets do have solutions. The American economy can be reinvigorated if our leaders simply allow us to seize the very significant opportunities open to our country today. These opportunities include an abundant and low-cost supply of energy, infrastructure rebuilding and a resurgent U.S. manufacturing sector. Importantly, they all offer the vital ingredient required for sustainable economic growth: jobs.","More specific to the steel industry, policymakers must address the huge issue of global steel overcapacity. In China and other countries, there are large amounts of steelmaking capacity that is not globally cost efficient, but continues to dump steel into the global marketplace as a result of government subsidies.","The Paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development this year estimated Chinese excess steel capacity alone is at least 300 million tons. As a result of the overcapacity, the current structure of the global steel industry is not sustainable. The discipline of the marketplace must be allowed to exert itself through free and rules-based trade. Why? That discipline rewards efficient producers with returns adequate to sustain their investments, providing value to the market in the form of product improvements and cost efficiencies. Equally important, the discipline of the marketplace punishes inefficient producers who destroys gas capital and other resources.","Until the issue of excess capacity is effectively addressed, Nucor will continue to apply our teams can-do attitude and high energy level to the fight for effective and timely enforcement of our nation's trade laws. If not for illegally dumped and subsidized steel imports, we would have more production and jobs throughout both the steel industry and the overall American economy today. Evidenced by our participation in last month's trade case filed against rebar imports from Turkey and Mexico, Nucor stands ready to pursue appropriate legal action when our industry is harmed by violations of U.S. and international trade laws.","Managing our business with a long-term perspective has been absolutely critical to the success of our company over the past 4-plus decades. Our long-term strategic focus has allowed us to adapt and expand our business model in response to market challenges and opportunities both operationally and commercially. With that longer-term view, we are bullish on the profitable growth opportunities for both the American economy and Nucor. As Jim mentioned, we will have invested approximately $8 billion of our shareholders' valuable capital from the last cyclical peak in the economy in 2008 through the end of 2013.","These investments have dramatically expanded Nucor's long-term earnings power. Our more recent investments during this downturn are low risk and high return. Rather than just adding capacity to an oversupplied market, Nucor is reducing its raw material costs and expanding our product mix to include more value-added, higher-margin offerings. Today, our unrelenting focus remains on executing our strategic plan and converting our $8 billion of investments into higher highs in profitability once the next cyclical upturn inevitably arrives.","I will now update you on the progress achieved by our team this quarter in executing our growth strategy. Construction is nearing completion on our 2.5 million metric ton annual capacity, direct reduced iron or DRI facility in Louisiana. However, startup of the plant has been delayed by about 3 months until the end of the year. As we reported in late September, a storage dome collapsed at the site. Most importantly, there were no injuries and no environmental impact.","The storage dome was 1 of 3 domes built to store iron ore. We are certainly disappointed by this event. However, I emphasize 2 very important points. First, this is not an issue whatsoever with the process technology we are using to produce DRI. Our team in Louisiana is continuing with hot commissioning of the plant. Second, we are addressing the problem and expect to start production by the end of the current quarter. Startup of our Louisiana DRI plant will be a huge step forward in the implementation of our raw material strategy. Combining Louisiana's 2.5 million tons capacity with the 2 million tons annual capacity of our existing Trinidad DRI plant will bring us to 2\/3 of our long-term goal of controlling 6 million to 7 million tons of annual capacity in high-quality scrap substitutes.","We expect our expanded DRI capacity pad with our long-term and low-cost natural gas supply, to be a game changer for Nucor's cost structure for the high-quality iron units we need to compete in higher-value-added sheet, SBQ and plate product markets.","In September, our South Carolina bar mill successfully started production on its new rod block. The rod block, along with earlier 2013 investments in a coil line and roughing mill stands, will allow Nucor Steel South Carolina to produce approximately 450,000 tons per year of rod and bar in coil products. Our team is very excited to have the opportunity to grow our participation in the attractive and underserved wire rod market in the Southeastern U.S. region. We have already received excellent customer feedback regarding the surface quality, dimensional tolerances and physical properties of our initial output.","I discussed on our July conference call the successful June startup of production on our Hertford County, North Carolina plate mills new normalizing line. Today, I am very pleased to report that the normalizing line is already running at full capacity. Our 120,000 ton per year capacity normalizing line serves attractive end-use markets, such as energy, transportation, shipbuilding and armor plate. Complementing our recent investments in a heat treat facility and a vacuum tank degasser, Hertford County's value-added plate products annual capacity has now doubled to 240,000 tons.","Steel Technologies' new facility in Monterrey is now fully operational. A new flat-rolled steel processing and pickling operation has an annual processing capacity in excess of 800,000 tons and offers light gauge slitting, heavy gauge slitting, blanking, cut to length and Eco Pickled Surface, EPS, pickling. Our team in Monterrey is very pleased to be running the North American market's largest capacity EPS pickling line, an effective and environmentally friendly technology, which offers significant advantages over traditional acid pickling.","Customer reaction to the quality of the product they have received has been extremely positive. This premier processing operation represents a $67 million strategic investment for Steel Technologies in the growing Mexican market.","Our next major project to start up will be the Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill's wide, light project, which is scheduled for the first quarter of 2014. This investment involves an upgrade and modernization of equipment from the top of the caster through the reversing mills. It will provide Berkeley the capability to produce wider and lighter gauged sheet steel.","Berkeley's new product offerings will include 72-inch wide hot rolled, 72-inch wide hot rolled, pickled and oiled, 72-inch wide cold rolled and gauges as thin as 0.042 inch. These expanded capabilities will provide profitable opportunities to move up the value chain in agricultural, pipe and tube, industrial equipment, heavy truck and automotive high-strength and ultra-high-strength applications. Customers are already inquiring about placing orders for these new products soon to enter production.","There is no question that steel market conditions remain frustratingly challenging. Nevertheless, these are exciting times for Nucor, as our company grows stronger and stronger. A stronger Nucor is one that is continually improving its capability to take care of all of our customers, the people who buy and use our products, our teammates and our shareholders.","In closing, I want to again thank everyone on the Nucor team for working safely, working hard and working together to build a stronger Nucor. Thank you, and please keep it going. We would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from the line of Michelle Applebaum.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","I have 3 but I only get 2, right?","John J. Ferriola","We'll start with 2 and maybe you can come back later in the call.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","Yes, yes, yes. So right now, I think something people are talking about -- a macro question. The sheet industry appears to be changing the approach on how you quote contracts, and there has been a lot of controversy over the CRU minus kind of discount with CRU sort of being the standard, I guess, index. Can you talk about, one, what impact it's going to have on the sheet business next year? Two, how are the contracts coming for next year? And three, what percentage you would like to have under contract for the coming year? That's still kind of one question. It is.","John J. Ferriola","It is. Okay, we'll handle it as one question. Well, I will speak for Nucor. I won't speak for the rest of the industry in terms of contract pricing. But as we talk about the CRU and the CRU minus, we at Nucor have recognized that the returns that have been generated by that pricing mechanism were not compensating us for the quality, the service, the on-time delivery that we provide to our customers every day. So we felt that it was necessary to change that, and we're in the process of changing it as we speak to our customers today. As far as how is it being received, well, certainly it's a little challenging, but our customers overall understand the need to have a pricing mechanism in place that allows for a sustainable, long-term company. So it's been a little bit challenging, but it's being received as we move along. Today, our contracts are going a little slower than normal, but we are making progress, and our customers seem to be accepting the concept of needing a change. In terms of what percent that we would be shooting for in 2014, as always, it kind of depends on where we end up with the pricing and what the contracts look like. Typically, we like a mix that's somewhere between 40% to 60% contract and with the rest remaining in spot. There's times when spot can really serve us well. For example in the last quarter, our ability to take advantage of some of these supply disruptions that occurred in the sheet market resulted in a very good quarter for us. And I want to thank our commercial team for being on top of that and taking advantage of that opportunity and doing very, very well in capitalizing upon it. So we would be looking for somewhere maybe around 50%, Michelle, but we'll go 10% or 15% either side of 50% depending upon what the contracts look like.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","You didn't say what you were replacing the CRU with? Are you just doing it on the price basis entirely?","John J. Ferriola","Well, you're absolutely correct. We did not say it, okay. And that is something that we discuss with our customers, and I'm not going to get into it here other than to say that we are moving away from a CRU minus pricing mechanism or, for that matter, any index-based minus pricing mechanism.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","Okay. Well, I wasn't a fan of that, so I'd say here, here, it's a good choice, and I hope the market supports it. My second question is, so recently, we saw the closure of the -- I think, it's 0.5 million ton a year EVRAZ Claymont, Delaware plate mill. Is that a facility that overlaps with your product mix? And what kind of impact do you think it'll have on you? And do you think it could potentially be a consolidation target for you? Again, one question.","John J. Ferriola","You're getting better and better at this, Michelle.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","Well, trained.","John J. Ferriola","Well, let me make a couple of comments about the closing at Claymont in terms of how it will impact our business. Clearly, they are a -- they tend to provide a thicker product to the market. We go from 1 to 2 inch. 2 inch is our maximum thickness that we can offer the market. That being said, -- excuse me, 3 inches, what we can offer the market. That being said, there are some overlaps on the grades that we produce, and we have seen an incremental pickup in inquiries and order entry as result of them closing. Obviously, there's -- we serve a similar geographical territory. I would also take the opportunity to give a plug to our plate mills. Hertford County, which serves a similar area, has the additional benefit of offering normalized and heat-treated product as we mentioned.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","I think you've mentioned that.","John J. Ferriola","Yes. I mean, I'm probably going to mention it a few more times before the call is over because we're really proud of that fact, and it has been very, very instrumental in supporting our other plate business. It gives us the ability to compete in markets with those other competitors who can offer similar products. So it's really expanded the grades that we can offer to the marketplace.","Operator","And we'll go next to the line of Luke Folta.","Luke Folta - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","My question I -- in just looking at this whole Gulf Coast chemicals expansion that we're seeing, we're starting to see some pretty major stuff move forward. If you look -- I mean, it's estimated over the next few years that we could see something like $50 billion plus of spending on ethylene plants and other chemical-type jobs, and you've got LNG export terminal layered in on top of that. I guess, when I look at those numbers, they'll seem like pretty massive numbers to me, and all that stuff's made -- it's very steel intensive. And I'm just -- I guess, my question is, is there any way you can help us connect the dots in terms of that level of spending? What could that mean for Nucor in terms of your addressable market? Are you selling the right products to the -- that would go into this stuff? Anything that could help connect those dots would be very helpful.","John J. Ferriola","Well, you've heard us mention several times over the last several years of our participation in the energy-based markets. That was a target we had several years ago. We recognized that there was going to be an improvement in the energy market, and we decided probably about 5 or 7 years ago to be a very active participant in that market. And towards that end, we've worked hard to develop new grades that serve the energy market well, and we've grown tremendously in that market. Today, along with automotive, energy, as you know, energy and automotive are 2 of the strong markets out there today, and we have a very strong participation in both. As far as energy goes, I would say that in addition to having gone over the last 5 to 7 years to improve our participation, we continue to develop new grades on our plate business to better serve that market and get a larger participation in that market. Joe, anything in particular you would like to add in terms of grades that we're working on?","R. Joseph Stratman","We have the degassing project, as well as the heat normalizing in the Q&T heat-free [ph] line, have been focused on high-strength steels for construction industry and very heavily focused on the energy sector where our steels now can go into the offshore oil platforms, as well as the heavy tank industry, for tank farms for holding oils and gases, as well as the construction of those plants. So that has been a targeted focus of some of the upgrades that we have made at the Hertford plant. And it's shown very good progress and good orders already. So we're looking forward to those of days, Luke, when all that comes online.","John J. Ferriola","Joe, I would just add to that, that we, Nucor, are the supplier of choice for tubulars because of our outstanding gauge control. Our gauge control was second to none, and that's important to the tubers. So we have a very strong participation in that market also. And when you think about our -- the location of our facilities, we're able to serve them very well with barge delivery and with rail.","Luke Folta - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess the sales into those kind of mega-type projects, do they tend to happen more through direct -- big direct contracts in that sense? Or is that something that you just kind of -- it flows down through distribution and some of the component manufacturers and things like that? How do we -- how should we expect that to flow through?","John J. Ferriola","Well, actually, both. It flows both ways. Obviously, a lot goes through our service centers. But we also have a team that focuses specifically on the energy market in terms of large projects, in terms of the construction of the projects, in terms of construction of the pipelines carrying the energy products. So it's really both ways, Luke. We have a team focused on direct sales, and we obviously sell a lot into that through our service centers.","Operator","And we'll go next to the line of Sohail Tharani.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, I think you mentioned that natural gas investments, $700 million. Is it 2014 and '15 combined? Or is it each year, $700 million?","John J. Ferriola","That was a combined number.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I just want to understand, this is -- this will be enough gas for running 2 DRI plus all the gas you use. What is your -- how are you thinking in terms of the second year at plant? And if it gets delayed, will you be able to reduce the investment or the amount of gas you extract or you will be able to sell it into the open market?","John J. Ferriola","Well, let me start by making a couple of comments. First of all, at the peak of our gas drilling operations, we would be able to deliver enough gas for 2 of our DRI facilities. All of our steel mills would still have surplus gas. Secondly, you mentioned about the start of construction on the second DRI facility. I mentioned during the last call that we will be addressing that. We want to get the first one up and running. And then we will take a look at what we want to do with the second facility. I can tell you there's been an awful lot of interest in the marketplace on purchasing DRI from us and having a facility that would run on a merchant basis. But one thing I do want to stress right away, the way that you asked the questions kind of implied that we might delay the decision of the second DRI plant based upon events that were taking place today in Louisiana with the dome. And that is absolutely, categorically not the case. It has nothing to do with it. This is a short-term issue with the dome. We're already well into a work-around to get around the issue. This has nothing to do with the technology. It's simply an issue with the raw material transportation. And I think I mentioned on the last conference call that this is extremely complex because of the size of it. The material handling is an extremely complex system, and we actually expected a few hiccups. Now this is a bigger road bump than we were hoping for, but in typical Nucor way, we're facing it head-on and we're resolving it. So there's no impact on long-term -- on long-term strategy relative to DRI as a result of the dome.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And I certainly didn't imply that -- regarding about the dome. I understand the dome is just a storage facility that has nothing to do with your process and project. The second question is that if I look at your joist and deck volume versus the fabricated product volume for fabricated concrete reinforced steel volume, they're sort of diverging from each other. The joist and deck is up 10% to 12% to 14% and the rebar fabricated products is down 11%. I just want to understand, are these catering to different markets or is there something else going on over here?","John J. Ferriola","Ray, why don't you field that one?","Raymond S. Napolitan","Yes, sure, John. Well, the rebar fabrication market and the joist and deck market do cater to somewhat different markets. And I would say that there are just some different dynamic markets involved. And as we mentioned the last quarter, the weather still continues to impact rebar fabrication shipments just a little bit as they did the first 2 quarters of the year.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Does it have to do -- anything to do with the private construction and public construction? Or that's not the case?","John J. Ferriola","He asked the question about is it tied to private versus public construction.","Raymond S. Napolitan","Well, the answer is yes, there is some tied to -- there is more tied to public construction on the rebar fabrication side. And joist and deck tends to be more towards private construction, yes, sir.","John J. Ferriola","One more comment that I'd like to make since you're asking about rebars. I kind of alluded to it in the prepared comments. But the imports of rebar over the last quarter have been a major issue for our company and for our country. And that has impacted our business on the rebar side also. I would point out and maybe just reinforce what Jim said during his comments, kudos to the entire product team. Despite the challenging nonresidential construction market that we've lived through, they have been profitable 5 out of the last 6 quarters. And when I talk about being excited about Nucor's future and I think about the fact that nonresidential construction is at its lowest point in 30 to 40 years and despite that, our teams have found a way to remain profitable 5 out of the last 6 quarters, I get very excited about what we will be doing when the nonresidential construction market inevitably returns.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Timna Tanners.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was happy to hear some more detail on the different projects. Some of the other steel mills have been talking quite detailed. They're giving a lot of detail, I guess, on their cost savings or their initiatives, benefits or payback times. So this is a step in that direction. But I guess can you talk a little bit more about how we might think about the contribution of some of these into next year? How do we quantify like the incremental benefit, whether it be cost or prices or volume?","James D. Frias","Well, Timna, typically, when we announce projects, we give a capital budget. And I think you have a feel for what type of hurdle rates we think about. We typically don't break out details of the returns of each project. But I think you can make a rational estimation based on the cost of the projects themselves.","John J. Ferriola","And Timna, I would ask you to think about the fact that in addition, as you mentioned, all projects involve both cost mitigation and the offering of new products to the marketplace. So it's really, in many cases, we have projects going on that will give us a double benefit. So as Jim said, we do have a certain hurdle rate, and in some of our projects that we're working today and that we mentioned earlier today, we will see the benefit from both sides of that equation.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Into 2014, it sound like then we'll start to see some of that?","John J. Ferriola","Yes. As we said, in Berkeley, a wide light project will start in the first quarter. The NYS projects will start sometime around mid of next year, offering the 3 new piling sections for the market. That's a really exciting project. So we see a lot of them coming to fruition in the early part of 2014.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, cool. My question, I guess, the next one that would be, the second one, is really to delve a little bit further into this idea of value-add and the investments you've made, whether it be vacuum degassers or the wide light project. And it's a question on the auto industry. And we've written something about maybe the tables turning even a little bit toward the steelmakers this next year. And I know Nucor has been moving toward supplying more auto, and I just wondered if you can give us an update to the extent possible on your progress there?","John J. Ferriola","Well, we continue to make progress there and offering the next generation of advanced high-strength steels. We're committed to working with our automotive customers to provide a great product. We recognize the challenge they're facing as a result of the CAFE requirements that will be coming into effect probably in 2018 and fully in 2025. So we've been working, and I've mentioned a few times, the high-strength and ultra high-strength product that we've been developing. They are in the marketplace today, and they're doing very, very well. I would also say that without giving any specifics as to the customers or the contracts that we're working under, we have ongoing automotive exposed steel trials as we speak, and we are quite optimistic about the outcome of those trials.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tony Rizzuto.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","With all of the exciting investments you've got on the come, can you guys quantify the start-up costs that we're likely going to see in the fourth quarter and into 2014? Can you talk about that a little bit? And I've got one more question, too.","James D. Frias","Yes, I'll take that. In the second quarter, our pre-operating start-up costs were around $6 million. In the third quarter, they were in the neighborhood of $11 million, and we're forecasting the fourth quarter to be just over $13 million. We would expect that they would probably level off in the first quarter and maybe even fall off a bit with the DRI plant coming fully on-stream and then decline from there.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. So first quarter . . .","James D. Frias","There's probably going to be some incremental pre-operating start-up costs with the wide light project and the beam project as well. But they will be short term. They won't be long-term periods. So last for maybe a quarter each as they go through the start-ups.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","All right, great. And then also, your performance turned out to be much better than you guys guided in the middle of September. And I was wondering, was there a major area of variance or was there an acceleration of demand? I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on that a little bit.","John J. Ferriola","Well, we did see some incremental demand improvement in the sheet market, but it was incremental. Really what we saw was more of an issue of disruption in the supply. And as I mentioned earlier, our commercial team just did an outstanding job of capitalizing on that opportunity and most of the improvement that you see is a result of our improvement on the sheet side of the business during the quarter.","James D. Frias","And Tony, I would just say that our divisions helped us come up with our forecast. And our sheet mills were probably a little conservative in their forecast for September, and they came in a little better than they thought they would. And that was the biggest driver.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","When you guys look -- you mentioned about the investment with wider width at Berkeley. Is that going to be going towards the automotive industry in terms of the ultralight gauges? Or was -- I heard other markets being mentioned. I don't know if I heard automotive there.","John J. Ferriola","No, it will be going to several markets. We kind of ran through them. It will be certainly automotive, agricultural, heavy truck, industrial applications, white goods would be just some other ones that I would mention.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","All right. I kind of slipped that third question there. I appreciate it.","John J. Ferriola","That's okay. The key thing to note on that is that the items that we kind of ran off there, all involve high-strength or ultra high-strength applications, which is critical, and that's one of the key things we're focusing on out of Berkeley and our other sheet mills.","James D. Frias","I mean, let me add just a couple more. [indiscernible] allows us to give more [indiscernible] out of a coil. So they have a lot of our customers. And secondly, we're able to go to a lot lighter hot band than we've ever been able to go to before. So there's a lot of applications in that lighter hot band that we'll be able to facilitate more so than we ever have.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Evan Kurtz.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a question on the potential for SBQ consolidation. I know you guys have been kind of pushing over the past few years here to move into higher and more premium applications for SBQ. I know there's a bunch of assets that are kind of being stripped out of a competitor of yours over the next year here that are already towards the very high end. There are 6 kind of major producers out there. Do you see any sort of potential? Is that something that you're interested in?","John J. Ferriola","Well, as always, we're not going to make any direct comments other than to say that we are always opportunistic. If we see the right opportunity at the right price, we'll move on it. And you're right, we have been focusing in our SBQ business on higher and higher valued opportunity -- applications. On Nebraska, we've been focusing on automotive with primary axle, camshafts, gearing, suspension and steering components. In Memphis, crankshafts, hubs, several other products. Bottom line is when you look at our SBQ products, we recognize that there is some consolidation occurring but there's also some new SBQ competition coming online. And that's why our team are focused on moving up and up on the value chain. Jim, is there anything that you'd want to add to that?","James R. Darsey","I'd just add that the investments that we've been making are geared primarily toward improving our quality of the project that we're doing in Nebraska as we speak, is installing a new hot sheer, cold sheer, packaging material and quality instrumentation that allows us to move up the value chain and produce higher-quality products. While we're doing these projects, we are also doing a number of trials with a number of Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive suppliers to get qualified to produce automotive-grade material. And as we go through these qualifications, we're setting ourselves up to participate more in the automotive industry going forward.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got you. And maybe just one on rebar. The trade case has kind of been out there for a month or so for now. I know there is a tiny price increase that was announced, mostly just to keep up with the scrap, it seems like. But are you noticing any sort of change in behavior from buyers on the rebar side? Or do you feel like we're getting close to some sort of inflection here?","John J. Ferriola","I don't think we've noticed a major change in the buying habits of the customers. Obviously, whenever we begin trade action, the countries that are importing the product get nervous. We see a slight reduction in the amount of imports coming in. But other than that, there's been no major change in the buying habits.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Lane.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I have 2 DRI-related questions. First, it seems as though your increased DRI production will allow you greater flexibility with regard to the basket of feedstocks you can apply to your furnaces. It will also allow you to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities associated with feedstock costs when DRI, pig iron and high-grade scrap prices change relative to each other. Once you're first Louisiana DRI facility is online, how different will your average feedstock basket look relative to its current composition?","John J. Ferriola","Well, it certainly will include more DRI. You answered the question very well yourself in asking the question. What it really does is give us a tremendous amount of flexibility. So every month, we'll go out and we'll take a look at the various commodities. We'll look at where we are with DRI. We'll look at the HBI pricing. We'll look at pig iron pricing. We'll look at prime scrap, obsolete scrap. And based upon that, we will adjust the basket, as you call it, the basket or the recipe, we would refer to it as, on almost a monthly basis and do what gives us the best cost advantage each month.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then secondly, given DRI's high iron content that can be used as a supplement to lower-grade scrap or a replacement for higher-grade scrap in the melt, how will your increased DRI production impact the quantity of scrap and the quality of scrap you purchase? And will it allow you to generate cost savings by making purchases further down the quality spectrum with regard to scrap as you apply more DRI?","John J. Ferriola","Obviously, as we use more DRI, we can reduce the amount of prime scrap that we use in the mix. But again, we'll take a look at that on a basket-by-basket case and make the right decisions predicated upon the pricing of the various commodities. But as a general statement, yes, we've invested a lot in our DRI facility. And we've invested in our steel mills and their ability to better feed DRI into the furnaces, do it more effectively, do it quicker. So we will be using a lot of DRI as we move forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Aldo Mazzaferro.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","I had a question on the capital spending budget maybe for Jim here. Over the last calls or 1 or 2 calls, you've sometimes said that you might push your CapEx down to -- closer to the sustaining and maintenance level, and I think you said the same today. Once on a call, you estimated that out of your $1.1 billion, only about 20% was actually sustaining capital. So I guess my question is, where does that sustaining capital number lie? Is it somewhere between your depreciation and maybe the $200 million? Or is it -- would it be likely to be under depreciation?","James D. Frias","So this question on the amount that we would view as sustainable is probably as well addressed to John as I. But I would say it's in the $300 million to $400 million per year range. John?","John J. Ferriola","I would agree with that. We don't use a hard and fast formula compared to depreciation. We take a look at where we are in the cycle of maintenance and make a decision that's best to keep our facilities in perfect operating condition and be able to provide a great quality product to our customers.","James D. Frias","So Aldo, if we think about 2014, and certainly to say a final number, that we'll have that baseload number of $300 million to $400 million. We'll have some carryover on the finishing thin and wide and some of the other big projects that are underway. And then we'll have the gas investment, a significant portion of that $700 million over 2 years that we'll be spending. So it will probably approach $1 billion, but be below $1 billion, would be my thinking right now. But again, we'll go to our Board of Directors in December with a final budget, and then we'll come back in January for that conference call, and we'll give you our budget target for 2014 at that time.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","Great. So that gas spending is kind of front-end loaded a little bit then, too?","James D. Frias","Yes, in a sense, that's how we almost think about it, is we're prepaying for gas by paying the drilling costs of getting access to it in the ground. And when we had an earlier question about all of the evolution of the chemical industry that's coming in the Gulf Coast area, that's another factor that we think about. And we also think there is a big trend of power plants using gas. It's hard to predict what future gas prices are going to be, but they do have the potential to go back up into a $6 or $7 range. And we'll have a very, very nice competitive advantage with our locked-in cost of gas for a number of decades.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","And just a very quick second question. Can you say how long and what the capital cost might be for the DRI in second investment and how long the construction phase would be and what you might spend on that?","John J. Ferriola","Well, as we've mentioned several times, we've invested the infrastructure that we have as part of the project. The first DRI will also cover the second DRI facility. So the investment would be somewhat less. So we would probably put it in the neighborhood of about $550 million to $600 million, just as an estimate. We haven't really begun work on that at this time. And the construction time would be a little bit less, not significantly less. Obviously, the furnace is the big item being installed, and that would, of course, be about the same length of time. So it might a little bit shorter, and it will be a little bit less expensive.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mark Parr.","Mark L. Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I was just curious if you could give a little more color on the natural gas drilling activity. How many wells do you expect to complete this year? And also, you've talked about cost coming, being a positive surprise. Any color around that would be helpful. And then lastly, if you could just give us an update on the plan to monetize some of the midstream assets and would be curious in terms of timing on that.","John J. Ferriola","Well, let's start with the number of wells that we are currently drilling. Keith, you want to take that, please?","Keith B. Grass","Yes. We're in the range of 200 wells right now, and we'll probably finish up the year somewhere in the range of 240, 250, somewhere in that range in terms of actual number of wells. And I'm not sure -- I can't remember exactly what the next question was.","John J. Ferriola","Yes, the second question was the timing on the midstream that we've mentioned in the past, that it's possible that we would end up flipping the midstream assets. And I think that timeframe was...","Keith B. Grass","Yes, [indiscernible] time, and it's probably in the 2016, 2017 time period. I would say...","James D. Frias","I would answer this. We're on track with the original plan and the layout for that midstream, those assets to build out, and that was the general time frame I think we indicated early on, and we have really no significant barriers from that right now.","Mark L. Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess just the other thought was just to try to get some more color around the cost that you're -- the cost of completion or the underlying cost of the actual operating wells in terms of Mcf or however you'd like to give additional color on that.","Keith B. Grass","We still view that as confidential. And as I mentioned, I've mentioned a number of times in some of the venues I've been in, there will be a point in time where we have enough volume that we have to make full SEC disclosures like an E&P company, and then you'll see all that detail. But until that time, we'd like to keep that to ourselves. We think it's valuable information.","John J. Ferriola","What we mentioned during the script was that the wells, the gas that we are getting out of the wells, the rate that we were being able to drill and get gas out of the wells is greater than what put into the initial performance.","Keith B. Grass","And I've said that it's worth noting that year to date, it's having a small positive impact on our income statement. So our costs have been below the market price on average so far this year.","Operator","And we'll go next to the line of Matthew Murphy.","Matt Murphy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a question on DRI. Does the delay with the storage dome -- you talked about you're still hot commissioning the process. Does that add some confidence on how quick you can ramp it up since you've got a bit more time with the process side?","John J. Ferriola","It does. We will have more time to do a more thorough process, hot commissioning. So yes, I would say that it will reduce the overall startup time. The DRI process, as a general statement, however, is kind of an on-off thing. It starts up and it runs or it doesn't start up. So we're highly confident that when we're ready to start at the end of the year, we overcome this issue with material handling, we will have a relatively quick startup.","Matt Murphy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I guess just on the purchasing for inputs next year, do you have to commit to any pig supply to make sure you've got it if there are any hiccups? Or how short order can you get material if you need it?","John J. Ferriola","We have everything laid out. We have 4 good suppliers, all of which are proven suppliers. We see no problems at all with the supply of raw materials.","James D. Frias","And we don't feel like we're going to have to take material and store it some place because of this issue. We think we're fine in that regard.","Operator","And we'll take a quick follow-up from Michelle Applebaum.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","Can you remind me, what live permits do you have going at your Louisiana site, what kind of facilities are you currently permitted to build and when do these permits run out?","John J. Ferriola","Let's see. We -- you want to take that one?","Raymond S. Napolitan","Yes. Right now, we're permitted to build 2 DRI plants. We're not worried. We started on them. On the second DRI plant, I can't remember the exact -- but it's a matter of many months from now -- [indiscernible] to say whether we're going to start that permit will still be valid.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","So you're not permitted to build a steel mill anymore or are you?","John J. Ferriola","We have a permit that's still in place for a blast furnace operation with a coke ovens at that facility. We've never had a permit for a steel mill.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","Sorry, I misspoke. Okay, and how long does it","[Audio Gap]","John J. Ferriola","I think she dropped accidentally, but I'm guessing she's going to ask, how long does the blast furnace permit stay live?","Raymond S. Napolitan","We're not going to get into specifics, Michelle, if that's what you're asking. I'm not sure if you're still on the line. But we won't get into specifics of the length of time of the blast furnace permit.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Sohail Tharani.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jim, at this time, you are reporting an earning in the equity in the consolidated affiliates. Is that from the Italian operation?","James D. Frias","It's a net [ph] of a couple of operations that are in there. But a big part of it is NuMit and the performance in our joint venture with Mitsui. This chip [ph] technology business has shown continual improvement, and it's gotten to be big enough that it's offset the losses we were experiencing in our Italian operations.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions in queue at this time. I'll now turn the program back over to our presenters for any closing remarks.","John J. Ferriola","Thank you, Keith. Let me close by again by saying thank you. Thank you all on the call for your interest in Nucor. Thank you for our shareholders for your continued support. Thank you to our customers for your business.

Please go ahead, sir.","Leon Topalian","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. In my first call, as CEO of Nucor, I'm honored to have the opportunity to lead this company and to serve alongside the 27,000 men and women of Nucor, who inspire me every day. Joining me on the call today are the members of Nucor's executive team, including Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Craig Feldman, responsible for raw materials and logistics; Ladd Hall, responsible for flat-rolled products; Ray Napolitan, responsible for engineered bar products, as well as Nucor's digital initiatives; MaryEmily Slate, responsible for plate, structural and tubular products; Dave Sumoski, responsible for merchant bar and rebar products; and Chad Utermark, responsible for fabricated construction products.","I also want to thank John Ferriola for his leadership during the past seven years as CEO and the impact he has made over his 28 years with our company. We thank him for his many contributions to Nucor and wish him all the best in his retirement.","At Nucor, our greatest competitive advantage is our culture and the greatest measure of that culture is how we care for one another through the value of safety. 2019 was the safest year in our history and I would like to thank all of my teammates for achieving this tremendous result. Nucor is a continuous improvement company. ","Our challenge and opportunity is to achieve breakthrough improvements in this core value. Over the last several months, I have engaged our team to ask how we can continue to improve our performance in safety, and we plan to work together with our teammates to implement their ideas and strategies. I look forward to making 2020 an even safer year for Nucor together.","In 2019, Nucor recorded earnings of $4.14 per diluted share. This was a good result, given the challenging steel market conditions that prevailed throughout much of the year. Strong performance in many of our steel products businesses helped to partially offset the destocking, that negatively impacted our steelmaking operations.","In particular, I would like to recognize both Vulcraft and Verco and our Buildings group, which each achieved their most profitable year ever, as well as our rebar fabrication operations, which posted much improved results over 2018, reflecting both strong execution and favorable non-res construction market conditions. Thank you for this result.","We believe that inventory destocking concluded in the fourth quarter when customers resume more normal buying patterns. General business conditions also improved as the fourth quarter progressed due to a number of factors, including a rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the new labor agreement between the United Automobile Workers and GM, as well as progress on U.S.-China trade relations and the passage of the U.S., Mexico, Canada trade agreement by Congress. ","With regard to the USMCA, we applaud the House and Senate for passing the agreement with overwhelming bipartisan support. The new trade deal with Canada and Mexico is a significant win for the U.S. steel industry, especially given the revamp of rules of origin that will greatly incentivize the use of North American steel and autos, auto parts and other products containing steel. All in all, we sense noticeably more optimism about the outlook for the U.S. economy as we head into 2020.","I would like now to share with you my most immediate priorities for our company, as I begin my tenure as Nucor's CEO. There are four key areas that we, as a leadership team, will focus on and execute on. First, we as a team, care for one another through the value of safety, to further strengthen our culture, which is a key driver of our success.","Secondly, the execution of the $3.5 billion of growth projects we are bringing online, execution begins with bringing these projects online safely and we have been doing that. Once they begin operating, we need to ensure that we stay focused on generating appropriate returns from these investments. All of these investments are focused on Nucor's goal of being the supplier of choice, both today and tomorrow. We are staying ahead of the curve in adding the high-value products that our customers are asking for.","Third, effective management of our portfolio of businesses to maximize our earnings potential. Ensuring our future success requires both making sound growth investments and addressing areas of underperformance. We will harness Nucor's culture of continuous improvement to achieve the full return potential across our entire asset base.","Finally, I have taken over the leadership of a company, whose ability to attract, retain and develop great people has always been key to our success. So, we will remain relentlessly focused on talent. Our team members create the true value in our company. We have more than a 90% retention rate and I believe we have the most engaged, passionate and driven team members in the world. ","We will continue to attract great team members by making sure the talent and passion of our team is more broadly recognized outside the company and we are committed to further enhancements of our programs to develop and retain our valuable team members. There will be more to come in all four of these areas as the year progresses, but I wanted to share these initial priorities with you today.","Let me conclude my prepared remarks this afternoon with an update on some of our more significant capital projects. We achieved important milestones on several of them during the quarter. At our DRI plant in Louisiana, the critical work of replacing the convection section of our process gas heater as well as realigning the reactor refractory was completed in November.","The work was done safely, on time and within budget. We expect these projects will further improve the plant's reliability. My thanks and congratulations to the team in Louisiana for their successful execution on this key phase of Project 8000 and for their performance in 2019, which was our second best year ever for uptime and output, despite the 70-day planned outage.","Two of our growth projects, our specialty cold mill complex at Nucor Steel Arkansas and the new galvanizing line at Nucor Steel Gallatin continued to ramp up production during the fourth quarter. Feedback from our customers on the product set of Gallatin and Hickman has been excellent. And now that we are operating, we have seen even more opportunities to align with our customers.","Utilization at Gallatin's galvanizing line is already over 50% and Hickman's new cold mill is operating 24\/7. We had contract customers for 31% of the new cold mill's capacity at year's end. Qualifications are ongoing and we expect to be IATF certified by mid 2020 at Hickman's new state-of-the-art reversing cold mill. ","Several other growth projects are coming online early in 2020 as well, including our new rebar micro mill in Sedalia, Missouri, the new merchant bar quality mill at Nucor Steel Kankakee and our JV galvanizing line located in Central Mexico that we are operating with JFE Steel of Japan.","We have arced both the EAF and LMF furnaces at Sedalia in recent days and our new teammates there are hitting the ground running. Already serving customers with product made from billets, we expect to ramp up to continue to go well. Kankakee experienced some delays in equipment deliveries in the permitting process, but we expect to come in at our initial capital budget of approximately $190 million. We expect to start shipping product during the second quarter.","At our joint venture with JFE in Mexico, we look forward to beginning trial shortly and serving our automotive customers in Central Mexico. The facility's opening has been delayed due to some challenges that we did not anticipate. For example, more difficult soil conditions required incremental piling, resulting in higher cost than budgeted. We also found that the local electrical system infrastructure was insufficient for our needs and decided to acquire additional land for our operational footprint.","These events increased the total capital budget from our initial estimate of $270 million to approximately $360 million with Nucor's share of these amounts being 50%. While this is disappointing, JFE and Nucor will remain very excited about the JV's prospects and are very confident in the product and our partnership. This is especially so, following the recent passage of the USMCA with its North American content rules.","Finally, we are excited to report that we have teammates on the ground and have begun excavation work for our new plate mill in Brandenburg, Kentucky. The mill is the largest investment in our company's history. And when it begins to operate in 2022, Nucor Steel Brandenburg will be able to produce 97% of the plate products demanded in the United States market.","With that, let me turn it over now to Jim Frias, who will discuss our financial results in greater detail.","James Frias","Thanks, Leon. Nucor reported fourth quarter of 2019 earnings of $0.35 per diluted share. Included in these results were non-cash impairment charges of $66.9 million or $0.17 per diluted share. Of that amount, $35 million or $0.09 per share related to our natural gas well assets, $20 million or $0.05 per diluted share related to a long-lived asset impairment in the steel mills segment and $11.9 million or $0.03 per share related to the writedown of certain intangible assets in the steel product segment. ","These results exceeded our fourth quarter of 2019 guidance range of $0.25 to $0.30 per share. The amounts of these non-cash impairment charges were not included at the time we issued our guidance on December 12.","Our fourth quarter included better-than-expected performance across most of the steel mills segment. Our fourth quarter results included approximately $35 million or $0.09 per diluted share, a pre-operating and start-up costs related to strategic investment projects. ","That compares to approximately $28 million in the third quarter of 2019 and approximately $17 million in the year-ago quarter. Excluding profits attributable to non-controlling interests, the effective tax rate was approximately 24.5% for the full-year. Going forward, we expect Nucor's effective tax rate to continue to be in the range of 24% to 25%, barring any unusual items.","In 2019's challenging steel market conditions, Nucor generated record operating cash flow of approximately $2.8 billion. Capital expenditures for 2019 totaled approximately $1.5 billion. For 2020, we expect capital spending to exceed $2 billion. Major components of this year's capital budget include the Brandenburg greenfield plate mill, the Gallatin sheet mill's hot band production capacity expansion, the Hickman sheet mill's new galvanizing line and our Florida rebar micro mill.","In addition to investing for long-term profitable growth, Nucor's disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation rewards our shareholders with attractive cash returns. Cash return to shareholders during 2019 totaled $791 million or 62% of net income for the year. We paid dividends of $492 million. We also repurchased approximately $299 million of our stock, about 5.3 million shares at an average cost of just over $56 per share. ","With the dividend increase announced in December, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 47 consecutive years, every year since it first began paying dividends in 1973. Over the 10-year period ending in 2019, Nucor has returned a total of more than $6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Our focus continues to be unaffected stewardship of our shareholders' valuable capital via both disciplined investments that we expect will generate returns, well in excess of our cost of capital as well as attractive cash returns to our shareholders. Nucor's financial condition remains strong.","We ended 2019 with $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. With total debt outstanding of approximately $4.3 billion, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 29% at the end of the fourth quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023. Our next significant debt maturity is in 2022 for approximately $600 million.","Now turning to the outlook. Nucor's earnings in the first quarter of 2020 are expected to increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. We are encouraged by improving conditions in the U.S. steel markets entering 2020. We believe this reflects the end of the severe inventory destocking that occurred last year and ongoing modest growth in end-use markets overall. We expect first quarter earnings in the steel mills segment to increase from the fourth quarter due to price increases and expected higher volumes.","It is worth noting that December, a historically weak month, was the highest profit month in the fourth quarter for our steel mills segment. The profitability of the steel product segment is expected to decrease as compared to the fourth quarter, due to normal seasonality. The performance of the raw material segment is expected to increase compared to the fourth quarter, due to improved pricing for raw materials. It is worth noting the outlook from an end-use markets perspective. We see stable or growing end-use markets, accounting for approximately 70% of our shipments.","Leon mentioned the strength of non-residential construction markets. We see this continuing into 2020. Non-residential is an important demand driver for our industry. Boat's order rates and backlogs are up across our Buildings group and in our joist and deck business. We are also hearing similar things from our structural fabrication customers. Nucor is the leading supplier of structural beams in the U.S., with the broadest product offering. It is a privilege to support our fabricated customers and important projects across the country.","Thank you for your interest in Nucor. I will now turn the call back over to Leon.","Leon Topalian","Thanks, Jim. At this time, we are now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from the line of Martin Englert with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Martin Englert","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","Leon Topalian","Good afternoon, Martin.","Martin Englert","So, you provided some commentary on the demand front and maybe if you could frame up what your expectations are for U.S. steel demand in 2020 versus last year, talking about some of the puts and takes among the end market? And then, also, based on the activity that you are seeing today in the order books, what is the sequential change might you be expecting within steel volumes in first quarter here?","Leon Topalian","Okay. Martin, let me begin first by stating how humbled and excited I am to be leading the Nucor team. I stand shoulder to shoulder with the greatest manufacturing team assembled anywhere in the world. And I'm surrounded with the most experienced executive team in the industry. And so, as I mentioned in the opening comments, we do see 2020 being a - shaping up to be a better year than 2019.","Non-res construction is strong. We believe destocking has really been completed, we have seen some of the restocking, but as we talk about order entry rates, there is a marked improvement in Q4, we see that continuing. Our backlogs are strong, as Jim mentioned in his comments. The fabrication community, their backlogs are very strong into 2020. So, we see the outlook is fairly optimistic as we move into 2020.","Martin Englert","Okay. And then, how - sorry, go ahead.","James Frias","Yeah, the second question was about the volumes we are anticipating in Q1 and we don't give that specific guidance, but I will say qualitatively, especially regarding our sheet business, we have had 15 straight weeks, where order significantly exceeded - I would say significantly, but more than 10% exceeded our production capacity and so we have built our backlog by about two weeks since the end of September, so about two weeks longer.","So, we are going to run the sheet business at least near full for the first quarter. The rest of our businesses have not really run full consistently for a number for a number of years, other than periodically once full, but we feel very confident sheet will run full. We are not going to give guidance about volume overall other than to maybe give that data point. I think, it is also worth noting that last week, the third week of January, was one of the strongest weeks of order input we have seen in sheet since the improvements began in mid-October.","Martin Englert","It sounds like a stronger start, maybe, on a sequential basis than what we have seen in the couple of past few years, though, based on your commentary?","James Frias","The only - maybe than last year. The year before that, it is going to be hard to beat. It has a pretty strong first quarter pick up in 2018.","Martin Englert","Okay, understood. And if I could one more, with growth CapEx increasing, could you touch on any need to draw on the revolver, perhaps, increase other debt to support the growth initiatives? And also, remind us of minimum cash balances and leverage targets for the Company?","James Frias","Sure. So, we are starting the year with a very strong liquidity position, $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. And so, we are going to have peak CapEx over the next two years and then it should taper off based on the projects we have announced and have in our pipeline actively today. And so, we could be slightly cash flow negative over the next two years. And then - but over the next five years, we would expect to be strong cash flow positive. So, right now, we would not expect to draw on the revolver. We would be more likely to issue CP if we got to that point, but with the $1.8 billion cushion, I don't see that likely this year.","Martin Englert","Okay. So rather other debt forms as opposed to the revolver if needed, but you don't anticipate that at this point?","James Frias ","That is correct. And again, we need about [$400 million to $500 million] (Ph) liquid cash. You asked that question, I didn't answer that part, just to sort of support the liquidity in the business.","Martin Englert","Okay, thanks for all the detail there and congratulations for a strong finish for the year.","James Frias ","Thank you.","Leon Topalian","Thank you, Martin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Terry","Hi, Leon and Jim, and congrats on the new role, Leon. A question I wanted to dig into a little bit more was on CapEx. You touched on that last question, but just a few more specifics, if I may. So, you said, I think, $2 billion around that level for 2020. You said $3.5 billion for your total projects. So, from the calculation we have done, we still got about $2.3 billion of that $3.5 billion still to spend. Can you maybe just give us some color on how we will - how 2021 will shape up as you go through the numbers and maybe after you have done these expansions, what the sustaining level would look like? Thank you.","James Frias ","Yeah. Our maintenance CapEx, we think of as being in the range of $500 million per year, as that is embedded in that more than $2 billion that we expect to spend in 2020. It is too early to say for 2021, but I think 2021 would be similar in levels to 2020, both years would be in the neighborhood of $2 billion or just north of there and then, it would be a fairly significant drop-off relative to the things that we have committed to get this point in time. We could, of course, identify other projects between now and then that would increase that. And the other thing is, each year, as part of year-end process, we have put up some slides that give color to our CapEx spending items and we will be putting those up today after the call on our website for investors to see.","Chris Terry","Okay, thanks for that. And that includes the - what is the additional spending for the paint line that you announced in December. I assume that is around the $100 million level or something in that ballpark?","Leon Topalian","Yeah, Chris, as we - and we are very excited about the announcement of our paint line and we are broadening our downstream offering to our customers. we have not released that number. As we are getting into the - kind of completing the engineering review, as we get that finalized, we will announce that to you and ensure that we do in the coming weeks.","Chris Terry","Okay, thanks for that. So, just to reiterate from the first question, so, you said through the next couple of years, you are comfortable funding the dividend and maintaining the business out till the CapEx drops off, you are comfortable managing sort of the capital management part of the business, even though the CapEx will be elevated for those two years.","Leon Topalian","That is correct, Chris.","James Frias ","Yeah, agreed.","Chris Terry","Okay. And the last one from me, just in terms of the new Missouri mill, just wondered if you could give a few more specifics on the ramp up of that. And then, just what you are seeing in the rebar market specifically? Thanks.","Leon Topalian","We are very excited about the strategy behind the micro mills, and I will ask Dave Sumoski here in a minute to maybe provide a little update on Sedalia specifically, but that investment strategy and our capital allocation philosophy to become and maintain the world-class position in rebar by serving those markets where our customers are at, a high propensity of the scrap, is critically important to us in maintaining that. Dave, anything you would like to update there?","David Sumoski","Yeah. The only thing I would add on that - I mean, you hit it, but if you look at just the nameplates, it would indicate that we are adding about 700,000 tons of additional rebar, but there is more to our strategy than that. We have a very deliberate process to realign our product mix in the bar group and in another groups, but specifically, you are talking about the bar group. And this includes producing higher value products at some of our - some of our other divisions and that process has begun. ","It has been thought for some period of time. And I will just share a couple of examples - Texas facility is now on pace to make about 150,000 tons of SBQ and our Darlington mill now makes about 300,000 tons of rod and when they add their degasser down there, it will move up the value chain even more on the rod market and they will start producing more SBQ.","So we are shifting rebar from some of our divisions to these new locations, where it makes more sense. At the end of the day, we are going to move up the value chain, but we will not abdicate, we will not abdicate markets and customers have been very good to us over the years. Specifically on the start-up, I am being told that we are going to melt the heat. ","We are going to go from melt shop all the way through the process on Thursday. we have already commissioned some of the proper - some of the processes and we run some billets through the line and we shipped 700 tons out of there from other divisions, just so we can get our ERP system up and working. That is where we are at it.","Leon Topalian","Thank you, David. Does that address your question, Chris?","Chris Terry","Yeah, that is great. Thanks guys. That is it from me.","Leon Topalian","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Timna Tanners","Hey, good afternoon. Happy new year, and Leon, I am looking forward to working with you.","Leon Topalian","Good afternoon. How are you, Timna.","Timna Tanners","All right, thanks. So, I just wanted to step back and ask a couple of high level questions, if I could. If we look at the steel products segment, profitability in 2019 is a step up from 2018. I am just trying to figure out how much if any of that was related to declining steel prices and how much might have been related to some of the growth projects? So if we look at 2020 for example, with 2018 under-earning and 2019 over-earning or should we consider it to being building from recent years?","Leon Topalian","Yeah, let me start up and I will frame it at the high level and maybe ask Chad Utermark or Jim to chime in. One of the areas, Tim, is that I mentioned in my opening comments was to really begin to look at how we scrutinize some of the businesses that we are not meeting our expectations. So one of the examples, I will share with you is in our products group, and Chad and his teams have done an amazing job of rationalizing a market that for many years was about two million tons that shifted down over the last six or seven years to about 1.2 million tons. ","So we moved operations, combined different manufacturing plants and brands within the same plants and really brought the market needs to fit our supply framework. And by doing so, it is really created a very positive cash position. So I would say that impact is in the result of the team achieving a record year is largely based on those decisions that we made as opposed to just the declining steel prices, which did have some factor. But Chad, anything you would like to add on that?","Chad Utermark","Yeah, thanks Leon. Yeah, thanks Timna for recognizing that. Obviously, lower raw material costs, as well as the solid non-res construction market that we had, had an impact in a positive way to some of the record we set. But that record performance of the fabricated steel products segment is also benefiting from what Leon just talked about, this restructure in particular of our metal buildings business as well as rebar fabrication business. ","We are seeing the results, the restructure is resulting in a lower cost structure, some of the capital investments in new equipment changes to our process flow and the volume impact associated especially with metal building group, producing multiple brands at the same plant is really paying off. So we are excited, I think there is even further opportunity for us going forward for us to improve our performance downstream.","Leon Topalian","Yes, the thing I would add, Timna, is this. We took some of the rewards from the changes we have made to those businesses that Chad talked about metal buildings and rebar fabrication, but we expect to reap further rewards from those changes in 2020. And so we are optimistic that 2020 is likely to be a better year. ","The other thing I would say is our tube business, which we built through three acquisitions a couple of years ago, didn't have its best year. They were much better in 2018 than they were in 2019. We expect that business to do better in 2020 as well. So, we think 2020 should be a pretty decent year for us in steel products.","Timna Tanners","Okay, super. And then I kind of want to ask the same questions about raw materials and long products, because 2018 is a really good year, 2019 was a not-so-good year in all those categories and especially for raw materials, there is been so much fluctuation like how should we think about normal EBITDA per ton or margin per ton or however you want to think about it? And same question for volumes in the long products like they fell off in 2019 and so trying to think about how some of these expansions or enhancements can result in better 2020? Thanks for that.","Leon Topalian","Okay. Again, so I got the raw materials and the long products, and again. I will maybe ask Craig to chime in here. But at the end of the day, the longs business for us is a very profitable sector of our business. Market leadership in beams allows us to operate in the roughly 65% to 70% range through most of 2018. But again, as we talked about in sheet, and Jim mentioned, specifically both plate and beams, we have also seen a market shift in order entries and backlogs. And so we are seeing that market improve from 2019. Again, I think a factor of that is the destocking that took place throughout 2019.","And as we move into 2020, I think you will see a much more level in tempered business conditions as we move through whether it is scrap or order entry rates. We believe we will be more stabilized as we hit 2020. I think 2018, we saw our customers overbuying demand. In 2019, we saw them under-buying, I think you will see that more balance.","But Craig, maybe you would add some color on the raw materials.","Craig Feldman","Sure. Thank you, Leon. Yes, Timna, no doubt about it. The margin compression we talked about on prior calls, particularly the DRI plants has been real, it is on both sides. It is on the supply side, and of course, our selling prices were challenged in 2019. ","Going forward, we really don't share EBITDA per ton numbers in that regard in the raw materials group for VRI, what I would just characterize that this a lot of the heavy lifts that we have done over the last year or so, and we have highlighted Project 8,000, a number of times on the call, and the improvements that we made really focused on reliability going forward.","So by the middle of the year, I would say that we will toward a more normalized run rate, I suspect that we will see some relief on the iron ore pricing standpoint as well. And we feel very good about the work that we have done related to CapEx and improving the reliability going forward.","The team in Louisiana has moved from between 250 tons an hour close than 280 tons an hour, so we feel very good about the operational improvements that we have made there, and generally speaking, you don't know where markets will grow, but fairly positive outlook, once we get past the first half of this year.","David Sumoski","Yes, this is Dave. I just make one comment on the longs. If you are just looking at bars and the numbers there, two different businesses, so you got the SPG product and then you get a rebar in the MBQ product. And on the rebar and MBQ product, 2018 was a great year, but we are tracking ahead of 2017. So, if you look at that year on the pure bar side. So that industry or that business is supported by the construction industry and that is why we still feel there is a strong construction market out there moving forward.","Picking on engineered bar, excuse me, engineered bar kind of lives in our view in a different ecosystem. We don't really sell into the construction market. A couple of our major markets, oil and gas and ag equipment, we are actually down, we have to combine factors of destocking with both OEMs in service centers. So, despite that our engineered bar group, special bar quality picked up share in 2020 - in 2019, excuse me. So, again, not construction related, but a different market situation. So, excuse me, Timna, continue your point, please.","Timna Tanners","Oh, no, not at all. I just trying to make sure I understood. So it sounds like 2018 tough comp versus 2019 you expect, not the same destocking, better volumes and then sprinkle in some organic improvements, and that is how we should be thinking about 2020?","Leon Topalian","Yes, it is. I think underlying demands is there. I think it is stable and some of the sectors that Dave and both where I mentioned, construction in particular was strong and we are seeing some slight improvements year-over-year.","Timna Tanners","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Curt Woodworth ","Yes, good afternoon. I guess my first question, I guess, I mean Nucor has had a pretty consistent operating philosophy for a long time, that seems like the company has definitely sort of accelerated more of the build for spot mentality with a lot of CapEx. So, I'm just curious with new leadership that are coming, this new perspective, new opportunities. What do you see kind of changing at Nucor? Where do you think the most opportunity for improvement lies? And how do you think your - maybe near-term agenda will be different from prior attendance? It is my first question.","Leon Topalian","Okay, Curt, I would frame it up this way. It is not easier for me to talk about those things that are not going to change. Our focus on our core, our culture is going to remain very much intact. How we care for our 27,000 men and women of the Nucor family is critically important. They are the value generators for our future. The $3.5 billion of investment projects we have slated are equipment or things that can be bought. ","Our team is what revolutionizes and changes the market and the returns that they are able to achieve. And so I couldn't be prouder of our team and we are laser focused after the value of safety curve on executing on that $3.5 billion. It is the second focus for our entire organization and we bring those projects in safely on time and ahead of schedule. And so that is where our focus is at.","And then third, we move to really the portfolio management. How do we continue to think about growth in the short and medium term and long-term, and then coupling that with how do we scrutinize those businesses that have not returned the levels of profits and shareholder returns, we have come to expect of ourselves and the investors have come to expect of us.","So, based on those focus, I would tell you that there is not a shift in what - how John led or Dan DiMicco led. What I would tell you is the destinations are very similar. The routes we may take to get there might be slightly different than the all of us use ways or Google Maps to get into the city. I may go to New York City five different ways, five days in a row. But how I communicate or the things that we do to achieve the result, the results are focused on the safety of our team and executing really well on the valuable shareholder capital that they entrust us with every day.","Curt Woodworth ","Okay, that makes sense. And then I guess, with respect to capital bending and sort of dating myself a little bit here, but if I look at your plate capacity since 2005, it is been pretty consistent around 2.8 million tons and your 15-year utilization rate has been about 80%, and you were at roughly 70% for last two quarters. So I'm wondering, tactically, if we get into a demand situation where the plate stays - demand stays week, would you contemplate postponing plate mill CapEx?","Leon Topalian","Let me begin with the short answer, no, is the short answer. The longer answer is, we have been in this business now for 20 years, Curt. We understand the markets that we serve, we understand the customer base that is asking for this. And this is something that we contemplated since going back in 2008. So, our focus is for the long term. We understand there is going to be ebbs and flows in the markets. It is a cyclical business, and it is a business we know well, and we have been in and a part for over 50 years.","So as we think about plate, the only side of the fact that we will have the most diverse product offering of any mill in one location located in the heart of the largest plates consumable region, the United States. And so by doing so, we really believe we have a differentiated value proposition to offer our customer base that puts us in a low cost position, a market leadership position. And I'm incredibly encouraged by what Mary Emily and Johnny Vegas and the team at Brandenburg willing and be able to do in our future in plates.","Curt Woodworth ","Great, thanks. And best of luck in the future.","Leon Topalian","Thanks, Curt.","Operator","Thank you. We will next go to Andrew Cosgrove with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please go ahead.","Andrew Cosgrove","Hi, thanks for taking my question. To start off and see if you could shed some light on the non-residential exposure by product on your sheet, bar, plate and structural, if that is helpful?","Leon Topalian","Give me a little more color. I'm trying to follow your question.","Andrew Cosgrove","I'm just trying to square up just the exposure to whether sheet, bar, plate, and structural in the non-res segment. I mean, the only reason why I asked is, because just trying to make sense of, I mean long products and I mean all lines are down pretty precipitously in 2019, non-res construction was up low single digits, I understand there were some destocking, but I guess, I'm just trying to see it non-res is still going to be strong and we are not going to get destocking and we will probably get restocking this year, where that might be felt the most?","Leon Topalian","Look, I would tell you certainly, I think in a rebar, rebar fabrication businesses that are heavily put into the construction market and certainly some of the structural capacity that we have is a big part of that. And then the downstream products and building and - are all factors in non-res construction. So that is the biggest side of the markets, we serve roughly about 30% of our overall products move into that space.","But one of the things you mentioned, I would maybe characterize a little bit differently. We think some of the restocking is already occurred. And again, as we mentioned earlier in our comments, I do believe you will see a more balanced approach to 2020 in terms of both service internally and buying patterns. And so, we do believe demand is healthy and we are optimistic too as we head into 2020.","Dave, is there something you would like to add?","David Sumoski","Yes. I would just add that although there is no federal infrastructure bill out there, the states are really stepping up to the plate and they are doing a lot of work. So that is really going to boost in the non-residential construction markets. So, I just wanted to add that.","Andrew Cosgrove","Okay. Perfect, thank you. And then I guess one on plate, I mean plate import last year were down 20-ish percent and then obviously the plate shipments were also down 12%. I guess, I was just trying to again that also just down to destocking or is there, I guess maybe if you could give some color on specific end markets where there was some weakness in plate specifically and maybe how you kind of see them shaping up right now?","Leon Topalian","Well, look I will start it and maybe you can chime in if there is anything else. But as we think about the plate and the import levels, I would tell you one of the most impactful things is what we been able to do over the last couple of years. We won 12 trade cases since 2016 in plate, that has dramatically shifted the import coming into this country.","Certainly, 232 has helped, however, it is the long-term of the trade cases that we have won and something over 160 cases that we have won, some dating back in plates in 1999. So, our position through the long-term ICC and the Department of Commerce and commandment for what they have done and are doing. But that site has got to remain very vigilant. And so, that is a big part of why you saw the drop off in plate imports.","MaryEmily, anything you would like to add on?","MaryEmily Slate","Just a little bit color on that. You are right. We had the lowest level of imports in the last five years, last year which was great. And we do believe the overall market retracted, but mainly that was due to destocking activity. And we mentioned trade cases, there are still 17 active trade cases going on. So for 2020, we really look for the activity to be consistent. We feel like we are looking at a decent 2020 going forward. Thank you.","Andrew Cosgrove","Okay, great. Thanks so much and best of luck this year.","Leon Topalian","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. We will next go to Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Phil Gibbs","Hey, good afternoon.","Leon Topalian","Good afternoon, Phil.","Phil Gibbs","Welcome to the helm Leon, congratulations.","Leon Topalian","Thank you very much. Very excited and very humble.","Phil Gibbs","In terms of the rebar color, it sound like, you are just getting the Missouri mill started in the last week or two. What is your thought around the ramp timeline there? And then, can you give us any color on the Florida mill as well, because I know that was something that was supposed to be around mid-2020?","Leon Topalian","Certainly. On a high level thought, what I would tell you Phil is, the Micro mill in Sedalia is coming online as we speak to team, it has done a great job and taken care of the team from safety perspective, operating costing and schedule. So, we are excited about that. And then, in the micro mill in Frostproof, Florida, is still slated to come online in summer of this year.","So, the other part of that, maybe I will ask Jim to frame some color, because we do think about how are these investments returning and what is that long-term outlook, maybe Jim, you could add some color to those projects.","James Frias ","First of all, specific to your question, I think it is likely that Sedalia reaches breakeven sometime in Q2. And overall, the galv line at Gallatin is already making the positive contribution. We have pre-operating start-up costs in the quarter, I think it was $36 million in the fourth quarter, that is going to come down slightly in Q1, because some of these projects are starting to ramp. ","The Hickman cold mill is starting to ramp. So, their pre-operating start-up costs come down as they go toward breakeven. Sedalia is going to start to have its pre-operating start-up costs and come down as they strive toward breakeven.","Now, later in the year, we will probably have other projects increase the pace of pre-operating start-up costs. But, the projects that are coming online right now and that includes the galv line at Gallatin, the Hickman cold mill, the Sedalia bar mill and the Kankakee merchant bar mill. Those four are going to make a nice contribution to Nucor by the end of this year and a really good contribution to Nucor next year. ","And we get in the broader numbers that the cumulative projects have $600 million of EBITDA value. I would just say, if you do the math on the CapEx of those projects, you will see a nice jump and that EBITDA is going to benefit Nucor in 2021, and we will start to see some of that fruit by the end of this year.","Phil Gibbs","At a high level, Jim, the start-up costs, saying they are coming down a little bit sequentially here in the first quarter, but you are expecting the pre-operating start-up costs in total to be lower in 2020 than the 2019 or is that not a fair statement?","James Frias ","No, I would say it is too early to say because we got two big projects getting ramped, and because they are bigger, they will have bigger pre-operating start-up costs. So, the expansion of capacity at Gallatin and the Brandenburg mill, when they come on, it is going to probably greatly increase our pre-operating start-up costs for a period of time. ","And we don't forecast that out more than one quarter at a time, so I can't tell you what those numbers are. Other than Q1, it probably going to be slightly down. But I would expect for the year, it might actually be slightly up because of those two bigger projects starting to ramp up the costs.","Phil Gibbs","Okay. Fair enough. And then, the comment I think you made Jim on being cash flow negative for the next couple of years given the CapEx, are you throwing in the dividend in that discussion, meaning you are including the dividend in terms of that you are being cash flow negative?","James Frias ","Yes. Dividend plus CapEx against operating, or cash from operations.","Phil Gibbs","Okay. So, you are not saying free cash flow negative, you are just saying after dividend or are we seeing free cash flow negative?","James Frias ","I'm saying after CapEx and dividends.","Phil Gibbs","Okay. And then lastly, just in terms of first quarter, so we are thinking about this right. Seemingly some operating leverage at least in the sheet division from better volumes in Q1, but overall as we look at the steel business, should we think that realizing metal spreads will be a positive contributor versus the fourth quarter?","Leon Topalian","Yes, I think so, Phil. And again, as we look at scrapping, and obviously an awful lot of discussions. Craig, may want to add some color here, but the market demand standpoint is still strong. And I think one of the drivers that is not discussed an awful lot as we look at scrap, it is really the export market and the demand outside of the U.S. It has an impact on those.","So, Craig, anything do you want to add on the raw material stuff side?","Craig Feldman","Yes, just in general, I would say that there was a lot of commentary around the interest in the spare market as it looks - I think the key drivers is fuel demand and to Leon's comments and the rest of the teams, I think you would hear a fair amount of optimism here. And that is what we are seeing, we are seeing the domestic demand for scrap is relatively strong. So, absent the normal gyrations in the market, I would say, can we see a fairly relatively stable place environment, and again, driven by the steel demand, underlying steel demand.","Phil Gibbs","Thanks so much. That is a lot.","Leon Topalian","Phil, just one point I want to clarify, I made the statement earlier that Frostproof was expected to come online this summer. We will start commissioning, but it will really come online in Q4 of this year.","Phil Gibbs","Perfect. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. We will next move to Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead.","Alex Hacking","Good afternoon, and let me add my congratulations Leon on the new role. I just have one question. Jim, I just have a follow-up on the CapEx guidance really just to make sure I was straight, I think you said 2021, you would be $2 billion-ish similar to 2020. If we take out $500 million a year for sustaining, that is about $3 billion on growth projects for the next two years. I guess that seems a little high compared to what we were thinking. We were thinking total budget of around $3.5 billion, with about $2.5 billion left to spend. I mean, I guess, can you help me pull that gap a little bit? I know you mentioned that...","James Frias ","There are some projects that aren't big enough that we forced to call out that are embed in there as well, there are improvement projects that we don't think of as being CapEx, but they are not building new mill type projects, so we don't call them out. So, there is some other CapEx in there for things that are improvement projects as well.","Alex Hacking","Okay, it makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And it does appear we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Leon Topalian for any additional or closing remarks.","Leon Topalian","Thank you, Derek. Before concluding our call today, I want to express our appreciation to our shareholders. We value your investment in our company. We take the obligation seriously that comes with it. And we will treat your investment with great care. I also want to thank our customers.

Please go ahead, sir.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. We appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team, Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; Chief Digital Officer, Joe Stratman; and our other Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Dave Sumoski, Chad Utermark and Nucor\u2019s newest EVP, Leon Topalian.","Leon is a 21-year veteran of our company and will be a strong addition to our executive team. He has responsibility for our beam and plate mills. Leon is a proven leader with experience in our sheet, raw materials, bar and beam businesses. Since 2014 he has severed as General Manager of Nucor-Yamato Steel Company. Thoughtful and orderly succession planning continues to be a significant, strategic initiative throughout the Nucor organization. In addition to Leon\u2019s promotion, we shifted responsibilities among several of our Executive Vice Presidents to broaden their experience.","Chad Utermark, is now responsible for our Fabricated Construction Products; Ray Napolitan, is leading our Engineered Bar Products; Joe Stratman is focused exclusively on his responsibilities as our Chief Digital Officer; while Jim Darsey, assumes responsibility for raw materiels. Dave Sumoski, is leading our Merchant and Rebar Products Group; Ladd Hall, continues to be responsible for our sheet mills. The leadership team in Charlotte would like to thank all of our teammates throughout Nucor for their excellent work in the first half of 2017 to build a safer, stronger and more profitable Nucor. You are the reason our Company\u2019s best years are still ahead of us. Thank you.","Our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias will now review Nucor\u2019s second quarter performance and financial position. Following those comments, I\u2019ll update you on the execution of our strategy for the long-term profitable growth. Jim?","Jim Frias","Thanks John. Nucor reported second quarter 2017 earnings of $1 diluted share. These results were at the low end of our guidance range given mid-June of $1 to $1.05 per diluted share. Nucor\u2019s second quarter performance represents a significant improvement compared to year ago second quarter earnings of $0.76 per diluted share. But it declined from first quarter of 2017 earnings of $1.11 per diluted share.","Our earnings for the first half of 2017 of $2.11 per diluted share represent Nucor\u2019s highest earnings for this period since the cyclical peak of 2008. This performance was achieved despite intensifying pressure from illegally traded steel imports. How we are able to do this is very easy to explain. Nucor\u2019s disciplined strategy for profitable growth is working. We are realizing significant returns from our growth investments made during the steel industry\u2019s protracted downturn.","Over the past eight years Nucor has invested more than $7 billion. Capital spending of $5 billion and more than $2 billion of acquisitions, continuing a long tradition of our company we have invested aggressively to increase our capabilities for delivering value to our customers and profitable growth for our shareholders.","Compared with the first quarter of 2017, our second quarter earnings benefited from significantly improved performance at our direct reduced iron plate mill, rebar fabrication and metal buildings businesses. Although down somewhat in the first quarter level, our sheet mills delivered solid profitability driven by their success in expanding their value-added product offerings and customer relationships. Compared against the year-ago quarter, profitability improved at our sheet, SBQ and plate mills, as well as our raw material businesses.","The profitability of our downstream steel products segment declined significantly year-over-year, due to margin compression resulting from a highly competitive market environment and higher steel prices. Surges of dumped and subsidized rebar imports dramatically reduced the performance at our rebar mills and rebar fabrication operations.","A quick comment about our tax rate as it can be confusing due to the impact of profits from non-controlling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was 34% for the second quarter and 33.2% for year-to-date 2017.","Nucor\u2019s financial position remains strong. With total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 33% at the end of the second quarter. Cash and short term investments totalled approximately $1.6 billion. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until April of 2021.","For 2017, we estimate capital spending of approximately $500 million and depreciation and amortization of about $730 million.","Earnings in the third quarter of 2017 are expected to be comparable to the range of the first half of 2017\u2019s quarterly earnings. This further supports our previously expressed view that full year 2017 profitability could significantly exceed the level achieved for 2016.","Our fabricated construction products order books continue to indicate a favorable outlook for the nonresidential construction market over the balance of 2017. We're also encouraged by the emergence of improving demand in other end-use markets, including energy and heavy equipment. Although automotive market demand is pulling back somewhat historically high levels, we expect to continue Nucor\u2019s growth in this market as we gain share.","We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages, highly adaptable business model and proven strategies will allow our team to continue to deliver profitable long term growth and attractive returns to Nucor's shareholders. It all begins with making sound capital allocation decisions. Nucor\u2019s capital allocation priorities are clear and they have been consistently practiced over many years. Our first priority is to invest for profitable long-term growth. This strategy is simple and flexible. We are leveraging Nucor\u2019s five drivers to profitable growth.","Our second priority is to return cash to our shareholders primarily with cash dividends consistent with our success in delivering long-term earnings growth. Nucor has increased its space dividend for 44 consecutive years. We believe that record is strong evidence of both the sustainability of our business and our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase our stock when our cash position is strong and our shares are attractively price.","Thank you for your interest in our company. John?","John Ferriola","Thanks Jim. Nucor\u2019s disciplined strategy for profitable growth is working. As Jim noted, our second quarter and first half of 2017 earnings represent Nucor\u2019s best performances since the cyclical peak year of 2008. In fact our second quarter of 2017 earnings of $323 million are more than double Nucor\u2019s average second quarter earnings of $150 million achieved during the 2010 to 2016 time period. Our first half of 2017 earnings of $680 million are nearly tripled Nucor\u2019s average first half earnings of $246 million reported over the 2010 to 2016 period. But what pleases me the most is that the more than 24,000 men and women on the Nucor team are delivering profitable growth despite a renewed flood of illegally traded imports into the United States.","Here are the numbers that demonstrate the severity of this headwind. Through the first half of 2017, finished steel imports have increased an estimated 15% compared to the same period last year. The estimated finished steel import market share in the months of June 2017 was 29%, matching the record annual level set in 2015. The year-to-date market share for finished steel imports stands at approximately 27%. This is further evidence that traditional trade cases are very often too slow to keep up with the shifting tactics of nations that are abusing the rules of trade. Nucor continues to believe significant work remains to be done to achieve truly effective and timely enforcement of U.S. trade laws. It\u2019s time for comprehensive and broad based remedies that address years of illegal foreign trade practices that have weakened our nation\u2019s economic vitality and our national security.","We recommend remedies to be targeted to measurable goals steel import share of U.S. market and our industry\u2019s capacity utilization. It is also critical that appropriate adjustments be made to the remedies if policy targets are not reached. While we may require a trial and error process, to determine what remedies are affected. We are confident that our nation\u2019s leaders will stay in the course until there is free and fair trade in our steel markets.","The Nucor team\u2019s advocacy for trade law enforcement is an absolutely critical to our mission of taking care of our customers, our employees and our shareholders. Effective trade law enforcement is required for free and fare completion or trade free on the market distorting practices of some governments. Nucor always drives in a marketplace where winners are determined by real economic advantages earned by efficiency and innovation. Truly free trade is the only path to global prosperity and rising standards of living for everyone. In the current challenging environment, we are encouraged but not satisfied by our second quarter and first half of 2017 performance. ","The Nucor team remains ready and eager to realize the significant pent-up earnings power we have built with the more than $7 billion invested during the steel industry\u2019s lengthy downturn. To that goal, our focus remains on what is under our control. The execution of our disciplined strategy for long-term profitable growth. The strategy is simple and flexible. We are leveraging Nucor\u2019s five drivers to profitable growth. The five drivers are: strengthen our position as a low-cost producer; achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher quality, higher margin to products, expand and leverage our downstream channels to market to increase our steel mill\u2019s base load volume for sustained results and achieve commercial excellence to compliment our traditional, operational strength.","I will now update you on highlights of our team's recent progress implementing our strategy for profitable growth. During the second quarter we announced a $176 million investment to build a hot band galvanizing line at our sheet mill in Kentucky. This will expand Nucor Steel Gallatin's product capabilities and have an annual capacity of approximately 500,000 tons. The 72-inch galvanizing line will be the widest hot-rolled galvanizing line in North America. This project will allow us to expand into segments of the automotive market we currently do not serve growing applications of hot band galvanized for frames, control arms, supports and brackets. It will also create synergies with Nucor's other sheet mills. Acquired in October of 2014, our Gallatin sheet mill has proven to be an excellent platform for profitable growth. Thanks to the hard work of our Gallatin team members. Thank you, and please keep it going.","In late June, Nucor-JFE Steel Corporation of Japan began construction of our equally owned joint venture galvanizing facility located in Mexico. Nucor has been doing business with Mexico for more than a decade and is excited by this opportunity to expand our participation in that country's growing automotive market. At the same time we are extremely pleased to partner with a premier supplier of high-quality steel products to the global automotive market. The plant will cost approximately $270 million and have an annual capacity for 400,000 tons. Nucor will supply half of the substrate requirements from our sheet mills. Operations are expected to begin in the second half of 2019.","The automotive market is an attractive, long-term growth opportunity for Nucor. Our automotive shipments grew by 50% over the three-year period and in 2016 to 1.4 million tons. With our current mid-single-digits percentage share of the automotive sheet steel market, there is still plenty of room for us to grow. In a slowing automotive environment, Nucor continues to take market share from our competitors.","After receiving additional customer awards this year for future model year 2017, 2018 and 2019, Nucor is on pace to achieve two million ton automotive annual shipment rate goal by the end of 2018. Demonstrating that our automotive growth strategy is working, we recently received recognition from Volkswagen with an award given to their best suppliers. The award criteria are innovative strange, product quality, development competency, sustainability and professional project management. Volkswagen recognized a total of 19 suppliers. Nucor was the only steel supplier and one of only two U.S.-based suppliers to receive this prestigious award.","Our newest growth platform, Nucor two-wheeler products, continues to deliver strong profitability. Acquired in late 2016 and early 2017, these producers serve the hollow structural sections, or HSS and the electrical conduit niches of the pipe and tube market. These value-added businesses squarely hit the target on all five of Nucor\u2019s strategic drivers to profitable growth. Representing an attractive channel to market for Nucor's hot-rolled sheet steel, they are on track to source nearly 100% of their steel substrate for Nucor's sheet mills in the fourth quarter of this year. Congratulations and thank you to our two-wheeler products and sheet mill teammates for your excellent work. Please keep it going.","These are just some of the exciting initiatives we are implementing to drive profitable growth. We continue to make excellent progress on a number of other projects across our steelmaking, downstream and raw material businesses.","For a company such as Nucor with its unique position of strength and proven ability to execute its strategy for profitable growth, this is the time of great opportunity. That's why the Nucor team is both ready and eager to unleash the pent-up earnings power that we have built into our company during the industry downturn. I am absolutely confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us.","We appreciate your interest in a Nucor and we would now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Novid Rassouli with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Novid Rassouli","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. On the long products side, given the import pressure that we're seeing on long products and with scrap looking maybe potentially stable, how do you guys think about margins going into the back half of the year for long products?","John Ferriola","Long products are definitely challenged due to the import surge that we've seen, most notably in our rebar business but certainly also in our merchant business. And you're correct, we do see scrap pricing going out for the next couple of months to be somewhat stable, maybe softening a little bit, but pretty stable. Now having said that, we've got trade cases going on today on rebar, and we fully expect to have successful outcomes on and we believe will help steel with import surge over the next few months. But hoping that to be the case. If it is, we should see a reduction in the imports and with that, improvement in the market and demand for rebar in the United States.","Novid Rassouli","Thanks and then my second question is a follow-up on that. In your opinion what long product or products do you think are most likely to be included in a Section 232 proposal? Thanks guys.","Joe Stratman","It is really difficult to say. What we are looking to have happened and what we were executing in Washington. And frankly what we hopeful we will get is a very broad based 232 ruling that will include virtually all of the products. It will not be targeted to any one particular product or to any one particular geographical area, or region of the world. So based on that, our expectations, certainly, our hope and with some degree of confidence, we believe that we will get a 232 that is inclusive of all of the products.","Novid Rassouli","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jorge Beristain","Hey guys it\u2019s Guys it's Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Question was on the guidance or color you've given for second half. It does seem light. You're kind of saying that 3Q should be similar to what we saw in the first half, but we've just seen a $25 price hike that seems to be followed by your industry peers. And you had mentioned scrap prices are probably going to be stable to down, and you might see some volume pickup in the second half due to 232. So trying to understand why you would be cautious on the second half outlook?","John Ferriola","Well I'd say that we're optimistically cautious. Of course, we'll just be optimistic as we look out into the quarter. There's always a great deal of uncertainty in our business, well I would say a couple of business. We\u2019re not sure exactly what's going to happen out there. Over the next couple of months we will certainly learn what\u2019s going to happen with 232. That could have a very significant impact. My take on it, frankly, right now is it's probably not going to be everything we hope it to be, but it\u2019s certainly going to be more than what we have right now. ","So as I look out into the third quarter and I see pricing seems to be holding and improving in Flat-Rolled Products, stability in our other businesses in terms of demand, a scrap number that is stable going forward and potentially some help on 232 and even failing that, I do expect to have continued successes we've seen over the last 12 months on the ongoing cases, the ongoing trade cases, particularly as they apply to long products. We've seen success in plate. We expect to have some more success in plate.","And as we look out into the quarter, you've got to remember that a lot of the bookings are already placed. A lot of our sheet businesses on the contract that\u2019s predicated upon CRU numbers from the previous quarter. So when we factor all of that into what we see, at least at the beginning of the third quarter, relatively same performance as in the first half of the year. As you go out further into the year, as I said before, we are cautiously optimistic and we'll see improvement both in demand and in some outcomes out of Washington.","Jorge Beristain","Okay. Sorry. If I could just squeak another question in for Jim, just on corporate illuminations, we saw them jump about $40 million sequentially. I was just wondering if you could comment on that. I thought we were going to see a lower impact from these kinds of eliminations going forward and they actually went up. ","Jim Frias","Yes, that\u2019s a great question. And the biggest change was related to intercompany profit eliminations related to our DRI raw material business. We have more DRI inventory at the end of the second half than we had at the beginning of the first half, and the margins on that product were increased and we have to eliminate the profits till it comes out at the end as a finished product. And that means not just as a finished steel product business, this is a finished piece of decking if it goes to a deck plant or some part of another steel thing that we've fabricate, piping, tube, et cetera.","But overall we look at that number, if we look on the year-to-date basis its $410 million versus $286 million last year. There's two big things that have driven it up year-over-year. One is profitability and how that effects profit sharing. Profit sharing, for our non-officer employees is higher than it was last year by almost $53 million, and intercompany profit eliminations are higher by $68 million. And you're right. Sequentially, quarter-to-quarter, there is a jump and most of that was intercompany profit related to all of our products but mainly, DRI.","Jorge Beristain","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Korn with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matthew Korn","Thank you. Good afternoon everybody.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon.","Matthew Korn","Another question on trade and imports if I could. If policy relief on imports that you had talked about for whatever reason, it doesn't materialize in the near term and say, the rebar market continues to suffer under import pressure it has been. Does that change the calculus for you at all on say, the investment in Marion?","And then bigger picture with any of the investment plans that you are currently forming will any of them be predicated on your getting trade relief. Could you see yourself in the position of saying look we have to adapt parts of our long held strategy for growth in the domestic market unless we get more assurance from the government on this really important topic?","John Ferriola","Well let me start by saying absolutely not. We work on what we can control, we focus on what we have under our control. And that\u2019s what we predicate our business plans upon, and on investment strategies upon and that is what we have built them upon. We know what we can control. We know what we can import. We can influence what happens in Washington. We cannot control them. So our focus has always been on what we can control. The investment strategies that we've made, the plans that we've laid out. I'd be happy to talk about them if you want more detail on them.","But it's been part of our strategy since our company began to invest for the long term. We are long term-focused company. The investments we make are for the long term. The things that happen over the next couple of months in terms of what comes out of Washington and I understand there's a lot of focus on that. To me, that's icing on the cake, that's gravy, that's something that whatever comes out \u2013 and I'm sure that with something coming out that's beneficial, but what level remains to be seen but it will be beneficial. Whatever does come out will be a positive to the plans that we've already laid out that we're confident will continue to focus on long term, profitable growth.","Jim Frias","Does that answers your question?","Matthew Korn","Yes sir, I appreciate that. It does. Let me then take you up on your offer and if you could give me any latest update on the progress there, especially cold mill there in Arkansas. How's that coming along?","John Ferriola","Will I\u2019ll be a little bit broader if I can. We\u2019ve been talking about that one specifically. Its well, going extremely well. It's right on \u2013 it\u2019s early in the process, but certainly, it's right on track. And we have that cold mill going in at Hickman. That is going to do wonders to advance us even higher than we are currently in the value-added automotive market. It's a very specialized mill. It's a third-generation, ultrahigh strengths. That will allow us to continue the progress that we've made, the outstanding progress that we've made in penetrating automotive. That will then be further supplemented by our automotive-quality gal-line in Mexico, with our partners at JFE. As you know, those guys are premier, automotive suppliers known on a global basis.","For them to be partners with us, is just a credit to what our team has done in terms of advancing and to automotive, the quality and service that we have been able to deliver. You add that to another investment we're making at our Gallatin facility, another gal line. So we did a very just a hot band gal line. It's ultra-wide, it will be the widest in North America. It's extremely heavy gauged. Frankly, it's just about twice as heavy that's produced currently today in the Midwest, which is a great market for galvanized, a growing market.","So you add all of this together, we've got a very well-focused \u2013 and I'm \u2013 it's too early to share some of the other plans that we have on our long product side. But I can assure you that we are really developing a long-term strategy to deal with some of the issues that are happy to tell you long products.","So altogether, answering your question, we've got a definitive plan for long-term profitable growth. We're executing on it well, and it's not influenced by what's coming out of Washington. It's influenced by what we can control. And whatever comes out of Washington will be gravy for us as we go forward.","Matthew Korn","Thanks for the comment John.","Operator","And next you will hear from Seth Rosenfeld with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Seth Rosenfeld","Good afternoon. Two questions. Starting out on the hot-rolled coil market, you earlier referenced increased competition in HRC as being a key drag in the second quarter. Would you attribute this behavior principally to importers? Or are you also seeing more aggressive behavior from domestic peers, being some the new entrants, like Big River in Mingo? And in more recent weeks, as pricing is begin to stabilize and actually recover, are you seeing any notable shift in that competitor behavior? I'll stop there, please.","John Ferriola","Sure. Well, we always worry more about the imports. Frankly, there's new competition coming on domestic competition. We've been living with that for the last 40 to 50 years. We're going to live with it for more years going forward. And frankly, we welcome that competition. We enjoy good competition on a fast, level playing field. We do not fear competition on a level playing field. We are confident in our team's ability given a level playing field to be successful without a doubt. So more of those comments are focused on the import situation.","And when I look at the different markets that we are participating in and the advantages that we have in some of those markets, automotive, construction, energy, just being a bunch of \u2013 just a couple of names to put out there. We are very confident in our ability to compete extremely well against domestic competitors on a level playing field. The challenge that we have and we will continue to fight, and I know that we will continue to have more success on is with imported products.","Seth Rosenfeld","Thank you. And then the second question on the rebar fabrication side, your comment seemed quite dire, I suppose, in terms of where you see profitability for that business. Following the recently announced antidumping duties early in the year, has that, at all, changed your competitive behavior and the level of margins that you seeing in the fab side?","John Ferriola","Well, I certainly didn't use the word dire, okay? Challenged, maybe, okay, but not dire. And once again, you're spot on with your follow-up comments. We are having success with rebar on imports, on trade cases. We will continue to have success. It's a little bit of a whack a mole game. You've heard me use that term before. You need to try different countries. You try different companies. But I will say, as I've said several times before and I think we're actually seeing some of this coming to fruition as we talk about more holistic solutions like 232. My comment being that Washington is beginning to understand our elected officials, the administration, beginning to have a better understanding of the consequences of imports not only on our economy but on our national security. And as a result, we are seeing more and more support for trade cases and for more holistic solutions.","But particularly on the trade cases, we're seeing much greater success than we've had in the past, quicker turnarounds. There's been several things that have come to into effect in terms of enforcement that are now supporting the trade cases as they get successfully prosecuted.","So yes, I'm confident that we're getting the handle, getting our hands around imports. It's always going to be a battle, but I continue to see more and more success and with that, a better competitive situation on rebar, rebar fabrication and frankly, on all of our products.","Seth Rosenfeld","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America.","Timna Tanners","Hey, good afternoon, gentlemen.","John Ferriola","Hey Tim, how are you?","Timna Tanners","Hello. So I've just wanted to recycle, you guys are green, so let's recycle a question I asked earlier today. If we believe Section 232 results in any sort of reduction in imports, the domestic industry is running really hard on a flat-rolled overall. And assumingly with OCTG, if it gets hit as well, you need to produce that domestically. So assuming you would get pretty tight and you and Steel Dynamics are looking downstream, but not adding more sheet capacity. So I was just wondering, are you considering also adding any flat-rolled capacity? Is there any flex in your system? Or are you more focused on galvanizing? And if so, are we not worried about given auto weakening any excess galvanized in the market?","John Ferriola","Okay. A bunch of questions there. Okay, wondering let me see if I can handle them one at a time. I'll start with a question about if we get a good ruling on 232, we have concerns about being able to meet the needs in the marketplace and my first answer to that is absolutely not. You asked if we have any flex. I believe, what you meant by that was the ability to produce more steel in our existing facilities. Nucor is also doing that. We've been doing that forever. We will continue to do that. We will find ways to get product out that we need to meet our customers\u2019 demand. As I made the comment in Washington a couple of weeks ago when I was asked a similar question, I said bring it on. Give us a chance. Let us show you what we can do. We will take care of that.","Now for the longer term answer to that though on the 232, what \u2013 why we're pushing so hard forward 232 and what holistic solution, is that it provides an environment of sustainability so that we can continue to invest for the future. You have to create an environment where you get the right returns for the investments where you know that you have certain operating utilization rates based upon being able to have a reasonable limit on the market penetration of imports. Once that's accomplished, there's no doubt in my mind that Nucor will continue to invest. Let's look at it this way. We invested $7 billion without having that, okay.","What do you think we would do if we had a sustainable environment, that we'd be confident on getting the returns? There's no doubt in my mind and there's no limit to looking over at Mr. Frias and I\u2019m absolutely confident that there's no limit to our buildup \u2013 there's always a limit but it that a pretty high limit our ability to raise the capital that we would need to able to make significant investments, to meet the future needs of our customers and that's in, of course, all of our products. Rebar, merchants, plane, sheets to my you name it, HSS. As I've said in Washington, give us \u2013 give our industry the opportunity to show you what we can do by providing a sustainable environment in which the industry can operate in, and I am confident we will meet the needs both militarily, and commercially and economically. Now is there another question in this? So I've think there's the galvanized.","Timna Tanners","Yes, I didn\u2019t in light in auto weakening, and so on. Yes.","John Ferriola","Well, auto weakening is taking place. There's no doubt that it's plateaued. I'm hearing numbers around 7.1 units versus 7.5 units, okay. There's no doubt in my mind that there's some weakening going to be occurring. It's only to the effect. I would tell you this, at the end of the day, our part \u2013 our market share of automotive continues to grow. So when you look at how we've gone over the last several years and how we anticipate growing over the next couple of years, we'll be getting a bigger piece of a smaller pie. So in terms of our growth in automotive, we're confident we can continue to grow in automotive.","And in terms of more general comments on the galvanizing line, if you look at Nucor, we tend to be underweighted and galvanized. Where the galvanized represents about 18% of our product today, of our sheet products today, most of our competitors have numbers closer to 30% to 35%. If you look at our existing coating lines, Timna, we've been running at full capacity, full utilization since 2014 on our galvanizing lines. So it only makes sense for us to continue to grow that business. I'd also point out that the galvanized consumption in the U.S. is growing. It's expected to grow pretty significantly between now and 2020.","And as that \u2013 as a further comment, the two lines that we are building, I've touched upon this early but I'll reiterate. The two lines that we're building are not traditional lines. Our line at Gallatin is ultra-wide. It's going to be a wide, heavy gauge. Goes up to 0.25 inch. Our current capacity, I think, is 0.125, maybe. So it's about twice what of we can currently produce. It's going to be located in the Midwest, which is the largest galvanized consuming region in the country. So we're confident that there will be room for us there because it is more of a niche. It's not just another galv line. And the same is true in our mill \u2013 galvanizing facility we\u2019re building in Mexico. It's not just another coating line. It's a very specialized, automotive-grade, very high spec galvanizing line that we feel will meet the needs of advanced deals that are coming down the road.","Point out one more thing quickly, and that is the location of it in Mexico is perfect. We're surrounded by automotive companies that have been relocating there. We've got a great Japanese partner that will help us get into some other companies that we haven't been able to get into yet. ","Timna Tanners","Okay. If I can, I'll ask a easy follow-up, or have I ask all of them, sir?","John Ferriola","So far you've been asking them, so go ahead.","Timna Tanners","One easy follow-up, I promise. Just if you could update us on where you think we are in the construction cycle. I know in the past you\u2019ve mentioned that this time around, you expect it to cap out lower than last environment what we experienced. Just want to get your latest thoughts on the cycle, please.","John Ferriola","Well, if we use 2007 as kind of the peak market, I would say we're somewhere around 65% of where we were back in 2007. So it's getting better. It's continuing to improve. But it's \u2013 as I've said in the past, it's a slow rate of improvement. When I look at this particular year, it's kind of \u2013 I think it's going to be an interesting year. So I recently projected a growth of about 4%, 5% over the course of the year. If you look at the first half of this year, you had to have some negative growth somewhere in the neighboring of about 3% to 4% negative. So for that to come out and hit 5% I think is probably unrealistic. I would put the number today, maybe closer to overall flat for the year or up 1%, 2017 over 2016.","But even with that small differential, what that does bode well for us as a second half of the year in construction. When we look at \u2013 and that's supported by some things we do see. The guards have this thing they call the momentum indicator. That's positive. The ABI is positive. We always look to our downstream businesses, to our auto entry rate to get an indicator of construction markets going forward and that's also a positive. When we look in particular areas, we see one area of nonresidential construction that has been somewhat positive, has been infrastructure, particularly on the bridges. For us that's good news for our structural business and particularly, with some investments we made recently with wide [ph] piling and the QST.","So \u2013 and we are still hoping for some news on our infrastructure build, which would prolong the cycle. And I've spoken a lot about the nonresidential construction, but I will point out that residential constructions having a good year. That's up about 4%, or 5%. And while it doesn't have the same impact on steel consumption, you do have some impact in terms of white goods, appliances and some of those other kinds of things.","So overall, second half of 2017, I think, will be better and the first half on construction, at the end of the day, we'll be up maybe 1% year-over-year.","Timna Tanners","Okay, great. Thanks for your update. I appreciate it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Let\u2019s move to Dave Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead sir. ","Dave Gagliano","Thanks for taking my questions. I just had a couple of short term specific questions. Just on the things were a little different than what we're expecting side of it. Pricing in sheet had bounced up quite a bit in the quarter. I was wondering if you could to explain a little bit more as to what happened there. And also, historically, plate volumes, which have been very strong the last two quarters. Historically, when we have strong plate volumes a couple of quarters, the next quarter's a big drop off. I just want to make sure there's no reason to expect a similar drop off in the third quarter.","John Ferriola","I'm going to address the sheet question, and I'm going to ask you to repeat the second question. I didn\u2019t quite hear the word you're asking about. So first of all, let's talk about sheet pricing. For us, it's a couple of things. Number one, some portion of it can be attributed to mix. Also, as I've said a couple of times on the call and in the past, we continue to move up the value chain our sheet products. So that has helped us on our pricing. In terms of the general increases that we've seen, we have a $30 increase a couple of weeks ago. That's been well-supported by the marketplace. We're collecting that well.","And the most recent $25 one [indiscernible] went out last night, as we've said in the past, we don't go out with price increases unless that we are very confident that we're able to collect some of the things that we look at. We look at the demand, which as I said, continues to look strong. We look at service center inventories, which continue to be very low.","One of the other things that\u2019s helped us at Nucor with our pricing, frankly, on our Flat-Rolled Product is the addition of our new business in HSS. A lot of our spot \u2013 what was spot funds are now going downstream into our own businesses. So that gives us a little bit more flexibility. It evens out our mix a little bit better between hot band and cold because we \u2013 hot band is not going out to the marketplace. So I've given you several reasons and hopefully, that answers your question.","Could you repeat the second part of the question because I couldn\u2019t catch that one word?","David Francis","Sure that\u2019s helpful by the way. I was asking about your plate volumes, which have been obviously very strong the last two quarters and I just wanted to make sure there's no reason to expect those to come down at all in the quarter.","John Ferriola","I apologize. I was putting those two words together and I couldn't figure out what the word was okay. Plate volumes continue to be strong. There's several reasons we can give for that. First one that I will point out is our Hertford County plate, plate mill with its heat treating; new on the plate that we're able to produce there with some military applications. That's been good for us. Our new addition mill in Longview, Texas. Although that's still coming online, it's \u2013 we've been able to introduce a lot of new grades there. That's helped us there. And we've had a positive outcome on the trade case.","So there's a \u2013 again, I mentioned earlier, bridges. That's obviously \u2013 a lot of plate goes in the bridges. So that's been good for us. I got to tell you then, this is a shout out to our teams on the plate side. They've done a great job not only on new grades that have been developed, but new applications that they're going into, new customers and frankly, the team down in Longview. Tell you what, guys, you're doing a good job. Please keep it up. Just keep doing it safely, okay?","So no, I don't expect to see any significant change in our plate volumes. And again, if we get the kind of results we're hoping out of Washington, not only would I not expect to see a decrease, I would absolutely expect to see an increase in volumes and other aspects of our plate business.","David Francis","Okay, Thank you ","Operator","And your next question comes from Philip Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Philip Gibbs","Thank you. Good afternoon.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon Philip.","Philip Gibbs","I had a question, John, on the bar shipments in the quarter. I think almost 1.5 million tons, the best from a quarterly perspective we've seen, I think, in three years or more. Just curious in terms of what drove that relative to the last several quarters? Is it efforts to regain market share? Has it a picked up in SBQ, rebar? Don't want to be too leading here, but just want to understand here the strength in the quarter.","John Ferriola","I'd be happy to answer it. Fully stable on rebar and merchant bar. That's been pretty stable. We really are focused on our SQB business, excuse me, okay, and particularly out of our Memphis facility and our Norfork facility in terms of new grades. In Memphis, we've added the heat treating, which has really helped our business. Our cold finished business is getting better all the time, and that's another downstream outlet for our SBQ. So our billet business, another of our SBQ billet business has been strong the last couple of quarters. So what's really grown, driven the change over the last couple of quarters has been our SBQ business. And of course, that means also our cold finished business beyond that. So that's what really drove \u2013 to what drove the business.","One of the things you can't have more volume coming out of SBQ if you're not getting more approvals and qualifications from automotive customers our heavy equipment customers, specialty customers. And as such, adding all of our products as we continue to drive up the value chain become higher-value, more specialized. We're able to pick up not only more volume, but better pricing that goes along with it. So hats off to the team at SBQ and cold finished. Thanks for the job you're doing. Keep it going.","Philip Gibbs","I appreciate that, second question here. For the third quarter, are you anticipating your volumes will be pretty similar to where they've been in the second quarter? Or should we expect some seasonality? And then adjunct is, on the corporate and eliminations, I know we heard some of the explanation earlier, but should we expect that to taper down a bit versus the second quarter?","John Ferriola","I'll tackle the first part then throw it over to Jim, okay. In terms of our volumes, I would say that we certainly see a stability going forward with a fairly positive view that they'll go up if we see smoke. Positive view coming out of Washington will have an impact on our volumes, and it will be a positive impact, without a doubt. So without anything coming out of Washington, pretty stable going forward, maybe a slight uptick. But with any help coming out of Washington, which we do expect. President Trump has made some commitments to us, and we expect him to stand behind those commitments. We're certainly working to make that happen. If it does, we could see some volume improvements as well as other parts of our business. Jim?","Jim Frias","So Phil, if you may recall in my comments as part of our script last quarter, I said that I expected intercompany eliminations to be lower in the second quarter, and I was wrong. So I'll caveat my statement with that week. We had about $32 million of the total in Q1 profitable or \u2013 corporate eliminations was profiting \u2013 Intercompany profit related. The second quarter's about to be $7 million. I think it's going to be down in the third quarter compared to what it was in the second, maybe closer to the first quarter. But it depends on how much inventory we have and depends on high margins we have. If intercompany inventories get higher and if margins get higher, then we could have a bigger expense. If inventories stay flat and margins stay flat, it will be close to zero.","Philip Gibbs","Okay, that's really helpful. And should we anticipate that DRI can see another leg of upside here in the third quarter as you may begin either little bit into some lower cost inventory and have a full complement of assets up and running? Thanks","John Ferriola","You mean relative to intercompany eliminations, is that your question.","Philip Gibbs","No, just relative to itself and the [indiscernible].","Jim Frias","Okay I\u2019ll answer that. There are plans in Louisiana and in Trinidad have been running very, very well, running full volume, high quality, great yields, good products and we fully expect them to run that way throughout the third quarter the rest of the year, 2018, 2019,2020 and beyond.","Philip Gibbs","Thank you.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. John Ferriola for any additional or closing remarks.","John Ferriola","Let me just conclude by saying thank you to our shareholders. We really appreciate your confidence and your support. As always, thank you to our customers. We appreciate your business. Without you, we're not around. So thank you for your business.","I want to say a special thank you to my Nucor teammates for creating value for our customers, generating attractive returns for our shareholders and building a sustainable future for all of us.

Thank you, all.","While steel markets remain challenging, we have a number of exciting updates to share with you today on our success in growing Nucor's long-term earnings power. Nucor is in a position of strength in our industry, and we are growing strongly. We are primed and ready for the inevitable steel industry's cyclical upturn.","I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to discuss our second quarter results and financial position. Following Jim, I will discuss the execution on many of our initiatives focused on profitable growth. Jim?","James D. Frias","Thanks, John, and good afternoon. Second quarter of 2013 earnings of $0.27 per diluted share were within our guidance range of between $0.25 to $0.30 per diluted share. Consistent with our guidance, there was no LIFO impact on the results for the just completed quarter. By comparison, first quarter of 2013 results included an after-tax LIFO charge of $0.03 per diluted share.","On a sequential quarter basis, our steel mills' profitability declined. Our fabricated products business returned profitability in the second quarter, following a modest loss in the seasonally slow first quarter. Fabricated products, which included joist and decking, rebar fabrication and pre-engineered metal buildings have now reported profits for 4 of the past 5 quarters. This improved performance has been achieved during very depressed levels of nonresidential construction.","A quick comment about our tax rate since it can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting out profits belonging to our business partners, the second quarter of 2013 effective tax rate was 35.1%, or slightly higher than normal.","Balance sheet strength remains an important attribute of Nucor's business model. Our total debt-to-capital ratio is 31%. Cash, short-term investments and restricted cash totaled $749 million at the end of the second quarter of 2013. Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn, and it does not mature until December 2016. We have no commercial paper outstanding.","Nucor is the only steel producer in North America to enjoy the extremely important competitive advantage of an investment grade credit rating. Standard & Poor's highlighted our unrivaled position of financial strength in the steel industry in the second quarter of 2013 review of U.S. metals and mining companies' strongest to weakest. Nucor was again ranked #1 for credit rating and business risk profile among the universe of 66 companies.","Nucor's second quarter cash position decreased by $330 million from the immediately preceding quarter. Decline was largely due to the retirement of $250 million of long-term debt maturing in June, as well as of the ongoing funding of our 2013 capital projects. In an uncertain economy, we are well positioned to benefit from the financial flexibility provided by our strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow generation through the cycle.","Our balance sheet liquidity and cash flow have enabled us to continue Nucor's long tradition of growing stronger during downturns. 2013 capital expenditures are expected to exceed $1.1 billion. Of this total, we estimate that more than 80% is for what we consider to be strategic investments. The balance is for more recurring or maintenance capital spending. Our strategic investments are viewed as relatively low-risk and high-return projects focused on key objectives, such as lowering our raw material cost and shifting our product mix to include more value-added offerings.","Lowering our raw materials cost improves our competitive position and profitability throughout the economic cycle. The shift in our portfolio to more value-added, higher margin products does the same, as well as reducing the competitive pressure we face from imports.","The most significance of these investments, which are being completed over the balance of 2013 and into 2014 include: adding a normalizing line at our North Carolina plate mill; constructing our Louisiana direct-reduced iron facility and the related natural gas drilling investments; expanding our South Carolina flat-rolled mills product portfolio to include wider and lighter gauge sheet steel; expanding our north -- excuse me, expanding our Nucor-Yamato structural mills portfolio of sheet piling products to build upon our highly successful 2012 acquisition of Skyline Steel, the market leader in steel piling distribution; and expanding our value-added SBQ production capabilities at our bar mills in South Carolina, Nebraska and Tennessee.","As the majority of our strategic projects will be completed by early to mid-2014, we expect lower capital expenditures next year. Total spending at our steelmaking, raw materials and downstream businesses should decline closer to more maintenance-type levels. At the same time, our natural gas drilling expenditures will be at contractual levels, which we have previously disclosed, totaling over $700 million for the 2-year period of 2014 and 2015.","Nucor's natural gas investments will secure a long-term, low-cost supply of natural gas, sufficient to cover our expected future steelmaking and DRI production needs for more than 20 years. The performance of wells completed over the past 2 years has exceeded the projections we used to justify this capital allocation decision. That, of course, translates into lower gas cost and high returns from our drilling investments.","We also expect our natural gas investments to be cash flow positive by 2016, meaning the cash generated from sales will exceed the cost of drilling new wells.","Our team is excited by the opportunities we are executing to continue rewarding Nucor shareholders with very attractive long-term returns under valuable capital. The objective of our growth strategy is higher highs and peak earnings power and shareholder value through successive business cycles.","For the third quarter of 2013, Nucor's earnings are expected to improve modestly from the second quarter level. This outlook reflects several factors. Lateral pricing has improved in the recent weeks due to market supply disruptions resulting from production and labor issues in several competitors. Our downstream businesses expect further improvement in earnings in the seasonally strong third quarter. We also expect our David J. Joseph scrap processing operations to benefit from the recent increase in scrap pricing. On the negative side, we expect pre-operating, start costs at our Louisiana due to actually increase in the third quarter.","Overall, the outlook continues to be challenged by economic -- excuse me, overall, the outlook continues to be challenged by anemic economic growth and excess global steel capacity. Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance in the final month of the quarter. John?","John J. Ferriola","Thanks, Jim. As I mentioned earlier, we are now 5 years into what remains a stagnant global economic environment, and in turn, extremely difficult steel market conditions. Two facts tell the story of this harsh environment.","First, in this so-called U.S. economic recovery that began in June of 2009, a realistic measure of the unemployment rate has seen very little progress over 4 years and currently stands at 17.5%. That rate includes the unemployed, underemployed, and those people who have simply given up hope to finding a job and have dropped out of the labor force.","Second, imports continue to devastate the margins and output of the steel industry in the United States. Through May of this year, steel imports are running at an annualized rate of nearly 26 million tons. This makes no sense at all, given the fact that American producers are among the lowest-cost producers of steel in the world. The reason it is happening is the failure of U.S. trade policy to address imported steel sold at dumped and subsidized prices in a timely and effective manner.","The recent pipe and tube trade case filed against Korea and 8 other countries is yet another example of our country's \"too little, too late\" approach to enforcing trade laws. Our view remains unchanged. These very serious challenges facing the U.S. economy all have solutions. The time is right and long overdue to reinvigorate the American economy by seizing very real and significant opportunities available to our nation in energy, infrastructure rebuilding and growing a globally competitive U.S. manufacturing sector that can only prosper in a environment of rules-based free trade.","Why is it so important that we have effective and timely enforcement of rules-based free trade? If not for dumped steel and subsidized imports, we would have more production and more jobs in the United States. Put simply, the key ingredients required for healthy and sustainable U.S. economic growth are jobs, jobs and more jobs.","For the steel industry, it is absolutely critical that policymakers address the issue of China's estimated excess of steel production capacity of at least 200 million tons. Most, if not virtually all of this capacity, is government-owned and subsidized. The bottom line is simple. The Chinese government must reduce government-owned capacity, not build more of it. The Chinese government must also stop providing financing and other subsidies to steel producers that are not cost effective and do not earn adequate returns to be sustained.","You can expect Nucor to continue to be proactive and stake out a sound economic policy. It is vital to fulfilling our most important responsibility to be good stewards of our shareholders' valuable capital. The Nucor team has always managed our business with a long-term perspective. With that longer-term view, we are bullish on the profitable growth opportunities for both the American economy and for Nucor. We are optimistic regarding the desire and ability of the American people to do the right things over the long run to reinvigorate our economy.","Quite frankly, the time is right for a U.S. economic renaissance fueled by our country's abundant energy resources and a workforce unrivaled in its productivity and ability to innovate. For those reasons, we are busy building a stronger Nucor. To that end, we have invested approximately $8 billion of our shareholders' capital from the last cyclical peak in the economy in 2008 through the end of 2013.","As Jim discussed, our most recent period of investment to grow long-term earnings will peak this year. These investments have dramatically expanded Nucor's long-term earnings power. I would also like to reiterate Jim's point that our investments during this downturn are what we consider low risk and high return. Rather than just adding capacity to an oversupplied market, Nucor is reducing its raw materials cost and shifting our mix toward more value-added, higher-margin products.","Over the next several years, our unrelenting focus will remain on executing our strategic plan and converting our $8 billion of investments into higher highs and profitability once the next cyclical upturn inevitably arrives. At the same time, we will continue to plan for tomorrow, while executing today.","I will now update you on the excellent progress achieved by our team this quarter in executing our strategic growth. Construction is nearing completion on our 2.5 million metric ton annual capacity DRI facility in Louisiana. We expect to begin hot commissioning in August and to start production by the end of September.","Our team in Louisiana is doing an excellent job bringing online a plan of enormous scope. For example, the material handling equipment includes 4.5 miles of conveyors. A port facility has one mile of Mississippi River frontage and is capable of receiving vessels as large as 950 feet in length, with cargoes of about 115,000 metric tons. Given the scope of this project, start-up tick ups are to be expected. However, our confidence is extremely high in the process technology.","We expect completion of our Louisiana plant, paired with our long-term and low-cost natural gas supply, will be a game changer for Nucor's core structure for high-quality iron units. Nucor is preparing to take a huge step forward in the implementation of our raw materials strategy. Combining Louisiana's capacity with the 2 million tons of annual capacity of our existing Trinidad DRI plant will bring us to our 2\/3 of our long-term goal to control 6 million to 7 million tons of annual capacity in high-quality scrap substitutes.","In June, our Hertford County, North Carolina plate mill successfully started production on its new normalizing line. The initial output has been well received by our customers, who have noted superior flatness and surface quality of our normalized plate. Our 120,000 tons per year capacity normalizing line will serve attractive end-use markets, such as energy, transportation, shipbuilding and on the plate.","Complementing our recent investments in the heat treat facility and a vacuum tank degasser, Herbert County's value-added plate product's annual capacity has now doubled to 240,000 tons. Our bar mill group is on track with the implementation of several projects to expand our SBQ production capabilities at our mills in South Carolina, Nebraska and Tennessee. In the current quarter, the South Carolina mill will start production on its new bar locker. This equipment will allow us to expand our participation in an attractive and underserved bar mill [ph] market in the Southeastern United States.","In the second half of this year, our Tennessee mill will commission new state-of-the-art SBQ bar inspection equipment that will provide growth opportunities in supplying precision, engineered bars for the most demanding applications.","In late 2013, our Nebraska mill will bring online significant upgrades that include a bar share [ph] straightener and cold shear. Other Nucor SBQ projects are scheduled for completion in 2014. It is important to understand that all of our SBQ investments had one objective: It is to expand the breadth and depth of Nucor's value-added SBQ product offerings. We see many attractive opportunities to better serve existing and new customers with our growing SBQ product portfolio.","Our team at Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill remains on time and on budget for the first quarter of 2014 completion of its wide range project. This investment involves an upgrade in the modernization of equipment from the top of the caster through the reversing mills. It will provide Berkeley with the capability to produce wider and lighter gauge sheet steel. These expanded capabilities will provide profitable opportunities to move up the value chain in agricultural, [indiscernible] industrial equipment, heavy truck and automotive high-strength and ultra high-strength applications.","Our Nucor-Yamato sheet piling product expansion is on schedule for production startup in the second half of 2014. This project will add several new sheet piling sections to their value-added offerings. This initiative is an excellent example of Nucor's time-proven, highest-return strategy for profitable growth investments that optimize our existing operations. In this case, we are expanding the opportunities for profitable growth, both in the production of sheet piling at Nucor-Yamato and in distribution by recently acquired Skyline Steel.","While market conditions remain frustratingly challenged, these are nevertheless exciting times for the Nucor family as we grow stronger and stronger. A stronger Nucor is one that continually improves its capability to take care of our customers. As always, we define our customers as being the people who buy and use our products, our teammates and our shareholders.","In closing, I want to, again, thank everyone on the Nucor team for working safely, working hard and working together to build a stronger Nucor. Thank you, and please keep it going. We would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Michelle Applebaum with Steel Market Intelligence.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","So there was great article in the American Metal Market last week. You gave some interviews, and there were some new things in the article. There was one thing in particular that really surprised me. You said that with -- and I apologize this isn't the great first question. But you were talking about kind of how you would -- how you guys would be running the company going forward. And you said one thing you'll see more emphasis is commercial side. And then you said, \"Without a doubt, we're known for our operational prowess. People say Nucor is one hell of an operating company, and we are. They might not say we are one hell of a commercial company, and we're going to change that.\" I got that's kind of unusual for even a new CEO to come out and say something like that. So I was going to kind of ask you to elaborate on what you meant by that, and where you thought the opportunities might be.","John J. Ferriola","Okay. It's a good question. I don't remember using those words in the article, but I'm sure I did. So let me start by making a few comments. Yes, we are focused on commercial excellence. That's an area of improvement that we believe will -- is important to Nucor. I also want to make sure I stressed the fact that we've got a great commercial team, they're doing a great job already. But at Nucor, continuous improvement is our middle name, so we're focused on getting even better in commercial excellence. And I'll talk some of the areas that we will focus on. But I also have to make sure that I stress the fact that we are operationally excellent, and there will be no focus taken off of remaining excellent in our operations. So looking to expand our commercial excellence going forward, this isn't really any change of direction for the company. It's more of an expansion of expectations for all of our teammates. Commercial excellence isn't something that's just done by our commercial team. It's something that's the responsibility of every member of the Nucor family. And as we focus on commercial excellence, we talk about 5 areas of focus. We call them the 5 pillars of commercial excellence. And just going through them briefly, it's being more market driven, it means being more aware, more -- better at anticipating the needs of our customers and finding ways to create value for them. It's being easier to do business with. It's building strong, durable loyal relationships that bring value to our customers and to us. And it's about creating sustainable results, making decisions that are long-term decisions to bring extra value to us and to our customers. And finally, it's about doing it together, leveraging the overwhelming competitive advantage, our 22,000 teammates working together bring to our customers and are, of course, expecting to get paid for that value.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","Okay. Well, one of the things I wanted to say that really impressed me about you saying that whether those were exactly the words. I know you don't say swear words, so probably not.","John J. Ferriola","It might have been a slip of the moment.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","Is that you've sort of been the Chief Commercial Officer. That sort of have been your mission at the company. So I just want to say -- I'm not going to opine whether what I think of your commercial efforts. But for you to say that about something that sort of been one of your main pillars last 10 years, I think, is quite impressive in and of itself. So I just wanted to say, kudos to you to kind of look for that in the public domain. My second question was an easier question. Why did your capacity utilization drop from 77% in the first half of last year to 72.5% in the first of this year?","John J. Ferriola","Well, there was couple of reasons, Michelle. One, that I'll start with is that we had taken fairly large shutdowns in the first half of this year in preparation for many of the projects that we mentioned just a while ago. Our Darlington facility was offline for, I think, 3 weeks in preparing for the projects that we're doing there. NYS was offline for 17 days, preparing for the piling project work that we're doing there. We had a Memphis outage preparing for the second vacuum tank gasser. So we had a lot of things going on. And in addition to that, we typically take an awful lot of our maintenance shutdowns in the second quarter. A lot of our facilities are located in areas where you have extreme heat in summer and extremely cold weather in the winter. So we try to moderate shutdown temperatures by working in the second quarter. So we had a lot of maintenance shutdowns also in the second quarter. I guess, one final point that I would mention is when I look back at the -- at 2012, if memory serves me -- correct me, the first half of 2012, we were very strong on Flat-Rolled Products. Our sheet business was very strong in the first half of 2012, and it's down in the first half of 2013. And part of that, obviously, is driven by the topic that I had early in the opening comments, and that being imports. We've -- we at the whole industry, operating capacity utilization is down as a result of the tremendous number of imports that have been flooding into the United States in the first half of this year.","Operator","And we'll go next to Martin Englert with Jefferies.","Martin Englert - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Looking to the release, you had noted this time around that construction market remain challenged. Last quarter, you kind of highlighted cautious optimism and slow improvement. Has your view changed at all?","John J. Ferriola","Well, cautious optimism is the only thing that keeps us going in this market. We'll say it again. There are certain things that we see that give us some slight indication that things might be getting a little bit better. We always look at residential construction as a leading indicator, a 9- to 12-month leading indicator of nonresidential construction. And we have noticed an improvement in residential construction. If past performance holds true, that might lead to an improvement in nonresidential construction in 9 or 12 months. We also take a look at our downstream businesses, and they tend to be leading indicators for nonresidential construction. We look at our backlogs, our order entry rates, and although they haven't been spiking to the level that we'd like to see them, we do see an improvement in those areas.","Martin Englert - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","When you start to look into the, I guess, backlogs and different type of work that's comprised of, is there anything that you're starting to see this cycle as far as the different types of nonresidential construction projects, if there's a greater focus, whether it be in manufacturing or energy versus infrastructure? Is there anything happening there this cycle relative to last that you see is different?","John J. Ferriola","Well, I'll just make a couple of general comments. We see industrial nonconstruction being challenged. It's -- frankly, it's down a little bit. On the other hand, we see some of the commercial on residential construction picking up.","Operator","We'll go next to Nate Carruthers with Steel Market Intelligence.","Nate Carruthers","So you were just talking about downstream a little bit. But I noticed that your rebar fab shipments are actually down 11% year-over-year in the first half. I guess, I was just wondering, what was driving that? And if you expect any kind of catch-up in the second half?","John J. Ferriola","Well, I'll make some general comments, and I'll ask Ray Napolitan to jump in if he has anything he'd like to add. As a general comment, the rebar fabrication and rebar markets in the states -- in the United States have been challenged. Our business in Canada continues to be very strong, and we continue to see that growing. But we -- again, rebar imports have been a challenge for the country. Rebar fabrication, along with nonresidential construction is typically lower. Anything that you want to add, Ray?","Raymond S. Napolitan","Well, this is Ray Napolitan. One thing I would add is weather has influenced us in the last -- in the first part of the year here. And shipments have been behind, but we're gradually seeing projects break lose and return to schedule. So weather's probably been the biggest impact of our rebar fabrication.","Nate Carruthers","Okay. So do you expect, I guess, that to pick up a bit then in the second half?","John J. Ferriola","I think in Jim's notes, he mentioned that we expect to see our downstream businesses perform a little bit better in the third quarter.","Operator","The next is Curtis Woodworth with Nomura.","Curtis Rogers Woodworth - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","John, you talked a little bit about even going to lower more maintenance CapEx levels in the future and then harvesting a lot of the investments that you've made over the past couple of years. And it seems like you still have the ability from a liquidity perspective to pursue additional investments. I know that the additional DRI facility is on the table. But can you talk a little bit about the M&A strategy? And if we're in a environment, where the steel consumption growth rates continue to be low, would you look at using more capital to grow the M&A?","John J. Ferriola","Let me start by making a comment on the maintenance CapEx. We did not say that we will lower our maintenance CapEx. We will keep the maintenance CapEx at the levels that we've always had at that. We will not in, anyway, sacrifice the condition of our equipment going forward. So we will continue to invest in the maintenance that we need to keep our mills in top-notch condition to produce high-quality product to be able to deliver it to our customers on time, so that's number one. Secondly, I did comment in my statement that we will continue to plan for the future while we execute today. And what I meant by that was that we will continue to be opportunistic in our M&A activities. If we see a great opportunity coming down the pipe, we're going to jump at it. A great example of that would be Skyline just last year. And we weren't anticipating that coming along. We didn't really plan for it, to be honest with you. But when the opportunity presented itself, we went after it, and successfully. And it's been a great addition to the Nucor family. We're really happy and proud to have them as part of the Nucor family. So we'll continue to look at opportunities. We'll continue to be opportunistic as we approach them. The point that I do want to stress though is we are focusing on execution. We've invested $8 billion growing our company. That's a lot of money. Our shareholders rightfully so have the expectation that we will convert that investment on their part into higher highs during the inevitable up cycle that we know is coming. So we are going to continue to look at M&A. There's really no difference in our strategy except perhaps we'll be a little bit more opportunistic as we look at those things that come across and become available. But we are going to focus our attention heavily on executing on the investments that we've already made.","Operator","We'll go next to Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I really appreciated some of the detail that you gave on a lot of the different projects. Maybe this isn't the venue, but it'll be helpful to try to get a little more color on not just the timing but volumes or potential margin contribution. I don't know if that's something that you could offer at a later point or if you have some color that you can provide on some of the projects now.","John J. Ferriola","Well, we've given some detail on the volume, so we are not going to be giving anything out on the margin improvements. That's information that I'm sure some of our competitors who are probably listening to this call would love to hear. We're not going to accommodate them. But we've talked about the SBQ, value-added volumes, in -- we talked roughly in terms of 1 million tons of additional -- and we want to stress this. It's very important to stress, this isn't just additional capacity in the SBQ business. There's a plenty of capacity out there, and there's plenty more capacity coming online. Our focus is twofold, focusing on adding to our value-added portfolio and on improving the effectiveness and efficiencies of our existing bar mills by shifting by product shift, by mixing, by changing on mix at those facilities.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then when you talked about maintenance CapEx or returning to a more maintenance CapEx-like level, with the addition of your natural gas investments, how does that factor in future DRI investments? Or are you still kind of waiting to decide on a second and further DRI investment?","John J. Ferriola","When I talk about maintenance CapEx, I'm speaking of, specifically, of maintenance work. In terms of future growth of the company, we will continue to look very seriously at a second DRI facility at the appropriate time. Right now, our focus is on getting #1 up and running in Louisiana. I have to clarify that, because we refer to it is our #2 DRI facility, counting the one in Trinidad. But all of our focus today is on getting through the cold commissioning, the hot commissioning and the startup of a new facility in Louisiana. When we get that up and running, we will take a look at a second DRI facility.","Operator","We'll go next to Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a -- hey, I read an article that, John, you were in D.C. on Tuesday, meeting with congressional folks and some folks in commerce. Just -- what are the -- if you could share some of, I guess, one, who you met with, and what was discussed if -- anything you can comment on that going forward on the trade front?","John J. Ferriola","Well, we will met with a few senators. We were given the opportunity to spend some time with Senator Sessions. And we also spent time with Ambassador Froman and Undersecretary Sanchez. And also, later in the afternoon, we had the opportunity to meet with Senator Brown. And I'm not going to go into specific details of the conversation. We presented our case very clearly. And I will make the following comment. We got a great reception by all of the parties involved. And I'll make the -- I'll take this opportunity to publicly thank them for their time and for listening to our arguments. Certainly, none could make any firm commitments, but I will tell you that having made several trips to Washington now, my sense is that we are getting -- the message is being better understood and better received each time we go and we speak to the appropriate people. The message is getting across about the impact that imports are having on our industry. And we stress each time we go that we are not asking for protection, we're not asking for subsidies, we're not asking for the government to invest in our companies. We're asking nothing more than a level playing field on which our teams can compete, because we absolutely believe that given a level playing field, our team here at Nucor will compete successfully against anyone, anywhere in the world. So that's a little bit of the color of what we talked about that day. I hope -- and we will continue to work hard to make sure that we continue to gain ground in this arena. It's extremely important to us. The current trade laws simply are not getting the job done. They are reactive. They are not proactive, and we need a more proactive approach to trade laws. The concept of waiting until serious injury occurs to the industry just simply doesn't make sense, and we need to become more productive. We certainly have the data to do it. We have information that we gather on the import licensing. So we know when the tsunami is heading our way. We know where it's coming from. We know when it's going to hit. And it's ridiculous that we don't use that information to take a more proactive approach to dealing with the tsunami that we know is coming. It's important to our industry, and it's important to our teammates here at Nucor. And frankly, it's important to the American worker.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Going back to the existing system, I guess. We saw OCTG case brought forward earlier this month. Are there any other products in particular that are in the works right now, where we might see something similar?","John J. Ferriola","Well, this is why I would say all of the above, okay? We are looking carefully at every product that's being imported. We believe that there are many that fall into the same category that are being brought in illegally. They're bringing dumped. They're coming -- they're being subsidized. And we're gathering data now, and we'll take action in a very -- in a variety of products that we focus on.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And maybe just one modeling question on DRI. You mentioned that there could be some costs associated with the startup in the next quarter. How should we think about that as we go out the next kind of 12, 18 months as per modeling that you ramp and DRI, as far as getting a breakeven and moving to profitability and so forth?","James D. Frias","This is Jim Frias. First of all, it's a pre-operating start-up cost. The total was roughly $6 million in the second quarter, and most of that was related to DRI. And the final weeks and months of starting up a facility has the most difficult amount of startup cost to predict. I think they could roughly double. And they might be a little higher and a little lower, but that's the range we they can roughly double. And in terms of reaching a breakeven at startup, it probably depends on how quickly it ramps -- it totally depends on how quickly it ramps up. The first DRI facility that we started up in Trinidad was profitable, I think, in the second or third month of operations. So it ought to be pretty quickly reaching a breakeven profit point in our view, if the start doesn't have glitches. But as John noted in his comments, a lot can happen in a startup. You can find it -- an equipment problem that you didn't know existed until you start running the equipment.","John J. Ferriola","We certainly expect to see some hiccups as we get started. But we are very confident in our ability to deal with those hiccups. This isn't our first rodeo when it comes to startups. And we started up very complex facilities in the past. We've experienced the hiccups that come along with it. And at every case, we've overcome them and with that a successful operation. Facility in Louisiana will be no different.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Galison with CIBC.","David Galison - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","So just -- was I correct in understanding that Q3 start-up cost will be around $12 million? Is that what you're thinking?","James D. Frias","That's a crude estimate, but yes.","David Galison - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","So then would it be fair to assume that the Q3 guidance that was provided for improvements in flat rolled, downstream and scrap pricing would be more than modest, I guess, and then offset by start-up costs?","James D. Frias","We did not get that specific in our guidance, in our thinking. We think that the operational side -- my guess, is if I had to guess, the pre-operating cost won't completely offset the improvement.","David Galison - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And we're still looking for -- reaching full production in 3 to 4 months?","John J. Ferriola","Well, what we've said in the past is that we expect to be at full production by the end of the year, and we still feel confident that, that can be achieved.","David Galison - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","And then as you're just -- I guess, maybe to help us understand. As your ramping the facility up, will it have an impact on your steel production as you're, I guess, using this material? Do you have to -- there's some dial up you have to do in order to incorporate this material? How should we think about that?","James D. Frias","We've been using DRI at a number of our steel mills for several years now. So there's really no effect in the steel operations to speak of. It's really going to be all about how quickly we can make the DRI and get it transported and delivered to our facilities.","Operator","We'll go next to Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you give us some sense of the timing of the Encana venture ramp, and when you may expect to be fully hedged in your natural gas needs for both DRI and steel?","James D. Frias","Well, that's a great question, and we haven't really disclosed that at this point. And I would just say that it really depends on a number of factors. One, if we continue having the success in volumes coming from each well we drill is one factor. So as we noted in our comments, we've been performing better than we modeled, when we first made the investment. Another factor is the timing of when we build our next DRI facility. And we haven't made a commitment to when we're going to do that yet. So I would just say that we could be balanced within probably 3 to 4 years is the range to think of, and that would cover steelmaking and DRI.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just the first phase of the DRI, when you say you're balanced within a 3- to 4-year time from?","James D. Frias","Yes.","John J. Ferriola","But I do want to stress, Jim, that as we look out forward, and again, without giving the details of the volumes involved, and we've said in the past, that we will reach a point where we will have enough gas to supply, not only all of our steel mill operations but also 2 DRI facilities. Alternatively, we would have enough gas to supply 3 DRI facilities.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. I just had one follow-up if I could, for you, John. Can you just talk a little bit about the evolution of your automotive business, and where you feel like you even gained some traction maybe relative to last year?","John J. Ferriola","Certainly. We continue to grow in automotive, not only in our flat-rolled business. During the -- during my comments, I spoke of the ultra-high strength steels that we are now supplying, going primarily into the automotive market. But we've also had a tremendous amount of success with our SBQ product in automotive. And again, you'll hear us talk often about the benefits of one Nucor and our ability to offer our customers a breadth of products under one umbrella. And automotive is a great example of that. We've piggybacked both sheet and SBQ off each other many times to gain entry into a new customer and allowed us to grow quicker than we anticipated in automotive. We have -- obviously, automotive is growing strongly in the Southeast. We have a strong presence in the Southeast. Automotive is growing rapidly in Mexico. We have a strong presence through our steel tech operations in Mexico to be able to serve that market. So we feel really good about where we are in automotive. And we're happy about that, because right now, automotive is one of the few bright spots in the marketplace.","Operator","We'll go next to Aldo Mazzaferro with Macquarie.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","I've got a couple of questions. First one on the CapEx forecast. I thought I heard you say that maintenance CapEx was about 20% of the $1.1 billion that you're projecting this year. Does that imply your CapEx next year is going to fall as low as below depreciation or anything like that?","James D. Frias","The CapEx at the steel mills could be or -- excuse me, the operations could be below the CapEx, or below depreciation. That could be the case, yes. But keep in mind that depreciation tends to be a bit front-weighted in the steel industry, so we've been making a lot of investments recently. So our depreciation number is ramped up pretty high.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","Yes. And so in terms of your debt on your balance sheet, it's very low cost debt, you wouldn't really have an intention to repay that I would think, right?","James D. Frias","We don't talk about our intentions relative to capital structure. That's publicly traded instruments as well.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, John, one question. I know you might not want to discuss it too much, but could you outline a little bit about your -- about the pros and cons you see in the Tyson [ph] plant, possibly from Nucor's point of view, whether you'd consider owning that plant, or that's just out of the question?","John J. Ferriola","I have to say you're very astute. It's something I do not want to discuss. And I'm not planning on discussing. We -- it's a process that's ongoing, and it's just not appropriate for me to comment at this time.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Yu with Citi.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I got a follow-up question on the natural gas. And Jim, you said it was -- performed better. In the past, I believe the all-in cost number was somewhere around $4 per MMBtu. And given what you've seen so far, can you help us with order of magnitude and how does that change that $4 number so far?","James D. Frias","Brian, we've never said a number, so I'm not sure where $4 came from. You may have backed into it, triangulated from things that we've shared. We perhaps said a number, but I think the important thing to think about is the fact that we do have some flexibility of the contract. And, John, do you want to speak to that, or would you prefer I...","John J. Ferriola","Well, either way, I'll make some comments. And we do have a great deal of flexibility in the contract. So we have some flexibility in the volume and in our drilling. We do have a threshold level, which if the price of gas drops under that threshold point -- price, we are not obligated to continue to drill. And that's a -- that's a level -- it's a level in which we feel very comfortable in being able to get a return even at that threshold level. So over the course of the drilling program, we feel very good about the returns that we're going to getting in this investment and the variability and flexibility we have on drilling. Anything else that you want to add?","James D. Frias","Just that we do have also flexibility to drill more wells that we're not committed to if, in fact, gas prices are higher, so we get an upside benefit too. On the downside, we can stop drilling if prices fall low on the upside. We can drill more at our option in certain areas.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Second one is with the DRI facility, there's more domestic iron ore miners, who are talking about making DR-grade pellets. I was wondering, if you guys have experimented with them? Any of the production has come out thus far? And then is it more cost advantageous to try to source it domestically than maybe from the international suppliers?","John J. Ferriola","You mean the iron ore specific or...","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, the DR-grade iron ore pellets.","John J. Ferriola","Well, we have -- we've had 3 long-term suppliers. We've added one recently, also an international supplier. We haven't really done much with domestic suppliers at all. We've got 3 very good suppliers that's been with us for a long time. We have a great deal of confidence that the fourth supplier will also be a high-quality supplier. We've done some testing in our facility in Trinidad, so we have no need to look further at this point.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Luke Folta with Jefferies.","Luke Folta - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, just a couple of quick ones, if I could. I think we've tallied up there being, I think, about 10 potential OCTG new projects coming in to North America. Some of them will have steel capacity and most won't. I was curious to know if Nucor has done anything and even speaking with the -- these new potential customers as far as Nucor's potential ability to source substrate, whether it be flat-rolled or bar products to those mills.","John J. Ferriola","It's a great question. I can tell you that we have every single one of them, and we're in discussions with every single one of them. We're even in some discussions with new suppliers or new production facilities that currently have plans to provide their own substrate. We're in discussions with them, working actively to convince them that advantageous to do business with us and avoid the capital expenditure of building their own smelting facilities.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","So at this point, you say that the prospects are pretty good, that Nucor has meaningful participation in those mills?","John J. Ferriola","We've got a great commercial team. We're confident that they're going to be successful.","Luke Folta - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. All right, and then second one just relates to the DRI strategy. So when the -- so understand the DRI plant will, in part, probably displace some pig iron that you're currently bringing in from overseas or elsewhere. And then perhaps some of it will displace some prime scrap that you're purchasing domestically. And, I guess, I'm just trying to -- I mean, those kind of accomplished different things. And I just wanted to see if I can get a sense of initially, at least, when we bring the second plant up, is that mostly going to be just a pig iron offset?","John J. Ferriola","It's really a question going back to our earlier question. It's a question of flexibility. What this is giving us is the ability to make those decisions and optimize the feedstock that goes into our furnaces. We'll take a look at the current pricing situation among all the iron units that are out there and available, fine scrap, HBI iron, pig iron, DRI and make the best decision to optimize the mix to reduce our cost going into the furnace. So we don't have a definitive plan on replacing pig iron or how much DRI will use in place of pig iron or prime scrap. We'll take a look, frankly, on a very regular basis, at what the best, lowest cost mix of iron units is available, and that's what we'll use.","Operator","And there are no further questions in the queue.","John J. Ferriola","Okay. I'd like to make some -- Dana, I'd like to make some closing comments. So I'll go ahead and do it. I guess, we're still online.","Operator","Go ahead, sir.","John J. Ferriola","Okay, thank you, Dana. At Nucor, we recognize the challenges of a weak economy and the tsunami of imports resulting from ineffective trade policies. And we will continue to fight to eliminate those challenges. But I want to stress that in the meantime, we will continue to do what Nucor does best. We will focus on the issues that are within our control. We will continue to grow profitably. We will continue to execute better than anyone else in the industry. And we will ensure that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. Thank you, all, for joining our call today. Let's keep it going by working together. Thank you.","Operator","Again, that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation."],"16357":["Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) Q1 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call April 19, 2018  2:00 PM ET","Executives","John Ferriola - Chairman, CEO, and President","James Frias - CFO and EVP","Chad Utermark - EVP, Fabricated Construction Products","Analysts","Martin Englert - Jefferies","Curt Woodworth - Credit Suisse","Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Novid Rassouli - Cowen and Company","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets ","Operator","Good day everyone and welcome to the Nucor Corporation First Quarter of 2018 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will come at that time.","Certain statements made during the conference call will be forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The word we expect, believe, anticipate and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify those forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and information that is currently available.","Although Nucor believes that -- believes they are based on reasonable assumptions, there are -- there can be no assurance that future events will not affect their accuracy. More information about the risks and uncertainties related to these forward-looking statements may be found in the Nucor's latest 10-K and subsequently filed 10-Qs, which are available on the SEC's and Nucor's website.","The forward-looking statements made in this conference call speak only as of the date, and Nucor does not assume any obligation to update them, either as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to John Ferriola, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President of Nucor Corporation. Please go ahead.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. We appreciate your interest in Nucor. Joining me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's Executive team; Jim Darsey, responsible for Raw Materials; Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Ladd Hall, responsible for Sheet and Tubular Products; Ray Napolitan, responsible for Engineered Bar Products; Joe Stratman, our Chief Digital Officer; Dave Sumoski, responsible for Merchant Bar and Rebar Products; Leon Topalian, responsible for Beam and Plate Products; and Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated Construction Products.","Earlier this week, Jim Darsey announced his plans to retire from Nucor on June 9th after 39 years of outstanding service to Nucor. Jim has been an exceptional leader. He has made strong contributions in each of our three major businesses: downstream products, steelmaking, and raw materials. Jim, thank you for your outstanding contribution to Nucor's long-term record of profitable growth and to our company's unique culture, which is unquestionably our greatest asset.","Effective June 10th, Craig Feldman will be promoted to Executive Vice President of Raw Materials. Craig is a proven Nucor leader with 33 years of experience with the David J. Joseph Company. He is well prepared to continue Nucor's profitable growth in raw materials.","Before we review Nucor's first quarter of 2018 results and strategic execution, I would like to share my view on our team's performance. The Nucor team is delivering profitable growth. It is long-term growth built on a solid foundation of sustainability. It is growth that creates value for Nucor's customers, employees and shareholders. It is driven by disciplined execution of our five drivers to profitable growth.","Here are the five drivers the Nucor team utilizes to create value. One, being a low-cost producer, striving for continual improvement in everything we do; two, being a market leader in the markets in which we compete; three, moving up the value chain to expand our capabilities for our value-appreciative customers; four, expanding our channels to market; and five, achieving commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength.","I also want to highlight another important point regarding the current debate over our government's trade policies. What some people forget is that free trade does not mean free-for-all trade. There are rules, rules that have been agreed to and adopted by all nations of the international trading community. It is critical that these agreements and the trade laws are rigorously enforced. Enforcing them ensures that everyone is playing by the same rules.","Nucor thrives in a marketplace where winners are determined by real economic advantage, not by artificial and unlawful advantages. Our ability to create value for our customers increases when we are able to compete on a level playing field. For that reason, Nucor applauds the ongoing work of the U.S. government to address the massive volume of dumped and illegally subsidized steel products that have been flooding into our country at historic levels.","Jim Frias will now review Nucor's first quarter performance and financial position. Following those comments, I will update you on the execution of our strategy for long-term profitable growth. Jim? ","James Frias","Thanks John. Nucor reported first quarter of 2018 earnings of $1.10 per diluted share. As indicated in our guidance last month, first quarter results included an expense of $0.07 per diluted share related to the write-off of certain deferred tax assets.","Earnings momentum accelerated during the first quarter, especially at our Steelmaking Operations with significant metal margin expansion during the month of March. This momentum was partially offset or deferred by the timing impact of Nucor's significant vertical integration. Comparing the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017, intercompany inventory eliminations resulted in an adverse swing of about $70 million on Nucor's pretax profits.","Our strong improvement in first quarter earnings before taxes from the fourth quarter highlighted the value we derive from Nucor's product breadth. In addition to significantly higher quarter-over-quarter profitability at our sheet mills, strong gains were achieved by a large percentage of our broad portfolio, including engineered bar, merchant bar and rebar, structural steel, plate steel, tubular products, cold finish bar and our raw materials businesses.","Our steel mills benefited from higher levels of capacity utilization and significant margin expansion. Earnings of the raw materials segment increased on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis, driven by improvements at both our scrap operations and our DRI production facilities.","Here are some noteworthy raw materials performance highlights: The David J. Joseph scrap business reported its strongest quarterly profits since the third quarter of 2008. Our DRI plant in Trinidad, building on its record production and profit performance in 2017, posted solid first quarter earnings.","The Louisiana DRI facility achieved consistent operations while delivering its second-highest quarterly production shipments and earnings. We are encouraged by the Louisiana team's heightened focus on the key elements of execution; people, process and equipment. Substantial work remains ahead for the team, but we are very confident in our improvement plans and the people implementing them.","Our first quarter of 2018 earnings also benefited from tax reform legislation that was effective this year. Excluding earnings attributable to non-controlling interest and the one-time write-off of deferred tax assets, the effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.3%.","Nucor's financial position is strong. With total debt outstanding of $3.8 billion, our gross debt to capital ratio was 29% at the end of the first quarter of 2018. Nucor's strong liquidity position includes our cash holdings of $760 million and our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility's maturity was recently extended to April of 2023.","For 2018, we estimate capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion. That represents a large increase from 2017 capital spending of $450 million. Approximately two-thirds of planned 2018 capital expenditures are for expansion, product improvement and cost savings projects, with the remaining one-third for maintenance purposes.","Nucor's capital allocation priorities are clear and they've been consistently practiced over many years. Our first priority is to invest for profitable growth. Our growth strategy is simple and flexible, leveraging our five drivers to profitable growth.","Our second priority is to return cash to our shareholders, primarily with cash dividends consistent with our success in delivering long-term earnings growth. Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase our stock when our cash position is strong and our shares are attractively priced.","We intend to continue Nucor's long-term history of being effective stewards of our shareholders' valuable capital. Our conservative financial practices and highly variable cost structure allow us to invest for future growth and provide value to our shareholders in both good times and bad.","Over the challenging nine-year period from 2009 through 2017, Nucor returned $4.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while over the same time period, investing $8.3 billion in attractive growth opportunities.","Nucor generally targets to return a minimum of 40% of it's through the cycle earnings to shareholders by regular dividends, supplemental dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.","Earnings in the second quarter of 2018 are expected to increase significantly compared to the first quarter. Orders and backlog are robust throughout Nucor's portfolio of steel and steel products businesses. We believe there is sustainable strength in steel end-use markets. Nucor's focus remains on delivering high returns on our invested capital by taking care of our customers.","Thank you for your interest in our company. John?","John Ferriola","Thanks Jim. Nucor's disciplined strategy of profitable growth is working. Our 2017 earnings were Nucor's highest annual earnings since the cyclical peak year of 2008. That positive momentum has carried over into 2018, as evidenced by our strong first quarter earnings and a bullish second quarter outlook.","We are seeing stronger demand throughout the U.S. economy. Recent tax and regulatory reforms have reduced uncertainty and improved confidence. As a result, we are seeing a robust pipeline of projects and strong overall business activity.","21 of the 24 end-use markets served by Nucor are experiencing stable to improving demand. End markets that are particularly important to Nucor are especially strong in 2018, including energy, most of the construction markets Nucor serves and heavy equipment.","With this improved demand, the Nucor team is only beginning to realize the significant pent-up earnings power from investments made during the economic downturn. As Jim just noted, Nucor invested more than $8 billion over the nine-year period running from 2009 through 2017.","Here is just one example of how our investments are paying off. Nucor Tubular Products, acquired in late 2016 and early 2017, continues to generate strong volume and better than expected earnings. Our tubular and sheet mill teammates are working together very effectively to achieve synergies that allow Nucor to better serve customers in the construction market with our broader product offerings.","The tubular team has embraced Nucor's pay-for-performance system and set first quarter production records. At the same time, our sheet mills continue to benefit from profitable baseload tons from the Nucor tubular facilities. Nucor's sheet mill shipments to this value-added channel to market are expected to grow from 720,000 tons in 2017 to more than 1 million tons in 2018.","With these improvements in market demand, Nucor is primed and ready to create increased value for our shareholders. We are doing it by leveraging our significant product offerings and an unrelenting focus on achieving commercial excellence in taking care of our customers.","While reviewing Nucor's performance in 2017 and early 2018, it is important to examine the steel industry environment in which we are achieving strong volume and earnings growth.","Specifically, illegally traded imports remain a very serious and yet to be resolved challenge. Finished steel imports in 2017 captured 27% of the U.S. market. In the first quarter, they remained at relatively high levels, estimated to be 25% of market share. Nucor will continue to fight aggressively for free and fair trade.","The Nucor team continues to develop attractive opportunities for profitable growth. Currently, we are executing seven exciting growth initiatives that total about $1.3 billion in invested capital.","Three of the projects are in our sheet business, a $230 million specialty cold-rolling facility at our Arkansas sheet mill with about 500,000 tons of annual capacity and scheduled for start-up in the first half of 2019. It will greatly expand our capabilities to serve the light-weighting needs of the automotive market.","A $176 million hot band galvanizing line at our Kentucky sheet mill with 500,000 tons of estimated annual capacity and set for start-up in the first half of 2019. It will expand our share of the Midwest coated sheet market and support further expansion into automotive products.","A $270 million sheet galvanizing facility in Mexico being constructed with our joint venture partner, JFE Steel, with approximately 400,000 tons of annual capacity and on-track for a production start in the second half of 2019. It is centrally located to serve Mexico's growing automotive market and will obtain half of its substrate from our Berkeley sheet mill.","The other four of these projects are in our long products business. An $85 million modernization of the rolling mill at our Ohio rebar mill with about 400,000 tons of annual capacity and completion expected in the first half of 2019. This project enhances our low-cost producer and market leadership position in the Ohio market.","A $180 million merchant bar rolling facility at our Illinois bar mill with 500,000 tons of estimated annual capacity and a production start date expected in late 2019. We will benefit on multiple logistical advantages and will displace tons supplied by competitors outside the region.","A $250 million rebar micro mill outside of Kansas City, Missouri with about 350,000 tons of annual capacity and a start-up set for late 2019. A $240 million rebar micro mill in Central Florida with 350,000 tons of estimated annual capacity and a start-up expected in the first half of 2020. These micro mills are also a logistics play that expands Nucor market leadership and a low-cost producer position in the rebar business.","For a company such as Nucor, with our unique position of strength and our proven ability to execute profitable growth strategies, this is a time of great opportunity. Our team is both ready and eager to demonstrate the pent-up earnings power that we have built into our company during our industry's downturn.","As always, the more than 25,000 men and women of Nucor are the reason that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. Nucor's senior leadership team in Charlotte would like to thank all of our teammates throughout Nucor for working together to build a safer, stronger and more profitable Nucor. Thank you.","We would now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","We'll take our first question from Martin Englert with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Martin Englert","Hi, good afternoon everyone and congratulations on the strong results.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon. Thank you.","Martin Englert","There was a notable improvement within the raw materials segment of profitability and you touched on this in the release and then some of your commentary. But can you discuss what's changed at the Louisiana DRI facility and what incremental work you have planned there?","John Ferriola","Yes, I'd be happy to. The improvement in the raw materials segment was twofold. D. J. Joseph team did a good job during the first quarter. They contributed to the good results in the first quarter, so we thank them for all that hard work.","And in Louisiana, they had a very good quarter in terms of production and shipments and profit. It's the second-best quarter ever. So, good work and congratulations and thanks to the team there.","In terms of what are we doing, it's really a focus -- and I mentioned it briefly in terms of people, process and equipment and it's a focus on making sure -- to focus on making sure that we take care of the details that we know how to take care of on a steel plant and on an iron plant. And that's focusing on things like preventive maintenance, taking care of the equipment the way we should be taking care of the equipment and training. Training the teammates to make sure that they're ready for the -- all of the situations that can occur in the DRI facility and that's paid big dividends.","We are still doing a detailed examination, investigation into the equipment and we're not ready to talk about what modifications we'll have to make to the equipment in that facility right now. We should be ready maybe by the next fall, sometime around the middle of the year, towards the end of the year. We'll have completed the engineering study and we can talk to you more about the equipment changes or modifications that we need to make.","But we're pleased with what the team is doing. I will point out that I mentioned the focus on preventive maintenance. And in the second quarter, around July -- June 18, I think is the exact date, we will be taking the facility down for 30 days. This is a practice that we've done forever in Trinidad and it's taken down to perform the annual preventive maintenance so that we can ensure greater reliability for the rest of the year when we're running. So, that will be taking place in the second quarter. And it's part of our renewed focus on people, process and maintaining the equipment in the way that it should be maintained. ","Martin Englert","Thanks for all the detail there. Within the downstream steel products segment, can you discuss some of the margin trends that you're seeing maybe on a more granular level such as rebar fabrication given the rising substrate cost?","John Ferriola","Well, Chad, I'll let you start with that. And Chad is in charge of our downstream businesses. So, Chad, why don't you take first shot at that?","Chad Utermark","Yes. Thanks John. Our backlogs on our downstream fabricated businesses remain very healthy. They are growing. We continue to see strong end-use demand across our portfolio of downstream products. Year-over-year quotes, orders and backlogs are up significantly.","Yes, we have experienced some margin compression resulting from the recent increase in steel pricing. However, each of our downstream fabricated businesses are responsible for selling value and being profitable. So, overall, our current backlog remains profitable in this current steel pricing environment.","Martin Englert","Okay, excellent. Thanks for the detail.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Curt Woodworth","Yes, good afternoon everyone.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon.","Curt Woodworth","Maybe to start, John, on the rebar expansion. So, 700,000 tons. I think on my numbers, it's about 7% addition to U.S. supply. But by the same vein, imports were down over a million tons annualized the last four months. The AISI data is running up, I think, close to 900,000 on domestic shipment recovery.","So, can you talk to the decision around doing two micro mills, say, instead of one? How do you see Turkey and kind of exemption risk playing into that? Was 232 part of your thought process at all in terms of allocating more capital to rebar? And can you comment on what your rebar utilization rate was this quarter?","John Ferriola","Well, let me start. There are several questions in there, but let me start by talking in general about the strategy that surrounded the decision to build two micro mills. I mentioned this in the last call, but it's all began with a detailed market study and a market analysis that we did both of rebar and merchant product throughout the United States and the conclusion that we came to was twofold.","Number one, we recognized that we didn't have all of our production in the right locations. So, we had to do a little bit of rationalization, a little bit of switching some of our products and some of the locations in which we produce that product so that we could better serve the local markets surrounding those facilities and take advantage of logistical costs.","And when we did that, we realized that they gave us an opportunity in two areas, one in Florida and one in Missouri, by near the Sedalia area, where we saw pockets of market demand for rebar that were currently being served by competitors outside that market.","So, when we looked at this, we said there's three things we are looking to accomplish and we believe we will accomplish when we start up those facilities. Number one, obviously, we're going to be adding to our footprint and we give better coverage to our customers on a national footprint basis.","Number two; it's a better rationalization of our mills. We'll be producing the products at the mill most appropriate to produce it from a logistics perspective and from a scrap availability perspective.","And then number three, specific to those two micro mills, being located in regions where currently the market is being served by competitors outside the local region and in areas where we have a good supply of scrap that's under our control through the David J. Joseph Company. So, we expect to have a significant logistical advantage both on the scrap side and on the shipment to the customer side.","So, that was a strategy behind the decision to go with building the two micro mills. Now certainly, the fact that we have -- still have confidence that 232 will have an impact on the level of imports of rebar coming into the country that certainly plays into it. That gives us a little bit level -- additional level of confidence in the success of these mills, but it was really driven by the point that I mentioned earlier.","James Frias","John, one other thing that's maybe worth adding is the idea that Kankakee is going to shift its product mix with some of the investments we're making there to make more merchants. And right now, they're primarily a rebar mill. So, while we're adding rebar in one place, we're taking spring bar out in another.","John Ferriola","And that plays to what we've talked about. We're really doing a study and taking a look at making sure that we produce the products that the market demands in the area that they are being produced.","So, I'd tell you, we did -- I applaud our teams on both the rebar and the merchant side. They did a great job on the market analysis and I'm confident that we're going to be in a much better position to serve the market and improve our margins at the same time.","Curt Woodworth","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up with regards to -- the comment that metal spread, the exit rate. Obviously, 1Q is significantly higher than the average or where you started. Can you give us a sense on potential upside to metal spreads or maybe where the March level was versus the quarter, so we can get a better sense for how it could look 2Q? Thank you.","John Ferriola","Well, as we went through the first quarter, we were still seeing the price of scrap increasing and we -- and when you look at the rate in which the scrap price was increasing during the first quarter and at the same time, the slower rate that the CRU was advancing as pricing was moving up, you saw some of the margins begin to improve towards the end of the quarter.","We think scrap now has pretty much stabilized as we look at scrap going forward. We see it, particularly on the obsolete side, maybe down a little bit, but certainly stabilized. On the prime side, probably more stable. Not too much down movement, but stable.","And we believe that based upon our contracts, as we look forward into the second quarter, we see pricing continuing to improve on our contract business and on our spot business. With stable scrap pricing and increasing selling price, we should see margin expansion as we move into the second quarter.","Curt Woodworth","Understood. Thanks guys.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Timna Tanners","Hey good afternoon everyone.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon Timna.","Timna Tanners","I wanted to delve into a little bit further, the build-out of galvanized and I know maybe it's a bit -- that's been a longer-term philosophy and plan, but the hot-rolled market is particularly tight and the galvanized premiums have been coming down. Who supplies hot-rolled when Nucor ships more into value-add? Is there not an opportunity for Nucor to also supply that market?","So, I guess, that's one question about galvanized versus hot-rolled and that opportunity. But in line with that, just wondering, how do we think about Nucor's opportunity to take share in light of falling imports in the sheet market?","John Ferriola","Okay. Well, let me start with the first question and you hit the question about galvanizing. We believe it's been a long-term strategy of ours to improve the value-added products out of our sheet business. And when you look at projects we've got going on today with the galv line in Mexico, the galv line at Gallatin and the cold mill at Hickman, value-added products coming out of our sheet mill will improve by about 10%.","So, it'll go somewhere -- today, it's somewhere in the neighborhood of about 37% value-added. That will go up to about 47%. We think that that's an important long-term strategy.","You mentioned about the hot band. And certainly, as I've said before, we always think of our investments in terms of long-term. Yes, right now, hot band is strong. There's some pressure on hot band, so pricing looks good on hot band. But over the course of this -- of the cycle, we think value-added products always give us a little bit better margin.","And as to your second question, which was about who's going to produce the hot band needed to galvanize if we move more of our product from hot banded to galvanized, that's an easy answer. We challenge our teams to produce more hot bands on the mills that we have, okay. And if we see an opportunity in the future, we'll take the appropriate actions and -- to meet the needs of the market through investments. So, we don't see that as an issue. So, we're confident in both of those things.","One of the key things that I would mention that, again, when you look at hot band, cold-rolled, and galvanized is making sure that we maintain that diversity so that we have the flexibility to move as the market shifts. You know our business; it goes up and down in hot band, cold-rolled and galv. And we want to have the ability to produce the products that are needed, whatever the market -- the given market is at the given time. So, that's why we're moving in that direction.","Timna Tanners","Okay, great. And then I want to shift gears and ask you a little bit about the balance sheet. I know over the years, you've held a really large cash position and this quarter is unusually light. Can you just talk to us about maybe your philosophy there? What's the minimum level of cash necessary in the balance sheet? Are you changing your view there? Certainly, there's a big inventory build, so maybe that was just temporary. But if you wouldn't mind expanding a bit on the balance sheet. Thanks.","James Frias","Sure. I'll talk about that, Timna. We're constantly analyzing market conditions, our balance sheet and our future plans. We think of our minimum cash balance as being probably in the neighborhood of $500 million. So, we're not there. And of course, with our strong credit rating, we have a lot of flexibility on how we respond to cash needs.","Timna Tanners","Can you comment on the inventory build then, perhaps? Is that just a seasonal phenomenon maybe with the rising price and--","James Frias","Yes, that's a good question. Working capital, in general, for our business always goes up counter cyclically. So, when prices go up for scrap and prices go up for our selling prices, both inventories and receivables build, and we're seeing that right now. And of course, the opposite happens.","So, if you looked at our free cash flow and our cash from operations, our cash from operations, particularly in 2015, when energy prices collapsed and the sheet market faced more challenging times, again, that number was $2 billion of cash from operations. So, right now, in an up cycle, working capital is using more cash. That's just kind of common.","Timna Tanners","Okay, makes sense. Thanks again.","John Ferriola","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Novid Rassouli with Cowen and Company. please go ahead.","Novid Rassouli","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm just wondering if you can discuss your expectations for May imports given the Section 232 exemption is set to expire on May 1st. Obviously, those would be imports coming in or being licensed two to three months ago. So, arguably, we could see a steep drop-off given the lack of clarity. Just wanted to get your guys thoughts around that.","John Ferriola","Well, there certainly is a lack of clarity. There's no doubt about that. And it's tough to answer that question without knowing exactly what's going to happen. So, let me tell you what we certainly hope and what we expect to happen given the President's commitments to our industry.","Number one, we need and we expect May 1st to be a firm date. There needs to be no more delays, no more extensions on this. And it needs to be where -- he's promised that if we can't come to some reasonable renegotiated agreements, then we hold firm with a 25% tariff applied to the countries that have not been exempted. But we hope that is the case.","It's hard to predict what's going to happen with the imports. Hopefully, as I said, we -- March -- the May -- excuse me, the May 1st day is firm. And then we would expect to see one or two things happen; either imports would go down or if the demand in our country necessitates it. Imports would continue, but they would continue at the fair market price having paid the 25% tariff.","So, one of the things that I hear a lot of about and is concerned about is shortage of steel in the future after the May 1st date. And I can assure you, there's going to be no shortage. There's a tightness in the marketplace certainly. That's a result of demand improvement. The economy is better. Demand is up. Tax reform has contributed to that. The regulation has contributed to that. And to some extent, the partial implementation of the 232 has contributed to that.","But the result -- the bottom line is demand has gone up. If steel needs to come into the country, it will come in. People will pay the tariff, and they'll bring the product in, and they'll bring it in a fair price.","I like to say that I can -- I'm confident that there's not going to be a shortage of steel in this country. There might be a shortage of dumped or illegally traded steel in the country, but there will not be a shortage of steel.","Novid Rassouli","So, is it safe to say that as far as conversation with your customers, nobody's panicking or trying to secure greater tonnage with you guys post May 1st?","John Ferriola","No. We -- when we talk to our customers, they -- and we ask them quite frankly. Do you see a shortage or do you see a tightening? And the answer we get is, we see a tightening. And as I mentioned, the tightening is a result of a lot of things. But primarily, demand is up. I would point to when you look at our utilization rates last year and the first quarter of last year, they were already fairly high. And when you look at the utilization rates in the first quarter of this year, it's a little bit higher, a couple of percentage points, three or four percentage points higher. So, our customers have confidence on our ability to supply them, and we won't let them down.","Novid Rassouli","Got it. And just one more follow-up if I may. On scrap, you had mentioned that you think that scrap has basically stabilized. But meanwhile, we've been seeing Turkish scrap prices drifting lower over the past month. U.S. scrap center was fairly bullish about a month ago and then the April increase in prices kind of fell short of expectations. Just wanted to see if the weakness abroad has been impacting the U.S. market at all or if you think it could?","John Ferriola","Well, that certainly affects. Absolutely does impact the U.S. market. But I'd also add to it, we're coming into spring. The scrap flows a little bit better in the spring, but they're particularly obsolete.","On the prime side, I've -- we'll take a little credit and brag on the fact that we think the DRI facility, running so well as it did in the first quarter, contributes to putting a cap on the prime scrap number.","So, yes, the reduced exports and the improved flow of scrap in the United States because of spring, we think that's the primary reasons that the obsolete will be stable to down. And given the DRI and other alternative materials coming into the country today, prime scrap we think will be pretty stable going forward also.","Novid Rassouli","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Philip Gibbs","Hey good afternoon.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon Phil. How are you?","Philip Gibbs","Good, well. How are you?","John Ferriola","Very well. Thank you.","Philip Gibbs","Good. Jim, you had mentioned I think in your script that there was a certain lag impact. I just wanted to be certain that I heard that correctly and what that may have been.","James Frias","Regards to -- I don't remember having the words a lag impact. So, you must be reading something in between the lines. You're talking about the momentum of margins as we went through the quarter?","Philip Gibbs","No, I thought you had mentioned something -- well, it was maybe along the lines of a $70 million [Indiscernible]","James Frias","Yes, yes. So, our corporate elims line has a number of components. It includes interest expense, corporate overhead, intercompany profit, eliminations and then incentive-based compensation. And I was speaking to one subcomponent of that line, and that's intercompany profit. And if we compare the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, it was a $70 million drag by comparison and that should be lower in the second quarter.","John Ferriola","Eliminations.","James Frias","Yes, intercompany eliminations.","Philip Gibbs","Okay. What was the thought in reclassifying some of the tubular and piling businesses?","James Frias","Yes, that's a good question, too. Last year was the first year where we had both piling and tubular in that steel products segment together in our 10-K. And we got feedback from a number of investors that said, it seems to us that makes more sense in steel products than in steel mills. And so we reevaluated and cited that was probably a better answer and so we made that move.","Philip Gibbs","Okay. And then, John, I've got a question regarding this geopolitical situation in Russia. I know they're a big supplier to the U.S. of pig iron. Does that put more of a premium on the DRI operational execution, I guess, is one part of that comment that I'm making here. And then do you see a potential issue coming out of there just given everything that we're seeing going on in terms of the noise right now?","John Ferriola","No, it's impossible to predict what's going to happen on the geopolitical front. That goes without saying. But what we feel very good about here at Nucor is that we have options. We have flexibility regardless of what happens. If you do see something happen on the pig iron side, we have the DRI that we can count on.","Also having the great organization of D. J. Joseph as part of the Nucor family. That gives us a great deal of advantage, frankly, in terms of being able to secure scrap not only domestically, but frankly, from around the world, source alternative iron units from other places in the world. They've got contacts all over the world.","So, one of the things -- or the advantage that we have is that we've got options that we can take advantage of if something does happen in any one particular region of the world. We've got options both internal to our own company and through the David J. Joseph Company externally bringing iron units into our country. We don't worry too much about that.","Philip Gibbs","Okay, terrific. And just one last question from maybe a commercial operational standpoint. Where do you see your backlogs on the steel side on a product basis, maybe the longest or the tightest? And where might be there some shorter leads or weaker spots? Just trying to gauge the -- where we are in terms of the strength of the products. Thanks.","John Ferriola","Well, I'm not going to go product by product. That's the worse, but I will say that in terms of the tightest market we see right now is our sheet product. Maybe it's a more general statement and say in our flat products because plate is also pretty tight right now.","So, flat products, tighter. Long products, not as tight, although we do see some tightness in our structural market also. So, with the exception of structural, long products are a little bit looser. Flat products are tighter.","Philip Gibbs","Thanks John. Appreciate it.","John Ferriola","Hey, thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to John Ferriola for any additional or closing comments.","John Ferriola","Thank you, Ashley. Well, let me close by saying thank you to our customers. We appreciate the opportunity to partner with you and to earn your business every day. And always know that Nucor stands ready to seize new opportunities with you. And I want to say thank you to our shareholders. We appreciate your ongoing confidence in our team.","And finally, to my Nucor teammates, let's keep it going. Let's keep winning together. I'm confident our best years are still ahead of us. I want to thank you for what you do for Nucor every day. And most importantly, thank you for doing it safely. There is nothing more important than safety, absolutely nothing. Thank you all for your interest in Nucor. Have a great day.","Operator","And once again, that concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for your participation.

Please go ahead, sir.","John J. Ferriola","Good afternoon. This is John Ferriola, Nucor's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are Nucor's Executive Vice President Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Darsey, responsible for our bar mill, Cold Finish and Fastener businesses; Keith Grass, responsible for our scrap business and energy investments; Ladd Hall, responsible for our Sheet Mill and Direct Reduced Iron facilities; Ray Napolitan, responsible for our Fabricated Construction Product businesses; and Joe Stratman, responsible for our beam mills, plate mills, sheet piling and business development work.","First and most importantly, we want to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit, Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for your excellent work taking care of all of our customers. Each and every day, the more than 22,000 men and women of the Nucor team are building a stronger Nucor by working safely, working smart and working together, as has been the case since our company was founded nearly 5 decades ago. Nucor's employees, the right people are our company's greatest asset and our greatest competitive advantage.","Throughout Nucor, our teammates have been working hard to grow long-term earnings power. We have invested significant capital in recent years that we expect to convert into higher highs in profits over is the next upcycle. Two key drivers to the anticipated profit growth will be reducing our raw materials cost and expanding our product mix to include more value-added, higher-margin offerings. In the fourth quarter, we reached a number of significant milestones implementing these organic growth initiatives.","I will discuss these achievements after our CFO, Jim Frias, reviews our fourth quarter results and financial position. Jim?","James D. Frias","Thanks, John, and good afternoon. Fourth quarter 2013 earnings of $0.53 per diluted share included favorable out-of-period tax adjustments totaling $0.07 per diluted share. A lower-than-expected LIFO charge also benefited earnings by about $0.03 per share. Excluding these items, our results exceeded our guidance range of between $0.35 to $0.40 per share by approximately $0.03 per diluted share. This performance largely resulted from better-than-expected December profitability at our sheet and plate mills. Nucor continues to benefit from its position as North America's most diversified manufacturer of steel and steel products.","A comment about our tax rates can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting out profits belonging to our business partners and the out-of-period tax adjustment, the effective tax rate was 31% for the fourth quarter and 33% for the full year of 2013.","Balance sheet strength remains an important attribute of Nucor's business model. Nucor is the only steel producer in North America to enjoy the extremely important competitive advantage of an investment-grade credit rating. Our financial strength allows us to invest aggressively during the downturn to grow our long-term earnings power. At the end of 2013, Nucor's total debt-to-capital ratio was 36%. Cash, short-term investments and restricted cash totaled $1.5 billion.","For[ph] Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn and it does not mature until August 2018. We have no commercial paper outstanding and our next significant debt maturity is not until 2017.","Nucor's cash flow generation remained very healthy in 2013's challenging steel market conditions. Cash provided by operating activities last year was approximately $1.1 billion. Our balance sheet, liquidity and cash flow have allowed us to grow stronger during the current downturn. We have invested aggressively for profitable growth. 2013 capital expenditures exceeded $1.2 billion, that was more than double last year's depreciation expense of $536 million.","Since the last cyclical peak reached in 2008, Nucor has invested $8 billion in our businesses, $4.4 billion of capital spending and $3.6 billion of acquisitions. This broad range of strategic investments enhances Nucor's key competitive strengths. Those include a low-cost production situation, a diversified product mix and market leadership.","We have posted a slide package on our website that summarizes some of our major growth initiatives implemented during the current downturn. In his remarks, John Ferriola will provide updates on some of our more current projects.","With these investments, the Nucor team is preparing for the inevitable steel industry's cyclical upturn. Our unrelenting focus remains on realizing attractive returns on Nucor's invested capital, which now exceeds $9 billion at the end of 2013. We expect to build upon Nucor's long tradition of being an effective steward of shareholders valuable capital.","Return on invested capital for Nucor averaged 15.5% over the 10-year period ended in 2013. That 10-year period includes the most recent 5 years of the current downcycle, as well as the 5-year upcycle that ended in 2008. It is interesting to note that Nucor's return on invested capital averaged 25.5% during that last upcycle in the steel business. We expect significantly lower capital expenditures for 2014, as the majority of our growth projects will be completed in the first half of this year.","Also, we recently announced the joint decision with our natural gas working interest investment partner, Encana, to temporarily suspend drilling new wells until there is a sustainable improvement in natural gas pricing. Cessation of drilling will reduce Nucor's 2014 capital spending by about $400 million. As a result, we estimate our 2014 capital spending will be approximately $600 million. The suspension should significantly improve our free cash flow position this year. It also highlights the strong relationship we enjoy with Encana and how flexibly this investment is functioning to provide Nucor a capital-efficient hedge against high natural gas prices.","For the first quarter 2014, Nucor's earnings are expected to be similar to the fourth quarter level, excluding the tax adjustment. Our steel mills will benefit from having no major planned outages and we expect improved performance at our Louisiana DRI facility. However, these positive factors are likely to be largely offset by this year's unusually harsh winter weather, exacerbating the typical seasonal first quarter slowdown in our construction-related businesses on both the fabrication side and the steel mill side.","Overall, the outlook continues to be tempered by excess global steel capacity and the threat of steel illegally dumped into the United States. Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance in the final month of the quarter.","Our team is committed to executing on the opportunities we see ahead to reward Nucor shareholders with very attractive long-term returns on their valuable capital invested in our company. Our strong focus on growing long-term earnings shareholder value is evidenced by Nucor's dividend record, 41 consecutive years of increased base cash dividends paid to our shareholders effective with the upcoming quarterly payment on February 11, 2014. John?","John J. Ferriola","Thanks, Jim. Nucor's fourth quarter of 2013 performance was noteworthy for several important reasons. Our teammates delivered solid profitability in what are still very challenging markets. They achieved this while undertaking significant planned downtime for major capital projects at several of our larger steel mills. Those outages included: 4 weeks at our Nucor Steel Berkeley sheet mill; 2 weeks at our Nucor-Yamato structural steel mill; and 4 weeks at our Nebraska bar mill. We also absorbed the costs of starting production at our new Direct Reduced Iron or DRI plant in Louisiana. Further, I am pleased to report a number of impressive achievements in the ongoing implementation of our capital projects. These initiatives grow Nucor's long-term earnings power by providing us new higher-margin product offerings, cost reductions and quality improvements.","Our Nucor Steel Louisiana team began producing DRI on December 24. Within the first 24 hours of operation, output quality reached the world-class levels consistently achieved by our DRI plant in Trinidad that has been running since 2006. In fact, Louisiana's carbon content has recently exceeded Trinidad's best-in-class performance. Most importantly, the initial output from the Louisiana plant has performed very well at the Nucor mills that have consumed it.","I would like to thank everyone on our team in Louisiana for their hard work and ongoing commitment to getting the job done. The startup of the Louisiana DRI plant is a huge step forward in the implementation of our raw material strategy. We view our expanded DRI capacity, added with our low-cost and long-term natural gas supply, to be a game changer to Nucor's cost structure for the highly -- high-quality iron units we need to expand our share of the higher-value-added sheet, SBQ bar and plate markets.","It is also a game changer by improving Nucor's operating flexibility with a significantly shorter Nucor supply chain for high-quality iron users. As Jim mentioned, in December, we announced agreement with Encana to temporarily suspend the drilling for new natural gas wells, given the current gas price expectations for 2014. The drilling pause demonstrates the flexibility of our partnership to adapt to changing natural gas market conditions. This flexibility is allowing us to make the best capital allocation decisions for the current natural gas price environment.","Suspending drilling in today's gas markets is a win-win situation for Nucor. By the middle of 2014, when all in-process wells are completed, we will have just over 300 producing wells providing a full hedge to our Louisiana DRI plant's expected consumption into 2015. The cost structure of our drilled wells is such that they generate a modest positive return in 2013's low natural gas pricing environment. But with the gas requirements of the Louisiana facility hedged into next year, it is not a wise decision to use our valuable capital to invest more dollars in drilling for modest returns.","At the same time, we retain a valuable option to resume drilling in a higher natural gas pricing environment where drilling provides an attractive return on our investment, and we need to continue to hedge our gas consumption. Nucor and Encana will jointly decide when the time is right to resume drilling new wells.","In December, Nucor Steel Berkeley completed the installation of all caster and hot mill upgrades for its wide array of projects. This nearly $100 million investment provides Berkeley with the capability to produce wider and lighter gauge sheet steel. New product offerings will include 72-inch wide hot-rolled pickle and oil, 72-inch wide cold-rolled and gauges as thin as 0.042 inches. The expanded product portfolio will allow Nucor to move up the value chain in agricultural, automotive, heavy equipment, machinery and pipe and tube applications.","On January 21, our Berkeley team made history as the first Nucor flat-rolled mill to produce 72-inch wide coils. This successful startup is timely, as there is already strong customer interest in our new wider and lighter products.","During the fourth quarter, our bar mill group achieved major progress implementing key components of its strategy to grow Nucor's participation in higher-margin SBQ products. Expanded SBQ product breadth will support profitable growth for Nucor in energy, automotive, heavy equipment, as well as other markets.","Our Nebraska mill successfully started up its upgraded rolling mill that includes new shears and straightening equipment. A significant improvement in lane control and quality of shear cuts already being experienced will allow us to move up the value chain in SBQ markets. It also includes our cost structure as a result of gains in rolling mill yields. In 2015, Nebraska will complete its product expansion program with an upgraded electrical arc furnace power system and the addition of a fifth caster strand[ph] .","Our Memphis, Tennessee, team has completed the installation and commissioning of a new quality assurance line, which allows us to provide engineered bars for the most demanding applications. I would also like to congratulate and thank the Memphis team on achieving record earnings in 2013. Consistent with the Nucor culture, the team's can-do attitude and high-energy level has allowed them to overcome many obstacles since their production startup at the onset of the current Great Recession in September of 2008. The potential for profitable growth at Memphis in the years ahead is sizable and very exciting.","Our Nucor Steel Hertford County plate mill continues to successfully execute our strategy to expand Nucor's participation in value-added plate markets. During the downturn, Hertford County has invested in a heat treat facility, a vacuum tank degasser and a normalizing line. These investments are already paying off. During the fourth quarter, Hertford achieved record heat treat shipments. Our Hertford team also received approval to produce naval armor and API plate for energy markets.","Our Nucor-Yamato structural mill is on schedule for a mid-2014 startup of an approximately $115 million project to expand its sheet piling production capabilities. These offerings will increase the single sheet piling widths by 22% and provide a lighter, stronger product resulting in lower installed cost. This initiative both moves Nucor-Yamato up the value-added chain in the piling business and allows us to realize more synergies from our highly successful 2012 acquisition of piling distributor, Skyline Steel.","The Nucor teams work to build sustainable long-term profitability require that we take a proactive role in our nation's trade policy debates. Global steel production overcapacity is the greatest threat to Nucor and to our entire industry. Illegal government subsidies from China and other countries have allowed large amounts of cost-inefficient capacity to stay in production and dump steel into the global marketplace.","To this point, imports have significantly increased their share of the U.S. market since 2009, while the domestic industry's capacity utilization remains stuck in the mid-70% range. On some products, such as rebar, domestic industry capacity utilization is even lower in the mid-60% range. With the U.S. industry's capacity utilization this low, imports are not needed in the U.S. market. They come here not because of demand, but because of foreign producers' excess capacity and on badly[ph] traded pricing.","Nucor is working hard to bring attention to the need for our government to enforce rules-based trading. We have fought 2 rulings in recent months by the U.S. International Trade Commission. In December, the U.S. ITC rolled in[ph] a 5-year sunset review to keep in place existing anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders on hot-rolled sheet steel imports from China, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand and Ukraine. In November, the U.S. ITC preliminary determined that there is a reasonable indication that imports of rebar from Mexico and Turkey have materially injured or threatened with injury U.S. rebar producers.","While these rulings are encouraging to us, we understand that much work remains in the fight for effective and timely enforcement of our nation's trade laws. Supporting our fight is the undisputable fact that American producers are among the lowest-cost producers of steel in the world.","We enter 2014 with great confidence and optimism about Nucor's future. Our team had invested significant capital during the current downturn to grow Nucor's long-term earnings power. Our balance sheet strength is unrivaled by any of our competitors. Our cash flow generation remains healthy throughout the cycle and will benefit from 2014's expected decline in capital spending. Our industry-leading product diversity continues to grow as we move up the value chain in all of our businesses. Our low-cost structure will benefit from the implementation of our raw material strategy and increased DRI production capacity. And most importantly, Nucor's culture remains as strong as ever.","In closing, I would like to comment on Dan Dimicco's retirement on December 31 from his position as Nucor's Executive Chairman. Those of you who followed Nucor regularly know that we enjoyed unprecedented growth in profitability and shareholder value over his 12-year tenure as our CEO and leader. Dan's work[ph] for Nucor, under his leadership, is simply incredible. Dan, thank you. Your leadership has positioned Nucor well to continue our journey of climbing up the mountain with no top. We would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask you a couple things. First on how are things going on your automotive strategy and what do you see over the next few years? And the second thing will be on -- a little bit more color on your natural gas. But let's just start with the auto strategy?","John J. Ferriola","Well, as I've mentioned several times in previous calls, Nucor continues to develop and get qualified for advanced high-strength steels in applications in automotive. We particularly are focused on, as I mentioned in the past, unexposed applications. I'm happy to report that the qualification process is continuing and we're doing quite well in both cold-rolled and galvanized. We're moving well into the qualification period and we expect imminent supply contracts. In fact, I can tell you that, as we speak, we do have already in use, in exposed applications, steel products on cars in production and out on the roads today. So on the sheet side, we continue to progress well on the qualification and implementation phase of moving into exposed automotive and other automotive applications. In SBQ, we continue to move up the value chain also. We are currently producing crankshaft steel for several driveshafts. We produce axle steel at our Norfolk, Nebraska plant. And as we mentioned in the script, we've made a lot of investments during the past downturn to continue to get better at that with degassers. Our wide light project at Berkeley will help us continue to move up into the automotive exposed arena. And of course, we have our automotive-rated galvanizing line indicator. So we feel pretty good about Nucor continuing to move into more automotive applications. And that's a focus of ours. Obviously, automotive is very strong now. We continue -- we believe it will continue to be strong for a while. So our focus will be to continue to move into more automotive applications.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, I was just wondering that this space is getting crowded with aluminum now entering the sheet market on the automotive side, and Thyssen's plant finally going to be sold to somebody who probably will be able to qualify soon. I'm just wondering is this how -- is it worth really pursuing that because, historically, you had shied away from that end market. Of course, this end market is doing very well right now because construction is down. But how much effort and money are you still willing to put in this thing to get where you want -- where you should have a critical mass in your hand?","John J. Ferriola","Well, I'm not sure that we're going after a major component of the business. And frankly, given the investments that we've already made, Sal, we don't see the need to make many more large investments in any of our facilities to move further into automotive. So we're pretty happy with where we're positioned from an equipment perspective. As I mentioned before, the qualification period in automotive is a very long process. It usually runs about 2 years. And given where we are in that process right now, we're pretty happy with the amount of business we've got. We do believe it will continue to grow, but we don't -- we are targeting in 2014 to increase it by about 5%. But -- and I want to comment on your question about aluminum. So let's take a look at aluminum. Yes, we recognize Ford's move into the aluminum arena with the F-150, but we still believe that steel, long-term, will be the material of choice for automotive production. When we compare it to aluminum, aluminum is 2x or 3x the initial cost of the steel. There is significant cost to retool the automotive production facilities. And the repair and insurance costs for car owners with aluminum, we believe, will be significantly higher. So we still see a major role for steel in automotive. And Nucor, frankly, as well as the rest of the industry, continue to focus on developing high -- advanced high-strength steels that will result in light weighting for the vehicles that's similar to aluminum and do it more effectively.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Meredith Bandy from BMO Capital Markets.","Meredith H. Bandy - BMO Capital Markets Canada","I wondered if we could just go a little bit bigger picture. There's been a lot of talk in the market, generally, about a manufacturing renaissance in the United States, and I was wondering what your take on that is? And do you see data to support a renaissance or would you say that it's more anecdotal at this point? How do you think about it?","John J. Ferriola","Well, we agree very strongly with the statement that the gas, the shale gas revolution will, in fact, result in a manufacturing renaissance in the United States. And I don't have the data at my fingertips, but there is quite a bit of data out there supporting that position. The amount of investment in manufacturing over the last 2 to 3 years is measured in the billions of new projects. We see it all the time as we visit with our customers and we get in the form of a customer feedback. We -- there's Caterpillar, for one, is moving back into the States, moving some production back into the States. Several of the large equipment manufacturers are moving production facilities back into the States. So we think it is very real. We think it's very significant. And we are investing in our company to be ready for that renaissance when it occurs. That's what the $8 billion of investments we've made over the last couple of years is all about. We believe it's coming. We believe we'll be ready for it and we believe we will be best positioned to take advantage of it.","Meredith H. Bandy - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. And then what is the potential upside to Nucor like if you look at your total -- what's the ability to move in terms of either the number of shipments you can get or perhaps also the widening of margins that I think you talked about in your prepared remarks?","John J. Ferriola","As relates specifically to the renaissance in manufacturing, it's hard to quantify that number. I think I'll leave it with the fact that we've invested heavily. We've grown not only our buying but more importantly, we've grown our value-added offerings to the marketplace. And as manufacturing comes back, you need those higher-valued, qualified steels, advanced strength and others, to fill the needs of the production that will be returning to the United States.","James D. Frias","Meredith, this is Jim Frias, I want to comment on that. We've been operating the last few years in the 70% steel mill utilization rate. And historically, normal markets in the past, not just the cyclical peak we saw in 2004 to 2008, we more typically operated in the low- to mid-90s of our capacity utilization. So that would suggest to you that there's a 20% to 25% upside just in the volumes, on top of whatever the margin benefit is.","John J. Ferriola","And I might also just add to Jim's comments that as manufacturing moves back in, it's going to need buildings. Those buildings are going to need foundations. We have rebar, we have the foundation of rebar formation -- forming companies. We have rebar placing companies. We have metal buildings that we could supply to them. So as you see them moving back in, you'll see our downstream businesses benefit from that renaissance also, as well as our steel producing divisions.","Operator","Our next question is from Luke Folta with Jefferies & Company.","Luke Folta - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","First question on the DRI plant. It sounds like, I guess, besides the storage tank issue that has gone as good as you can expect, as good as you can hope. Now that, that's starting to ramp, can you give us an idea of when you think you can ramp the plant to full capacity? And also, I thought it was kind of interesting you pointed out that it reduces your supply chain on the iron unit side, that makes full sense. Is there a working capital release that you expect this year as you ramp that plant up?","John J. Ferriola","You want to take the...","James D. Frias","I'll take the working capital part and then let John answer the first half of the question. The working capital benefit is going to be relatively small because it depends on how much we shift away from pig iron as the year goes on. And versus, maybe, using less prime scrap. So I shouldn't say small, it's a fairly broad range, is the way I should describe it. We currently carry -- we're going to look up, while we're on the call, how much inventory we carry in pig iron and maybe give you a little tighter answer on that.","John J. Ferriola","Yes. Well, one thing that I would want to remind you of is that one of the real benefits of the DRI facility is flexibility, as well as a shorter supply chain. We will have the ability to switch iron units as pricing changes for the various commodities. Now that's a really important point. And Jim, you'll look that up. But I want to mention a couple things about the startup at the DRI plant. First of all, I want to again thank our team in Louisiana. A great bunch of guys, they did a great job working under very difficult circumstances. We had, as you mentioned, the dome situation, which was a setback. Our team found a workaround for that in the typical Nucor way. We like to say at Nucor, when we have a crisis, we run towards it, we don't run away from it. And certainly, when we had the dome failure, there was a need to run towards that situation and we did it, and the team did a great job coming up with a phenomenal workaround. That DRI facility is the largest DRI facility anywhere in the world. And as such, it's a complex operation, and there'll be some bumps in the road. But I'm happy to say that in addition to the phenomenal quality that I've mentioned earlier, I mean, within 24 hours to be up to quality levels that we've been achieving, world-class quality levels that we're achieving in Trinidad, that's an outstanding performance. We are currently running just slightly above 80% of capacity, that's pretty much right on track with our startup curve that we expected, frankly, probably a little bit ahead of it. And we've had short periods of time when we ramp -- been able to ramp-up for short periods of time to about 90% to 95% of capacity. So all of that gives us a good deal of confidence in the plant technology and in our teammates' ability to run that plant efficiently and effectively.","Luke Folta - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. I guess, secondly, I mean, it sounds like the experience so far has been really good. Have you gotten any closer to deciding when you might make the decision on the third DRI plant?","John J. Ferriola","Well, you know, I'll say we've gotten a little -- first of all, it would be the second one in Louisiana, our third one in the company, just so we're clear on that. And certainly, we are looking at that. I don't want to say that we're any closer to making that decision. We're just a couple of weeks into the startup. We want to continue to evaluate the HYL technology, although we've been very impressed with it to date. And frankly, as with any plant, we went through this with our facility in Trinidad, during that first year of operation, there's going to be some bumps in the road. And we expect it, you should expect it. It won't come as any surprise to us when it happens. We're confident in our ability to overcome those bumps and continue to move forward. But there are going to be -- there's going to be hiccups in the operation. It's just it's a new facility, a complex operation and there will be some hiccups. So we're continuing to evaluate it, we'll make the decision on the second DRI facility in Louisiana at the appropriate time.","Luke Folta - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, if I could. On the natural gas drilling partnership, is there an approximate range in terms of what price nat gas has to get to before you think it's worth starting to ramp-up drilling there?","John J. Ferriola","Well, I'll repeat what we said in the script. At last year's pricing, we were able to have a modest profitable return. And so that should give you some indication. I'm not going to go any further than that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll next go to Matt Murphy with UBS.","Matt Murphy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe just continuing on the nat gas. How did the decision process work going forward? Is this something you kind of evaluate year-to-year or you need to see the futures curve move to get more -- say, get back to talking about drilling?","John J. Ferriola","Well, as I mentioned, it's something that we'll do jointly with our partners, Encana. I'm not sure that it would be dependent upon the futures curve, as such, per se. But obviously, we would be looking for a sustainable price movement before we would make a decision to begin drilling again. Right now, we believe it's in the best interest of our shareholders and the best return for our capital to suspend the drilling. The key here is to remember that we don't lose any of the gas that's still underground. It'll always be there and we have the same amount of access to it. So as pricing increases, it only gets better. So we'll look at it with a very careful eye before we begin drilling again. We would want to see a sustainable price move in natural gas so that we get a higher return for our investment. It's just common sense. We have nothing to lose and a lot to gain, and that's how we'll approach it.","Matt Murphy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. Okay. I guess the other question on it would be, given it was modestly profitable in 2013, would you still be needing to disclose it as a separate segment or does that get put off until it becomes more meaningful?","James D. Frias","This is Jim Frias, I'll answer that. At 300-and-some wells that we'll have in process, with what's going to be finished drilling through about the middle of this year, that's not enough at that point to require the separate disclosures, it's not material enough. So it's going to be at some point in time, we don't have a specific number of wells that have to be out there producing that crosses over that line. But we're not really anywhere near it with the 300-plus -- small amount that we'll have in 2014.","John J. Ferriola","I would just like to make one more point about the suspension of the drilling. I mentioned it in the script, but it's really a very significant point. And that is that we have covered our needs for the DRI plant in Louisiana. So the -- our desire to hedge our bets on natural gas, which would mean a major risk to our DRI facility, we've got that covered. So we've got that covered right now into 2015. So that would also factor into our decision. As we saw a need to continue or to grow the hedge in Louisiana, that would be a factor we would use in deciding to begin drilling again.","Operator","Our next question is from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So not to go over this $400 million, but when we saw the announcement our first thought was, what's the other better use of that $400 million that you contemplate? Since the CapEx does fall substantially, what kind of other investments or alternatives do you have in mind?","John J. Ferriola","Well, frankly, with the state of the economy and with the challenging market conditions in steel, we've been approached with more opportunities in the last 6 months than we have been in quite a while. I'm not going to state anything specific about where they are or what they are, but there's opportunities out there. Now having said that, that doesn't mean just because we have it, we're going to go out and spend it. If it's not an opportunity that provides a great return on that investment, we're not going to move forward with it. Bear in mind what I mentioned during the last call, and I want to reiterate right now. Our focus is on execution. We've invested $8 billion of our shareholders' valuable capital over the last -- well, since 2008. And our focus this year is going to be on execution. Having said that, if the right opportunity comes along, whether or not we were able to conserve the $400 million on the gas or not, if the right opportunity came along, our financial strength and our balance sheet position would allow us to take advantage of it. But again, it's got to be the right opportunity with the right return on the investment of our shareholders' valuable capital. Other than that, our focus will be on execute -- continuing to focus on being the low-cost producer, driving our costs down and moving up the value chain in our product offerings.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So we'll just leave that teaser of the lot of opportunities, I guess. That's interesting. I really wanted to probe a little bit more on the guidance, given that you did talk about all of the outages and all the different projects that you kind of finished up in the fourth quarter. I thought most steel mills make the bulk of their money in the first half of the year for the construction season. And so I'm a little bit confused as to how bad the weather you're contemplating would be to offset some of those normal positives and the switch from outages to normal operations?","John J. Ferriola","Well, we're not very effective predictors of the weather, okay. So let me start by saying that. But given the start of the year and the way that it is looking for at least the first quarter, we think there's going to be some whether challenges out there for the next 3 months. And also bear in mind that when we talk about the impact of weather on our business, it's not just the downstream. We always tend to focus on the downstream businesses that are impacted. But remember, we're a fully-integrated company. So when our downstream businesses are impacted, it impacts our steel production. It impacts our scrap operations, our whole raw material chain. So weather, for us, can have an impact on our profitability. And frankly, Timna, we don't know what the weather is going to be. But given our best guess, that's how we see it at this point in time. We'll come back, as we always do, in the middle of the last month of the quarter and give more direct guidance.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If I could, a final piece. On DRI, is it too soon to see the benefit because you're still working down some other inventory, like pig iron that you might have had to have in place as a cushion in case DRI didn't start on time?","John J. Ferriola","Absolutely. That's part of the factor. And again, and I want to be very upfront about this, we're a couple of weeks into production at our Louisiana facility. And we know that during the course of the next 6 to 12 months, there are going to be some bumps in the road, some hiccups in our production. And so we'll factor some of that in. We will have -- we'll keep a little bit more on hand to protect against some of those occurrences that we know are out there. We just haven't found them yet. Having said that, I want to reiterate that we have full confidence in our team in Louisiana. They will overcome those road bumps and continue to bring it online and exceed our expectations, I'm sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a first question on rebar. We've seen quite a surge in import licenses in January so far. And I know we had critical circumstances kind of floating out there. I was wondering if you could just walk us through the timing of how critical circumstances affects behavior? What you're seeing in your business? Should we expect some sort of big drop-off in inventories in the near-term -- sorry, imports in the near-term here?","John J. Ferriola","Well, as I mentioned, we are working hard with our government to make sure that, that in fact happens. There's no doubt in my mind and in our minds that rebar is being imported and dumped into the United States. It's a really good sign when you get the kind of vote in the preliminary hearing that we were able to get. If I recall, I believe it was 5 to 1, which is outstanding. The ruling is expected on -- towards the end of April. I think it's April 28, is when we'll have the final hearing and the ruling. So we're confident that at this point, we'll get a favorable ruling. We believe that to be the case. And we believe very strongly that it should be the case of critical circumstances and all of the penalties that come along with that. We'll be pushing hard for that. And we've got a great team in Washington, a great team -- government affairs here in Charlotte supporting that team. And we're confident it's going to happen.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And maybe just one on currency. We've seen, obviously, some pretty serious depreciation in a lot of the scrap-consuming countries since the beginning of the year, particularly Turkey. How do you see that impacting the scrap business going forward? And maybe more than that, how do you see it impacting steel in general, and perhaps even DRI?","John J. Ferriola","Well, Keith, do you want to comment on scrap? I do note that we have seen that occur in currency. It's been interesting to see though the amount of exported scrap going to Turkey. It seems to have dropped off in the last couple of weeks.","Keith B. Grass","Yes. Well, certainly, with their currency dropping off, we've seen less activity on the coast. So in terms of how it will impact the scrap market, moving forward, the scrap market will continue to be regional and based on grades, but we're starting to see, certainly, cold weather in one part of the country and less demand from an export standpoint on the East Coast, and that scrap is starting to become a little bit more available to consumers here in the United States. So to answer, maybe, 2 questions. One is, we probably see a little bit of softening in the scrap market as a result of reduced export activity and the recent run-up in scrap prices seems to be satisfying some demand.","John J. Ferriola","And in terms of addressing the steel side, and we're going to watch that situation very carefully. And if we see an increase in the imports of steel products from Turkey that result from that, we'll take the appropriate action.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to touch base on an earlier question in terms of how much capability, unused capability you really have or earnings power you have with some of the investments that you've made over the years,, and the construction market being very weak compared to what it was at its peak, say. I know it's improving modestly, but how much earnings capability, if you had a decent construction market in the U.S., you think Nucor has with the build up in terms of capital investment and the acquisitions you've made over the years?","John J. Ferriola","Substantial. You need more clarification than that?","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sure.","John J. Ferriola","Obviously, there's a lot of factors and too many factors to be able to give you a hard and fast number. Again, I'm just going to repeat what I've said. We've made the investments. We've made them to improve not only our volume capabilities, but the value-added product capabilities we can offer to the marketplace. We stand ready and poised to take advantage of the upcycle that's inevitably going to arrive. How quickly it arrives, how quickly the economy and the market ramps up will determine the kind of returns that we see on this investment. Will we see them? Absolutely. When we see them is what's a little bit up in the air and is dependent upon how quickly the economy and the market recovers.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One of your competitors this morning on their call mentioned that in terms of non-res construction, the joist business, they're doing fairly well. The big-box type of builders, really, consuming, pushing up the joist numbers. Are you seeing anything on the non-res construction side other than the joist activity?","John J. Ferriola","Well, we've seen an increase in our backlogs. We've seen a modest improvement in the pricing that we've been able to -- pricing power we've been able to exercise in those areas. But again, it's been a modest improvement. We -- just as we began to see things improve, we saw the weather get a lot worse, and that's impacted some of that. But we believe that there will be an incremental improvement in the nonresidential construction market during 2014. How quickly it ramps up is unclear. But if you read all the projections, we here -- we read there's anywhere from -- some of the projections are 5% to 10% improvement in 2014 over 2013. So we think that that's probably a reasonable number.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And the last question, just in terms of the sheet business...","R. Joseph Stratman","Michael, I'm sorry to interrupt. This is Joe Stratman. Let me also add, I think you asked the question if we've seen it in any other area than joist. We have seen it in backlogs in our structural business as well. We've ended the year with stronger backlog than we've had in quite a while, which is indicative -- all of that goes into nonresidential construction. And the other comment I'll add to that, it's a good balance geographically and by sector of the types of projects we're seeing. So that's a good sign.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One last question, on the sheet side. How much unused capability do you have on your sheet mills right now?","John J. Ferriola","We're running probably somewhere around the neighborhood of about 80% -- 75% to 80% capacity utilization. It goes up and down a little bit. Now one of the things that we've been a little bit encouraged by is the fact that we have seen some increase in our order book in sheet, particularly in cold-rolled and in galvanized. The hot-rolled market has been a little bit more challenged, but cold-rolled and galvanized, partially being driven by automotive, as well as our heavy machinery, are doing very well.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Do see some opportunities in sheet to pick up some share, given the anticipation you have for scrap pricing or your costs to come down?","John J. Ferriola","We always look for those opportunities. I would say its a combination of those factors, and probably more significantly, the fact that we have a broader offering to the marketplace now. The 72-inch products coming off of Berkeley, that's a big -- we will be able to attack different markets with that. Now we still have a -- balancing against that is there's still overcapacity in the world, and it's coming into the United States in the way of imports. Will we gain market share? We believe we will. It's a factor of new products we can offer, but it's also a factor of our performance. Our quality is outstanding. Our on-time delivery is second to none, and our service that we provide to our customers is excellent. In fact, you've heard me mention several times in our past calls our focus on commercial excellence. And I find it kind of rewarding, to be honest with you, that in listening to some of the other calls from our competitors, the term commercial excellence seems to be coming up more from our competitors today. And I guess I'll just say, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery when I think about that.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Yu with Citi.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Congrats on the startup of the DRI. I know it's been a long time in the works. My question is kind of along those lines. So even now that you're having improving success, would you be in a position to help either provide us with the range or guide our thinking in terms of dollar per ton savings you would expect, maybe in the context of Brazilian pig iron at $385 and you've got the pile decks at $125. Just how should we think about the dollar per ton savings?","John J. Ferriola","Well, Brian, to help everyone understand, and we do post a kind of a spreadsheet on our website, and you can go on to that website and work through the numbers based upon your best projection on iron ore cost, iron scrap cost, pig iron cost and all of the rest. So -- now I'll leave that to you to go through it. I'll just answer your question by saying, we're just -- again, we're a couple of weeks into this process. We're just going through the startup now. We're still evaluating what it's going to mean to us. It will change as the pricing of other iron units changes. We've said that many times. In environments where you have a high iron unit pricing, it's going to be a very, very major contributor. In times, in environments where iron costs, iron unit costs are lower, it will be a positive contributor of a lesser amount. So it's a function of many inputs, you're welcome to go on to the website and work through the numbers. You can see them at different levels.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like costs are tracking what you would expect thus far?","John J. Ferriola","I'm sorry, what?","James D. Frias","Cost are tracking [indiscernible]...","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","[indiscernible] tracking cost, yes.","John J. Ferriola","Yes. Our production costs are tracking what we would expect to date.","Operator","Your next question is from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I had a question on your SBQ initiatives as far as new capabilities being brought online, and then just also how your backlogs in that business are progressing as we enter the new year here?","John J. Ferriola","Okay. Well, we kind of gave you a quick update in the script. Jim Darsey heads up our bar mills. Jim, want to give an update?","James R. Darsey","Okay. Thank you, John. In 2013, our SBQ shipments were up 18% compared to 2012. We're entering 2014 with a solid backlog and we've continued to make progress with the startup of our equipment, particularly at Nucor Steel Nebraska, with the new finishing equipment that improves our quality and packaging. And Memphis has continued to make progress. We just completed the installation and startup of a state-of-the-art offline quality assurance line that will enable us, as John mentioned in the script, will enable us to produce and inspect bar for the most demanding engineered bar applications. And this fits right in with our strategy to grow our SBQ business into the automotive, into the forging industry, into the construction industry, heavy equipment, heavy truck industry and agriculture industry. And we continue to make steady and measured progress in those industries.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that. And I've got a follow-up on DRI, and I know you've already answered pieces, parts to this, John. But any sense of magnitude you can give us as far as the startup costs in the fourth quarter. And then I know, looking forward, you said you're going to have reduced startup costs in the first quarter, but getting to a level where you're comfortable, I know you said ups and downs, but comfortable with the profitability and the potential of the assets, when should we be thinking about that sort of contribution?","James D. Frias","Well, first, just to pre-operating and startup costs. In the fourth quarter, they were about $16 million and we're expecting them to be lower by about $10 million in the first quarter. And the improvement is largely improvement at Nucor Louisiana, the DRI facility, that's where the improvement is coming from. And I'll let John speak further about what we expect from that point going through the rest of the year.","John J. Ferriola","As I've mentioned several times on the call, we're early in the process. So it's hard for me to give too much color to how we're going to play out during the rest of the year. We're confident in this technology, the initial results are outstanding. Our quality is good, our volume is good, the process is stable. Having said all of that, there will be bumps in the road, as I've mentioned. We're expecting them, we're confident we will overcome them. But it makes it very difficult for me to give any kind of projection at this point on the returns. We'll be better prepared to answer that as we get a little bit further down the road with operating that facility.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Lane with Morningstar.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Along the lines of your comment that imitation is the finest form of flattery, some your peers have discussed an interest in DRI production. So I'm curious, over time, do think they'll be able to replicate the cost advantage you appear to have established via in-house, low-cost DRI production? And if not, what factors will allow you to sustain that competitive advantage?","John J. Ferriola","Well, one of the major factors, obviously, one of the largest costs of DRI production, second to iron ore, is natural gas. And our natural gas working partnership agreement is a major factor for us being able to maintain a very competitive position in the production of DRI. I would also point out to you that we have a lot of facilities that can use the DRI. When you build a DRI plant, if you plan to consume it yourself, it's got to be across a multitude of facilities. There's an investment required at each one of those facilities in heating the material into the furnace, the equipment required to do that. We're in a position where we have the balance sheet to have been able to do that, and do it in the right manner so that we can feed a significant amount of DRI into the furnaces to get the kind of results we are looking to get. So for those reasons, we believe that we -- and frankly, having gotten a head start, it's -- the best way to learn about a process is to work with the equipment. We've been working with it now for a while. We'll continue to work with it. In some way -- if a competitor was to move forward with plans in DRI production, right now, it would take them probably a minimum of 2 to 3 years by the time they gathered all of the permits and went through the ordering of equipment and the construction phase of it. I'm sure they would hit a couple of the bumps that we hit, that would slow them down a bit. So we think we would have a 2- to 3-year time advantage, and with that comes a lot of knowledge and a lot of experience that we think would give us a competitive advantage. So we believe that the way we went into this and being first into it and going into it in a big way as we have done, is going to give us a long-term ability to have a competitive position.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. And then a follow-up. How do your DRI production costs in Louisiana compare to your DRI production costs in Trinidad on a per-ton basis? And do you anticipate the spread between the 2 to change over time?","John J. Ferriola","Well, again, different factors there that will impact the overall costs. But let me just say this, what you really have to compare is the conversion cost itself, okay. And we think that Louisiana, given the size of the -- and we have an advantage of volume and the technology itself, we think is a little bit better technology. We think we'll be in at least a cost-competitive, if not cost-advantaged position in Louisiana.","Operator","We'll take our next question with David Lipschitz with CLSA.","David A. Lipschitz - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Quick question on the sheet products. Where do we stand on lead times? Where are you out to right now?","John J. Ferriola","Well, let's go by product.","James D. Frias","He said sheet. He wants sheet.","John J. Ferriola","Yes. I was going to go by hot-rolled, cold-rolled, or galvanized, Okay. So on hot-rolled, David, we're out to late February, and cold-rolled and galvanized we're well into April. Is that what you were looking for, David?","David A. Lipschitz - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Exactly what I was looking for.","Operator","The last question is from Ignace Proot with Sanford Bernstein.","Ignace F. Proot - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I have 2 questions. One question is related to your shipments of the fourth quarter, which were actually quite good. They were still above the Q1 to Q2 shipments, which is in contrast to a difficult seasonal effect. I was wondering is this driven by fundamental demand that was there or is this still a bit a market share change that we had throughout the year, given some incidents at competitors. And if it was a market share shift, what part of that could stick? That's the first question. And the second question, going back to DRI. In the environment where still many iron ore producers cannot produce the DRI-grade and several steel makers having more interest in actually buying more, how do you look at the DRI premium, the pellet premium?","John J. Ferriola","Okay. Let me begin with your first question and we'll work into the second question. Maybe I'll address the second question first, while it's fresh in my mind. You gave me a bunch of questions there at one time. So lets start with DRI, it's true that the demand for the pellet is improving, is increasing. But we have multiple sources of the iron ore itself. And in our arrangements with those, we feel confident that we'll be able to get the iron ore pelletized the way[ph] to a DRI level that we need. And we don't see this as a major obstacle going forward. Perhaps you can refresh my memory on all the 2 parts of the first question. Okay. Your question was with our shipments in the fourth quarter...","Ignace F. Proot - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes. So the question is really your shipments in the fourth quarter were still very good. And I was wondering is that still fundamental demands or is it still a bit of the volumes that you took over from some competitors, given some incidents that happened in the third quarter? And if so, do you think a part of that market share shift could stick?","John J. Ferriola","Okay. First of all, certainly, there was a small amount of demand improvement in the fourth quarter. So there certainly was some demand improvement. But we also had a huge opportunity because of some challenges that some of our competitors faced in their production facilities. And that gave us an opportunity to grow our market share. And whenever you have that opportunity, you work hard to keep it going forward. You work hard to keep it going forward through your performance. We know that we serve those customers well. When some of our competitors, because of various situations, let their customers down, we were able to move in quickly, supply high-quality product, on-time, great service, a phenomenal performance, all at a very reasonable price. And we believe that as a result of that and as a result of the new products that we've been introducing to the market, we did pick up market share and we will be able to hold a portion of that market share going forward.","Operator","That's all the time we have for questions today. I would now turn the call back over to Mr. John Ferriola for closing remarks.","John J. Ferriola","Thank you, Jamie. And let me just wrap up by saying thank you to our shareholders. We appreciate your confidence and your support. Thank you to our customers. We really do appreciate your business. And I want to say thank you to my Nucor teammates for creating value for our customers, generating attractive returns for our shareholders and building a sustainable future for all of us.

Please go ahead, sir.","John J. Ferriola","Good afternoon. This is John Ferriola, Nucor's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team: Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman, Chad Utermark and Dave Sumoski, the newest member of our leadership team. In September, Keith Grass, Nucor's Executive Vice President responsible for our raw material businesses, retired. Keith joined the David J. Joseph Company in 1978. He has served as DJJ's CEO since 2000 and became an Executive Vice President of Nucor when the Joseph Company joined the Nucor family in 2008.","Keith's strong leadership has contributed greatly to the establishment of DJJ as North America's premiere metals recycler and the successful implementation of Nucor's raw materials strategy. On behalf of the entire Nucor family, I want to thank Keith Grass for his many contributions to the combined success of David J. Joseph and Nucor. Keith, you have retired, but you will always be part of the Nucor family.","Upon Keith's retirement, Nucor Executive Vice President, Joe Stratman, has assumed responsibility for our raw materials and logistics businesses. Joe has served as an Executive Vice President of Nucor since 2007. As noted earlier, Dave Sumoski became Nucor's newest Executive Vice President in September with responsibility for our engineered bar products business. Dave is a 19-year veteran of our company and a proven leader who will be a strong addition to our executive management team.","Since 2012, he has served as General Manager of Nucor Steel Memphis. Dave's promotion will enable us to intensify our focus on a highly attractive growth business for Nucor. In recent years, we have invested approximately $290 million to expand our special bar quality, cold finish bar and wire rod product offerings. Dave and his team are well prepared to continue Nucor's highly successful record of profitable growth in engineered bar products.","The executive -- the entire executive management team would like to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit, Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for a job extremely well done in the third quarter. You worked hard, you worked together, and most importantly, you worked safely to deliver strong earnings growth over both this year's second quarter and last year's third quarter.","This growth was achieved despite continuing serious challenges in the U.S. and global steel markets. Our more than 22,000 teammates are doing an outstanding job executing Nucor's strategy for profitable growth. In recent years, our team has invested significant capital in a large number of projects to improve our cost structure and expand our product portfolios to include more value-added, higher-margined offerings. We are now just beginning to see some of the early benefits on these strategic investments. As steel markets and non-residential construction continue improving in the years ahead, we expect the returns will grow dramatically.","We also want to extend a very warm welcome to the newest members of the Nucor family: our team at Nucor Steel Gallatin in Ghent, Kentucky. Nucor is very proud and excited to have you on board. Nucor's employees, the right people, are our company's greatest asset and our greatest competitive advantage. Keep up the outstanding work you have always done with a focus on safety, quality and productivity. Together, we have a great future taking care of all of our customers, the people who use our products, our teammates and our shareholders.","I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to review Nucor's third quarter performance and financial position. Following Jim's comments, I will update you on the progress implementing our strategy for long-term profitable growth. Jim?","James D. Frias","Thanks, John. Third quarter of 2014 earnings of $0.76 per diluted share compares favorably with our guidance range of $0.70 to $0.75 per diluted share. It also represents a strong 65% improvement from earnings of $0.46 per share, per diluted share, reported in both the second quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2013.","A comment about our tax rates, which can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting out profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was 34.6% for the third quarter of 2014.","Results from our steel mills and steel product segments were significantly improved in third quarter of 2014, particularly improved profitability was achieved by our sheet plate and joist and decking businesses. The third quarter performance of our raw materials segment included a larger-than-expected operating loss of approximately $0.09 per diluted share at our new direct reduced iron, or DRI, plant in Louisiana. Nucor's overall third quarter performance again demonstrates the value of one of our key competitive strengths. We are North America's most diversified producer of steel and steel products.","Our sheet mills did an excellent job of capitalizing on pricing strength in flat-rolled markets this past quarter, but our robust earnings growth was also driven by increased contributions from a number of other product lines. Our plate mill group is benefiting from the investments made during the downturn to expand our value-added product capabilities with the addition of heat treating, normalizing and vacuum tank degassing. All 3 of our fabricated construction products, joist and decking, preengineered metal buildings and rebar fabrication delivered significant earnings improvements in this year's third quarter and the first 9 months. At the same time, we continue to enjoy healthy earnings contributions from our bar mills, cold finish B mills and raw materials brokerage businesses.","David J. Joseph Company's scrap processing business has also achieved improved profitability over this period. As John mentioned, the entire Nucor team is working hard to deliver attractive returns on the capital we have invested during the downturn. Our investments totaled nearly $6 billion over 2009 through 2014 period, with about 2\/3 going to capital expenditures and 1\/3 going to acquisitions.","We believe the robust 59% increase in earnings year-over-year through the first 9 months of 2014 is strong evidence that these efforts are beginning to pay off for our shareholders. Most importantly, we believe that this is only an early indication of greater earnings power to come as continued recovery in nonresidential construction gains momentum.","On October 8, we completed our purchase of all the equity of Gallatin Steel for a cash purchase price of approximately $770 million. The acquisition was funded from cash on hand and the issuance of approximately $300 million of commercial paper. Drawing from Nucor's strong generation of cash from operations, we expect to retire our commercial paper borrowings within the next 12 months. Our team is excited about the opportunities the Gallatin acquisition provides Nucor to create attractive long-term value for our shareholders, customers and employees.","Adjusting for the next -- for the net present value of the anticipated tax benefits, the realized effective purchase price is approximately $630 million. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to cash flow and accretive to earnings after working through purchase accounting value to finished goods inventories. Due to Gallatin's 4-week inventory turnover rate, we would expect purchase accounting expenses, net of operating profits, to result in a negligible impact to the fourth quarter of 2014 results. John Ferriola will discuss in his comments the compelling strategic value Gallatin provides Nucor. The Gallatin transaction highlights the strategic value of our company's financial strength.","Nucor is the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating. Our strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow generation through the economic cycle allow Nucor to make strategic acquisitions when the right assets at the right price become available in the marketplace.","Our cash and short-term investments totaled $1.4 billion at the end of the third quarter. Following the purchase of Gallatin, after the close of the quarter, cash and short-term investments remain well above our targeted minimum level of $500 million. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. This facility does not mature until August of 2018.","Our next significant debt maturity is not until 2017, including the recently issued commercial paper of Nucor's pro forma gross debt-to-capital ratio is approximately 37%. We continue to estimate our 2014 capital spending will be approximately $600 million. That would be a significant decline from capital expenditures that exceeded $1 billion in both 2013 and 2012. Most of our recent large-scale growth projects have been completed or are nearing completion. Also, the temporary suspension of drilling new wells by our natural gas working interest investment is reducing Nucor's 2014 capital spending by about $400 million.","We recently reached a joint decision with Encana, our working interest investment partner, to extend our drilling suspension through the end of 2015, other than drilling several wells required to maintain leasehold rights. Nucor's strong relationship with Encana gives both partners a win-win approach to deploying capital in the current natural gas price environment. We, together, retain the valuable option to resume drilling in a higher natural gas pricing environment where more attractive returns are generated. Nucor also maintains our desired hedge on gas consumption for decades into the future. It is important to note that our Louisiana DRI plant's expected gas usage in 2015 and 2016 is covered by production from our existing wells, plus financial hedges we have recently secured.","Nucor's capital spending plans for 2015 will not be set until later this quarter. With no new major projects currently anticipated, we would expect next year's capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million. That would compare against a preliminary estimate of 2015 depreciation and amortization of approximately $700 million.","Nucor Steel Gallatin is expected to account for approximately $40 million of that estimated total depreciation and amortization expense for next year. Fourth quarter 2014 earnings are expected to show a moderate decline from strong third quarter earnings due to typical seasonal factors, but should be well above 2013 fourth quarter earnings of $0.53 per diluted share. Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance in the final month of the quarter.","The biggest risk to our outlook for our industry continues to be excess global steel capacity that has resulted in large quantities of steel illegally dumped into the United States. Nucor and other steel producers in the U.S. are working hard to bring attention to the need for free and fair trade, which is simply rules-based trade as established by the World Trade Organization or WTO. We applaud several recent actions by the U.S. government to enforce our nation's trade laws. Last week, the U.S. Department of Commerce notified the Russian government that it is terminating the suspension agreement for hot-rolled sheet steel imports. Russian hot-rolled sheet imports have surged by more than 2,500% or 25x in the first 9 months of 2014. The suspension agreement will be replaced by an anti-dumping duty order, which we expect to be more effective.","Earlier this month, the U.S. International Trade Commission, in a unanimous 6-0 vote, ruled that the domestic rebar industry is materially injured as a result of dumped and subsidized rebar imports from Turkey and Mexico. In August, the ITC found that domestic oil country tubular goods, or OCTG, producers were materially damaged by dumped and subsidized imports of OCTG from South Korea and 5 other countries, and duties have been assessed by the Commerce Department.","Nucor is the market leader in serving these highly valued customers in the pipe and tube industry. In July, the Commerce Department issued positive preliminary determinations on dumping duties against wire rod imports from China. While we are encouraged by these several rulings, we realize that more work remains in a fight for effective and timely enforcement of rules-based trade. Supporting our mission is the indisputable fact that our domestic industry is among the lowest-cost producers of steel in the world. As always, our team will remain focused on executing our strategies for profitable long-term growth in whatever economic and steel industry conditions we face.","We appreciate your interest in our company. John?","John J. Ferriola","Thanks, Jim. During the third quarter, our team stayed focused on what is under our control today. I'm very encouraged by our performance in the just-completed quarter and first 9 months of 2014. Nucor delivered solid earnings growth in what are still very challenging steel market conditions.","First and foremost, each day, we pursue continual improvement in the job we do, taking care of all of Nucor's customers. At the same time, our team continues to aggressively implement our strategy of investing for long-term profitable growth. I will now update you on our recent achievements.","Our targeted acquisition of Gallatin Steel is a significant step forward in building a long-term earnings power of our sheet mill group and Nucor overall. Here are some of the key strategic benefits. Nucor -- excuse me, Gallatin enhances Nucor's leadership position in the flat-rolled hot band products market. Gallatin strengthens Nucor's capabilities to serve the flat-rolled customers in the growing pipe and tube industry. Gallatin broadens our footprint in the Midwest region, which is the largest flat-rolled consuming market in the United States. Gallatin's location on the Ohio River strongly complements our raw materials strategy as it is well positioned to receive DRI from our Louisiana facility. Gallatin represents Nucor's fourth sheet mill located on the U.S. river system, broadening our commercial reach and access to our materials. Gallatin's annual capacity of approximately 1.8 million tons increases our hot-rolled sheet steel capacity by 16% to more than 13 million tons. Gallatin also fits well with Nucor's footprint of downstream businesses that consume and process flat-rolled steel.","Finally, Gallatin provides a number of future strategic growth options for Nucor. Most importantly, we share a strong cultural compatibility with our new teammates at Nucor Steel Gallatin. Particularly significant is the common, unrelenting focus on safety, quality and productivity. We are very excited about the many opportunities ahead for profitable growth with having the Gallatin team join the Nucor family.","In the fourth quarter, our Nucor-Yamato structural steel mill will begin prime production of its new sheet piling sections. Results from the production trials completed in the third quarter were very positive. This $115 million project expands our product offerings to include new, wider piling sections that are lighter and stronger, covering more area at a lower installed cost.","This investment strengthens our market position in the piling business. It also allows us to realize more synergies from our strategic 2012 acquisition of piling distributor, Skyline Steel.","Our Nucor Steel Berkeley sheet mill's successful start-up this year of its wide, light capital project continues to build momentum. During the third quarter, our Berkeley team produced new, wider products for several customers in the appliance and lawn and garden offerings. This $95 million investment provides Berkeley the capability to roll gauges as thin as 0.042 inches, which is the lightest hot-rolled gauge capability of any sheet mill in the Southern U.S. market. Berkeley's capabilities also provide a finished width of up to 72 inches. We estimate the size of the new market segment now available to Berkeley to be approximately 4 million tons annually.","During the third quarter, our new Louisiana DRI facility continued to work through equipment adjustments that will improve yield and conversion costs. There is no question that the start of this plant has been very challenging in the early going, but that's no different from what we experienced in starting off our first DRI plant, which is located in Trinidad. What has been different with the Louisiana start-up has been the additional burden of today's low raw material pricing environment. However, a significant positive achievement in the start-up this year at Nucor Steel Louisiana is the outstanding quality achieved by our team. As we have discussed in previous calls, Louisiana has set new world-class quality standards for DRI with metallization rates of 96% and carbon content exceeding 4%.","That's why our flat-rolled and SBQ steel mills are eager to consume as much of Louisiana's output as they can get. As a result of our cumulative learning curve advances and resulting equipment adjustments, we expect to realize significant improvement in the financial performance of the Louisiana DRI plant by the end of this year. It also remains our view that our expanded DRI capacity, combined with our natural gas investments, uniquely positions Nucor for profitable long-term growth in the higher value-added sheet, plate and SBQ markets.","Recent significant declines in iron ore pricing, accompanied by relatively more stable scrap pricing, currently supports our confidence in the value of Nucor's DRI-based raw materials strategy. We are very encouraged by the Nucor team's progress in the third quarter, but we are never satisfied. That is why the more than 22,000 men and women of Nucor remain strongly focused on execution and delivering strong returns on the valuable capital entrusted to us by our shareholders. As has been true throughout Nucor's history, our company's best years are still ahead of us.","Thank you for your interest in Nucor and sharing your valuable time with us this afternoon. We would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So first question is on the trade case, specifically the potential trade case, I should say, on cold-rolled products and some coated sheet products that we keep hearing about. Kind of the latest I've heard is that there may be some disagreements amongst some of the mills that are involved in the case about the breadth of the case, and that may be delaying it. And I'm just hoping you guys could kind of give us an update and let us know what could debottleneck that process?","John J. Ferriola","Well, I can't speak to others' opinions on this history, but I can share with you Nucor's opinion. When you look at the increase in cold-rolled imports this year, they've increased by about 100%; galv has increased almost 50% year-over-year. As I mentioned to you on the last time on the last conference call, I have been spending a lot of time in Washington, and I've gained more confidence in our elected leaders' ability to connect the dots between the illegally traded products and the slow recovery in the economy. That said, specific to your question, we are working with our trade attorneys in Washington to collect the data that we're going to need to file the case at the appropriate time. We are confident in our ability to present a good case, and we will present that case aggressively, and we will aggressively pursue critical circumstances with the associated retroactive penalties.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then maybe just one question on DRI. How do you, when you report losses, how do you factor in the revenue? Are you basing that off of a discount to pig iron price? Or is it more based on some mix of scrap? How should we think about that?","John J. Ferriola","We price internally based off of pig iron with a value-in-use adjustment.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then one last question maybe on Gallatin. Have you got any chance to kind of go in there and see what commercial practices have been like? Is there any changes that you think you might want to make going forward?","John J. Ferriola","Well, we have just closed just a few weeks ago, so we haven't had a lot of time to go in and look at what they have been doing. What I can tell you is -- what I can speak to is what they will be doing more in the future, and that's working with our commercial team, as we always do, to present a single one-Nucor approach to the marketplace. We will follow our practice of not having any CRU or any index-minus pricing in the marketplace. And we will continue to provide a great value to our customers at a fair price. We're anxious to have them join our team. As I mentioned during my comments, it does give us a better presence in the Midwest. It supports our mill in Crawfordsville. It's on the water, and it's going to give us ability to reach into the Southeast market as well as the Midwest market. And we have a very strong position today in the growing pipe and tube market, and this just enhances that. They have a great position in that also. We share some customers, but frankly, not many. So this is a great chance for us to expand our geographical reach, to expand our product breadth, and frankly, to expand our customer base.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Yu with Citi.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jim, I wanted to ask you a question about your comment earlier about the U.S. steel-making cost advantage. As you know, the domestic scrap prices are about flat, while in the international markets, Turkey scrap import cost is down $50. China is down $100, and then the drop in iron ore and met coal translates to about $100 per ton drop for blast furnace costs. How do you see this playing out, either from a market standpoint or actions that Nucor can take to try to narrow some of the gap?","John J. Ferriola","Okay, well, let me -- I'll give Jim a chance to add any comments that he wants at the end, but I will -- let me start by making a couple of comments. First of all, as you mentioned, because of the lower-priced scrap in areas like Turkey and all those places, the United States will not -- and combined with the higher dollar value, the United States will not be exporting more scrap at all to those regions, which will give us a bit of an excess of scrap here in the United States, which should help our scrap pricing of our product. But bear in mind that scrap, although it's a significant input cost, it's one of many input costs, particularly in electric arc furnaces where scrap is consumed. Electrical energy, it's a very large cost, and we have a significant cost advantage here in the United States compared to those regions that you mentioned. Natural gas could be another example where we have an energy benefit. As I've mentioned a couple of times in the past, one of the greatest benefits we have is the productivity and the ingenuity of the American worker. And here at Nucor, we have the added benefit of the DRI, which, in fact, benefits from the lower iron ore pricing that you mentioned in other regions of the country. When you think about how iron ore and scrap has behaved over the last year, it's kind of an interesting situation. Iron ore pricing is down about 42%. Scrap pricing is down about 14% so far this year. So that kind of points to the benefit. With those kind of numbers, it pays to be able to have an input into your furnaces that's based on iron ore pricing such as our DRI. And I would also point out that, that's the way it is today, but that reverses. It has reversed in the past; it will reverse again in the future, which again points to one of the great strengths of our DRI strategy and our overall raw materials strategy by having both the DJ Joseph as part of the Nucor family and the ability to produce 4.5 million tons of DRI. We have the flexibility to flip back our product -- our scrap mix if that relationship between scrap and iron ore does reverse. So kind of a long-winded answer to your question, certainly, we are cognizant of the situation with iron ore pricing and scrap pricing in countries that we compete with. As long as they continue to play fair, we feel confident because of the reasons that I've mentioned, that we will compete successfully against them. We say it all the time, we can compete against any company in the world and do so well. It's more difficult when we have to compete against governments, and we will not allow that to happen.","James D. Frias","Let me just add one thing, John, and that is, Brian, when you think about this question, at any point in time there could be temporary inflection points where raw material costs, whether it's scrap or iron ore, move in different markets to different places but they eventually equalizes -- they eventually equalize and balance each other out. And so my comments about our -- the U.S. being a low-cost producer is not at this exact moment today compared to everybody; but just over time, if you look at the historical numbers, it's well-documented that the U.S. is one of the low-cost producers in the world.","John J. Ferriola","One more comment, if I may, on this. Obviously, you're leading to up to the point that, well, will all of this result in an even greater influx of imported steel into the United States? And certainly, we're keeping our eye on that situation. Jim's point about the raw material commodity eventually equalizing, well, the same happens with pricing the products. We'll monitor carefully what's happening with imports, and you'll see that gap that exists today in pricing begin to narrow. It'll narrow as a result of both the domestic price moderating and the foreign input price increasing. When you combine that with what's happening on some of the trade cases and the transportation issues that you see in the United States today once the product reaches a new port, all of that combined, we feel very confident that we can compete successfully despite the point that you made about the raw material costs in our competitive nations.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Good. That was a very comprehensive answer. And maybe I could just switch topics here, quickly. Just on the realized pricing side, you guys are getting -- the core-on-core increase in pricing is a bit better than what we've seen in the markets, and I was wondering if there's a way for you guys to help us understand what portion of that might be due to some of these value-add projects you put in place: wide and light and heat treat, normalizing plate? And then how much of it would be more markets related?","John J. Ferriola","I'm not sure that I could split -- spread that out, but I would -- but I'd make a few comments just to support the fact that it is a large portion of the value-added that we invested in.","James D. Frias","At least in the plate business.","John J. Ferriola","At least in the plate business. But I would also comment that it's more than just that. It's the value that we bring to our customers. It's the quality that we deliver. It's the service that we provide. It's the metallurgical support that I believe is the gold standard in the industry that we can give to our customers. And it's our focus on on-time delivery, which brings value. All of those items bring value to our customers.","James D. Frias","Brian, further to those points, I don't think we've really seen the benefits at all yet from the sheet piling project. And we've just started to see the benefits from the new lighter gauge sheet steel at Berkeley. We're seeing some benefit, but again we're early in the process of getting the full benefit of that project. We guess, in the SBQ side, we're probably about halfway towards achieving some of the benefits of the things we've done there, not so much in the volume, but more on in terms of the pricing value-add element. And of course, there's going to be a volume benefit coming as well. I think -- maybe, John, you could speak about the status of the caster upgrades at both Memphis and Nebraska.","John J. Ferriola","Well, we've completed both, okay. Memphis is finished and, of course, [ph] strand is completed. On the fifth strand in Nebraska, we're in the process of shutting down now to make the final installation. So they're moving along. We feel really good about when that was completed, all of the upgrades at Darlington. And we've got a little bit of tweaking to do, but basically we've completed that. So I would say that for the most part, by the end of the year, we will have completed virtually all of our SBQ modifications to add value. And let me just throw in one more point to Jim's comments, which were spot on. But bear in mind that the improvements that you're seeing in our performance, as Jim pointed out, we're just beginning to see the benefit of the investments that we're making. These -- all the improvements that you're seeing in our margins and our profitability are happening in a market that is still extremely challenged. We see this year, the marketplace in nonresidential construction having improved a little bit over last year, and we expect even further improvement next year. But when we see those markets return to the full strength that we know will inevitably be achieved, that's when you're going to see the full impact of these investments are bearing fruit for our company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Murphy with UBS.","Matthew Murphy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wondering if you could comment on what you're seeing in the structural market. I know you had a high year-over-year comparison, but only category where it was slightly weak year-over-year. Just wondering how you're seeing that market.","John J. Ferriola","The structural market has always been a good market for us. It's holding pretty steady. We've seen it pick up a little bit this year. We expect next year to also be a little bit better in the structural market as we see the continued improvements in nonresidential construction. I would also tell you that we're really excited about, again, just the beginnings of what we see from our piling project. We expect a good benefit from that. In terms of this year's performance relative -- you asked about why we seem to have been a little bit off last year's performance. It's a result of all those shutdowns that we had at NYS, installing the wider piling project that we've mentioned several times.","Matthew Murphy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So still some pickup from the shutdown. Okay, got it. And Jim, just on SG&A at $153 million this quarter, was there anything in particular driving that up?","James D. Frias","Well, we have a highly variable compensation system, profit-sharing system. So when profits go up, our profit-sharing expense goes up. 10% of pretax is how we fund our employees' retirement accounts.","And of course, the other thing that went through there was the charge that we'd noted before on the write-off of assets. It was $0.03 per share.","Operator","Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","We're starting to hear a lot more enthusiasm over non-res and I thought you might have sounded a little bit more chipper on the topic. So I guess I wanted to dive into that a little bit more and ask you about long products in general. Specifically, can you hold onto margins? Scrap prices are definitely falling. You guys are importing it, and so that can help offset some other weakness. But just wondering if margins on long products might be holding up better if non-res is recovering.","John J. Ferriola","Well, we think that -- and this is our opinion and also the opinion of the experts that go out and give these kind of estimates. We think this year -- by the end of this year relative compared to last year, you'll see somewhere around a 7% or 8% improvement in non-residential construction based on square footage. And we anticipate next year seeing maybe the same kind of growth, maybe a little bit better, somewhere between 7%, 8%, 9% growth in square footage next year. So that is certainly helping to support not only our structural business, but also our downstream businesses, our Vulcraft and Verco business, and frankly, our building systems business also. So yes, we see a pickup this year compared to last year. We see further improvement going forward into next year.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And on the marketing -- go ahead, sorry.","James D. Frias","I was just going to say, Timna, our comments are generally focused more on the quarter, and we don't generally say that much about what's happening in the future. Obviously, the fourth quarter is going to have a seasonal slowdown. But the comment I made in the script or I talked about the building momentum is this idea that an improvement of 8% this year, another improvement of 8%, 10% next year in square footage orders, yes, there's going to be some value to that; and so we are in agreement that there is some nice momentum happening in non-res and starting to get back to a level that is more sustainable.","John J. Ferriola","In terms of the margin, specifically, certainly, we're going to work really hard to maintain that margin. We think, as we mentioned in the script, that in the fourth quarter, we'll see some seasonal adjustments that happen every year, combination of the holidays and the weather. But we expect it to come back strong in the first quarter, and we look forward to a good year next year and we anticipate being able to hold onto those margins.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, cool. And then if I could, just one more. Clearly, you're hinting, at this point at least, a pretty low CapEx number and assuming this growth that we're talking about, a lot of cash flow. Just so, can you remind us about how you're thinking about opportunities for that use of cash? Would you consider the special dividend that you've done in the past? Do you like the M&A opportunities that have presented themselves, maybe further ones ahead? If you could just give us a categorization of what you're seeing out there.","John J. Ferriola","Well, I think it's -- I'll speak -- I'll let Jim speak to the special dividends, but I think it's -- I think I know where he's going to go with that one, okay, and appropriately so. Frankly, we're in a growth mode. We're a growth company, and we look for opportunities to grow the company. We believe that there's still plenty of opportunities out there. Remember that, as we talked about in the past, if we look at the way our company is structured, basically in the upstream, what we call core or side stream businesses, and our downstream businesses, we have numerous platforms in which we can grow, and that just multiplies the number of opportunities that we can look at out there. So we see opportunities downstream coming up that we're looking at. We have some upstream opportunities that we're continuing to look at. There's always the potential of expanding our DRI facility once we get past some of these typical start-up issues that we've been facing. And of course, you've seen what we've done with Gallatin. That was a great strategic opportunity, which not only provided us benefits today but positions us for other growth opportunities in that region. So I would not be looking to say that we're going to have a special dividend. I would say that a strong cash-generating position will be used to continue to grow the company, both in volume and in margin-enhancing improvements to our existing mills. And when the right acquisitions become available at the right price, we stand ready to aggressively pursue and be successful in acquiring them.","James D. Frias","And the only thing I'd add, Timna, is that we strongly believe in our dividend and a strong base dividend and a really strong earnings cycle. We will contemplate the possibility of a supplemental dividend. We're not there yet. We need to be north of $1.25 per share before we start thinking about something like that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have a couple of questions on DRI. First of all, forgive me if you have already -- just your DRI cost was much higher -- I'm sorry, the start-up cost was much higher. I was wondering, did something special happen versus what you gave as the guidance?","John J. Ferriola","Let me take that one on, Jim, okay, because I'll address some of the -- I'll just kind of give you a little bit of history of the start-up and that has, obviously, impacted our costs that you're referring to. And there's no doubt we've had some start-up issues with our equipment in Louisiana. But I got tell you, we've been very happy with the technology. You all have to remember, this is not new technology. This is proven technology. And this year, it's the first year of operation and we've had -- in this first year, we've had some issues, but we've also had some periods of operation where the plant operated over 90% of capacity with excellent quality; quality that, frankly, can only be described as world class. Now frankly, I would say it's quality that we define as world-class quality. And let's remember that year-to-date, we produced about 1.2 million tons of DRI in just the first year of production. We expect to produce another 500,000-or-so tons in the fourth quarter. And when we've met that expectation, and we believe we will, we will have produced about 1.7 million tons of DRI or about 70% of the capacity rating of that plant in the first year of operation. And that's operating at 70% of capacity in the first year with outstanding quality. Now we've had some start-up issues and let's maybe take a minute, since you've asked about the impact of those, to talk about it. We did have a design issue that we had to deal with in the second quarter of this year. We rectified that design issue. That was the flow feeders, we removed them. We removed them to improve the yield and the productivity of the facility. When we accomplished that, when we took them out and started up, we saw that we did, in fact, kill the problem. We achieved the expected improvements in both productivity and in yield. The start-up's strong in the second quarter, but a few weeks into the second quarter -- excuse me, third quarter, we experienced a failure of several wells in the process gas heater tubes, which was, frankly, completely unexpected. We repaired the wells and the plant operated in a very stable manner for the next 56 continuous days with excellent quality. And late in Q3, we experienced another issue with our process gas heater completely unrelated to the first issue of the wells on the tubes. They're a refractory problem, again, in the process heater, creating a potential for overheating and damaging that piece of equipment. So we made a decision to shut down and perform the repairs before we damaged the equipment. The plant was down for about 2 weeks. We made the necessary repairs. Since the repairs in the third quarter, the plant has been operating very stable, and we are confident in the completeness of the repairs that we've made to the gas processor. Both unexpected issues, both problems were on the same piece of equipment, a single part of the DRI production process: a process gas heater. The other plant, parts of the plant, very complex plant, have been operating with great reliability. I would also mention, since I'm on the topic here and since you asked the question, that these issues are not uncommon for a start-up. Remember, we had some similar issues in Trinidad. There, the problem was a reformer; different piece of equipment but very similar problems. We overcame them, and today, the plant in Trinidad is running extremely well and with good quality coming out of Trinidad also. So that's a little basket of color around why you're seeing the start-up costs higher than we might have expected at the start of the project. You want to make a comment about...","James D. Frias","Yes. And specifically to the comparison to what we were guiding, Sal, because our guidance was obviously for a smaller number. We were off by about $0.04. About $0.02 was the impact of the 2-week outage that happened right after we gave our guidance. And then the other $0.02 was related to -- each quarter end with a major capital project, we go through the details of the expenses that have been capitalized. And with all the work that was done in the third quarter on flow feeders and other things, we identified expenses that had been capitalized earlier in the quarter in July and August that we had to reverse into expenses that we didn't anticipate when we gave the guidance on September 17. So half of it was because of the issue that John talked about, the last one with the heat process...","John J. Ferriola","Process gas.","James D. Frias","Process gas, whatever they are. And the other $0.02 because of reviewing fixed asset accounting.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. No, this is good color, appreciate it. And running 70% of the first year is certainly a remarkable achievement. John, you mentioned about the...","John J. Ferriola","Particularly, this is the largest DRI plant in the world, okay, that we're starting up. So we are very pleased with that.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Certainly, certainly. You also mentioned, John, that the way you look at your cost is -- or pricing is pig iron less a value-in-use adjustment. Do you -- have you shared or would you like to share the number, what that number is for the value-in-use adjustment?","John J. Ferriola","That would be a no.","James D. Frias","So it could change over time. I mean, we have a fixed number we're using now, but as we assess how DRI works in the process, we could come to the conclusion it needs to change. So we're doing basically what we think the real value is.","John J. Ferriola","Yes, let me -- maybe I was a little bit too blunt there. Obviously, that -- at some point, we believe that there could be a merchant market for the DRI, so we don't want to give out of that information. But I will say this, that when we went into the project, we had a certain value-in-use penalty in mind, and again, as a result of the quality of the DRI that's coming out of Louisiana, it has performed much better than we anticipated in our furnaces. I think I mentioned in the past that we've seen a productivity increase. We've seen a decrease in our energy consumption as a result of the better quality coming out of that. We've seen a reduction in our electrical consumption. We've seen a reduction in our refractory life -- I mean, an improvement in our refractory life, excuse me, a reduction in our cost of refractors in the furnace. So we're really pleased, very, very pleased with the way that the product is performing in the furnace. And to Jim's point, as we continue to refine our process in Louisiana, we believe we can even hone in more carefully on a higher-quality product. And of course, as we learn to use the product more efficiently in our existing furnaces by changing our melt shop practices, that will also have a positive impact on the value-in-use.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And one last thing, you mentioned that at Gallatin, you can do further improvements over time or move up the value chain or something. I was just wondering, that value you're going to get out of Gallatin in the future, is that expanding the capacity? Or is moving up the value chain in terms of putting cold over galvanized capacity or...","John J. Ferriola","It would be moving up the value chain. There's many possibilities -- many possible ways of accomplishing that. At some point, we might put further processing in, in the plant or around the plant. I would also tell you that they've done a great job of establishing themselves in the pipe and tube market and known for good quality. As you know, some of our other sheet mills have expanded into higher-value products such as automotive, appliance, lawn and garden. There is absolutely no reason why we cannot transfer that knowledge from our mills to the mills at -- to the Gallatin mill. One area that I would specifically mention is the phenomenal work we've done at our other mills with high-strength, low-alloy steels and advanced high-strength steels. Those all go into additional margin and are value-added products that we can transfer without a lot of investment into the Gallatin facility.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Littlewood with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sal did ask most of my DRI questions, but I just had one on the gas hedging. Jim, I was surprised to hear you say just now that you had recently entered into some financial hedges for gas. My understanding previously had been that the Encana JV basically provided you with pretty much 100% of your gas requirements. Could you just help me sort of bridge the gap there and maybe [indiscernible] requirement...","James D. Frias","Yes, it's good for 2014. I'm sorry, the process -- we have over 300 wells producing right now. And those wells provide enough gas to cover full usage this year. And as we go into 2015, I think we start the year with enough gas to cover it. But as the year goes on, the wells will be in a decline curve. If there comes a point, and we're not saying there's a specific point, but we've got a -- quarter-by-quarter, there's a different amount that, at some point, will start being just a little bit short and we're hedging that portion that will become short. But I don't think that even by the end of 2015, what's the -- it's still more than 50% is coming from...","R. Joseph Stratman","[ph]","Yes, I don't know the exact percentage...","James D. Frias","It's somewhere in the neighborhood of 50% of gas is still coming from those 300 wells. They might be -- it's probably higher than that.","R. Joseph Stratman","[ph]","I think, Nathan, the -- as we look at -- in Jim's comments, in the prepared comments, he referred to the natural gas pricing environment today. And really, it's a fantastic option that we have, that we can produce gas from our own wells or hedge ourselves through a financial derivative, depending on which makes the best economic value. So we can always go back to drilling. The program we have available to us, if the economics are right, you are correct. We have enough gas that we will provide ourselves the DRI hedge for decades. It's just in the current moment, the economics would drive which is the best opportunity or option to cover that gas usage.","John J. Ferriola","And just to clarify because we've said in the past that the program would not only cover all of our DRI needs, but it would also provide enough gas to cover all of our steel mill gas consumption needs also. And -- but Joe is right. This gas isn't going anywhere. It's in the ground. Today, the gas price is somewhere around $3.75 or in that neighborhood, so we can get out of the ground then. We were able to secure a hedge, which really gave us a better economic opportunity to leave it in the ground for what we believe will be the day that gas will ultimately be more expensive.","Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. Just on this DRI plant a bit further then, I mean, you guys are obviously making sort of strategic decisions and thinking quite a lot about the raw material input costs here. Obviously, the bigger part of your cost base, though, is not gas at all; it's actually iron ore. We're now in an environment where we've got the lowest commodity price for 6 or so years. Asset values for iron ore businesses are probably as low as they've been in a decade. How are you thinking about potentially moving into iron ore at this point? Is that...","John J. Ferriola","Again, as I mentioned, with all potential acquisitions or opportunities, it's a function of the value of the asset that we're looking at and the price that it takes to own it. So are we looking? Certainly, okay? Is the environment today a whole lot better than it was 4 years ago? Absolutely, okay? Another -- this has been another example where Nucor's patience and tenacity has paid off. And we talked many times about Nucor's long-standing practice of buying during the downturns. This is clearly a downturn for that asset and we -- it's given us new opportunities to take a look at. I'm not going to comment on anything specifically, but certainly we are looking at those opportunities.","Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And are you having to go out and seek those sort of things? Or have you got people coming in knocking on your door, so to speak?","John J. Ferriola","Knocking on the door, let's just leave it at that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Philip Ross Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Had a question on the automotive market. Can you give us a feel for how much of your volume, including some of the downstream products, went into that market, maybe through the first 3 quarters of this year?","John J. Ferriola","Yes, we're running -- if you look at sheet -- I'll answer the question from 2 perspectives. I would answer in terms of our sheet products and I would answer in terms of our SBQ. In both cases, about 11% -- 10% or 11% of our total production of SBQ and sheet go into those markets. So 10% of our SBQ production is going into automotive today. About 10% or 11% of our sheet production is going into automotive today. I've mentioned in the past that our goal was 15%, so we're working to grow that. I can tell you we have many trials and qualifications going on in both -- with both SBQ and with sheet. And we remain confident that we'll be able to grow in those -- in the automotive market, which, as you know, is an extremely strong market. It has been growing. The market -- the automotive market has been growing, and frankly, we've been growing each year within that market. So we expect that to continue. Some of it is a result of the investments that we've made. One example would be the quality line at our mill in Memphis. That has really gone a long way towards getting us qualified at our Memphis mill in automotive applications.","Philip Ross Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Terrific. And I just had a question off of Nathan's here on the gas side. So as the year goes on in 2015, that you may be a little bit more than 50% practically. Were just you talking about the DRI facility? Or were you talking about your steel side?","James D. Frias","I'm talking about the DRI facility with the gas coming out of the wells. And what I meant to say is by the end of '16 because we've done hedges through '16. It's by the end of '16 that it gets to be about 50% hedged. It's much higher than 50% for all of '15.","Philip Ross Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So you're just talking about the DRI, you're not talking about the steel mills?","James D. Frias","Exactly. Yes.","John J. Ferriola","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aldo Mazzaferro with Macquarie.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","I just had a question for you on the Russian news yesterday and then also for Jim on the -- if I could give Jim the first one. I see the $45 million of start-up costs in the DRI. Jim, were there any other start-up costs that you could quantify in the quarter? I know you have a few other projects going, right?","James D. Frias","Yes, nothing else that has resulted in any material start-up costs.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then -- so John, on this Russian deal, right, I can see how the hot-rolled coil and plate get tariffed pretty heavily and that's good news for the market. I'm looking at the 75% of their inputs that are in the form of slab, and I know the integrated mills buy a lot of those. I know Nucor probably doesn't buy those because you have thin slab mills and you probably can't roll the thick slabs. I'm just wondering, do you think those slabs are dumped and possibly subject to trade cases in the future?","John J. Ferriola","Well as you mentioned, and you're correct, we don't buy slabs, so we're not that intimately involved with trade cases that are going on, on slabs. So I really don't want to comment too much on that. I'll make a general comment, though, about the termination of the suspension agreement. We see that as a positive certainly, and it's more than just taking the tons out of the markets, although there's a lot of tons that will be coming out of the markets at that low price. I mean, I think, year-to-date, there is somewhere around 700,000 tons of Russian pile coming in and -- but the more important factor, frankly, is by the termination of the suspension agreement, it raises the floor of the sheet pricing in the market. They were certainly -- the Russians were certainly setting the floor. There was a very low floor. By taking their ability to do that out of the market, that's going to be a plus for us and for our competitors.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was just following up on one of your earlier comments made about the spread of U.S. pricing, domestic versus imports, and that, that convergence could be met through a slight decline in U.S. prices but maybe an increase in foreign prices. And I was just wondering if you could just flesh out your thinking as to why you think foreign prices may be coming up.","John J. Ferriola","Well, I think it's a case of necessity. At some point, even with companies, competing companies that are getting subsidies, you've got to make some kind of a return. And some of the pricing that we're seeing from some of these companies today are just not sustainable. We believe that they are not sustainable, even with the government support. And frankly, if they depend more and more upon the government support, more government subsidies, that just enhances our ability to take action on the trade front because, obviously, that's a violation of the trade laws. So I think it's a combination of their costs. They've got to show some kind of a profit, and today, their pricing is, frankly, unsustainable. So we think that they're going to have to make some adjustments there. They see increasing costs just as we do, and frankly, they've got to be careful on the trade side.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then another question was just if you could kind of talk about the context. You're obviously looking forward to a recovering non-res and ultimately residential construction market in the U.S., and we haven't really seen the steel sector at full throttle since '06, '07. And do you think that there's enough growth in the market that imports will sort of be held at bay, or in kind of percentage terms, they've kind of taken your historic highs again and that there's structurally reasons in the U.S. market why imports will just level off, whether it's trade case related or just the ability of the end consumers to rely too heavily on imports that's just capped by the natural way the business is done in the U.S.? If you could just maybe talk to that point about, will imports level off, do you think? And is the growth sufficient enough in the domestic U.S. market for all participants?","John J. Ferriola","First comment, I do believe that the non-residential construction will continue to improve and that will provide a better market. To your second comment, there certainly are some issues that make it tougher for imports these days than they have in the past. One great example would be transportation in the United States. It's one thing to get the product onto the ports of the U.S. It's another to get it delivered to the final customer. Trucking is an issue. Frankly, we're seeing some evidence of delayed deliveries at the ports due to congestion. We've got the winter months coming up, that weather becomes a function or becomes an issue. So when you look at the final customer bringing in an import, he's got to look at several risks. I mean, obviously, he takes on risks in doing that: the delayed deliveries, the production delays or disruptions. Clearly, if there's a -- when you start talking about the higher-valued mark products, if there's a quality problem, the problem resolution becomes much more difficult. And frankly, we're seeing there's always a risk of unexpected increased costs in freight and other issues. And we serve a large portion of the market, particularly in our structural business, the fabricated markets, which really they cannot rely on inflected systems. They are not practical for them. So as we see non-residential construction continue to improve, clearly, the business for fabricated will continually improve, and our ability to serve them as a domestic supplier will continually improve.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Lane with Morningstar.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Given the steep decline in iron ore prices and lower natural gas prices, could you provide an update as for the likelihood that you'll move forward with the second DRI module in Louisiana? I'm imagining it's probably looking more and more likely. But in regards to the timing, would you be waiting for concrete evidence that you've established profitability with only the first module in place?","John J. Ferriola","Certainly, we would be looking at the performance of the first module. As I mentioned, we've had some unexpected failures. We've gone in and we were able to correct them. We would want to run -- a couple of things. Number one, we want to get more faith in the reliability of the operation. Our team in Louisiana, they've done a great job of fighting through the issues, but there's still work to be done in how to perfect the operation of that furnace. Before we moved on with another one, we want to make sure we understood all the potential issues with that technology. We have to make a decision, frankly, whether we stayed with that technology or because of a competitive pricing situation, move back to the Midrex. Certainly, there's been a -- we would expect there to be some spirited competition for that second vessel. I hope all of the potential suppliers are listening. And we will move forward when we gain confidence, as you said, in the lower input costs of the iron ore and the natural gas, although we don't worry about the natural gas because we have our own supply of natural gas. So it's really taking a look at the iron ore picture, but currently we believe that we're going to see the lower iron ore pricing probably for the next 3 to 5 years to be certain. And as we mentioned earlier, there might opportunities during that time for us to make an investment where we can secure the pricing for iron ore. That would be a positive factor in moving forward with the second unit. So those are the major issues we would use to determine when we would move forward with the next unit.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just another question. Could you provide some color as to what mix of scrap to iron ore derivatives the Gallatin operation currently applies and then what supply contracts are in place? And then also, does your plan for adding value to Gallatin involve applying the DRI you produce in-house? Or will you maintain the supply arrangements that are already in place for those non-scrap iron units?","John J. Ferriola","Well, currently, Gallatin's mix is about 80% scrap and 20% alternative iron units. We think that -- we would see that increasing to a much larger percentage after we had time to install the necessary feed equipment. That said, we certainly would feed the Gallatin facility from our in-house supplier. I'm not sure what contracts they have for the supplier from other sources. Nucor is a high integrity company. We will honor it, if they exist. But frankly, we're not -- we believe it's minimal, if they have any at all. And bear in mind that we have a major scrap processing facility right up in that same area, so it's -- we see synergies to be gained from our DJ Joseph family member with the Gallatin organization also.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Ferriola for any additional or closing remarks.","John J.

Please go ahead, sir.","John Ferriola","Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team: Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman, Dave Sumoski, and Chad Utermark.","The entire executive management team would like to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit, Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for a job extremely well done in 2014. You worked hard, worked smart, worked together, and most importantly, worked safely to deliver solid improvements in our performance despite steel industry conditions that remained very challenging. I am pleased to report that full year 2014 net income increased significantly by 46% to $714 million. We also achieved very robust growth in our cash generated from operations. 2014 operating cash flow represents our strongest performance since 2008 demonstrating the strength of our business model. That\u2019s the goal of more than 23,000 team mates continued their excellent work, implementing our company strategy for profitable growth. Subsequent to the last cyclical peak in the steel industry Nucor has invested significant capital in a large number of projects, have improved our core structure and expand our product portfolios to include more value and higher margin profits. In 2014, we began to see some of the early benefits from these strategic investments. There are more to come. In 2015 these investments will enhance our ability and navigate through the current challenges presented by energy industry turbulence and high levels of [indiscernible].","I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to review Nucor's fourth quarter performance and financial position. Following Jim's comments, I will update you on current market conditions and execution of our strategy for the long-term profitable growth. Jim?","James Frias","Thanks, John. Fourth quarter of 2014 earnings of $0.65 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.55 per diluted share. This outperformance was largely driven by better than expected results from our sheet mills, joist and decking business and our direct produce iron plant in Trinidad. Newly acquired Nucor Steel Gallatin made solid contributions to our fourth quarter earnings and cash flow even after absorbing about $9 million or $0.02 per diluted share after tax, our purchase accounting expenses early in the quarter.","We are encouraged by our fourth quarter performance given the strong seasonal and other influences dampening volumes during the period. Total sales turns to outside customers decline 10.5% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. A strong full year 2014 earnings improvement highlights the value of Nucor\u2019s industry leading product diversity. We are not America\u2019s only manufacturer of all four major steel mill products \u2013 bars, beams, plate and sheet. Our steel mill shipments of 22 million tonnes increased more than 6% year-over-year, which is more than double the U.S. steel industry\u2019s overall growth rate.","The increase steel mill volume is further leveraged by steel mill metal margin expansion of $32 per tonne. As a $37 per tonne gain in our average steel sales price are based at $5 per tonne increase and an average cost of iron units consumed. In addition to the strong profit growth at our core steel making operations, Nucor\u2019s downstream steel products segment more than double its profitability in 2014.","These businesses are benefitting from the initial stages of recovery in non-residential construction markets, particularly strong volume growth which was achieved in our joist, decking, and rebar fabrication products.","Nucor\u2019s 2014 earnings improvement was achieved despite significant operating loss at our facility at our DRI facility in Louisiana. Nucor Steel Louisiana\u2019s 2014 operating loss total $135 million or $0.28 per diluted share after tax and $35 million or $0.07 per diluted share after tax for the fourth quarter.","Production operations at Louisiana facility have remain suspended since the process gas heater experienced a failure in early November, due to the lead times on a specialty steel pipes that must be replaced. We estimate the plant will not resume operations until late in the first quarter. The process gas heater is not part of the DRI technology utilized by Louisiana, but it is ancillary equipment required to operate plant. The DRI technology stock has worked well and established new world-class quality levels as measured by metallization rates and carbon content. Although Louisiana has been a challenging start up, it will be a major step forward in the implementation of our long term raw material strategy.","The recent declines in iron ore pricing and the fourth quarter profits generated by our DRI facility in Trinidad provide further validation to our work over the past decade establishing and growing Nucor\u2019s DRI production capacity. A quick comment of our tax rate can be confusing due to the impacted profits from non-controlling interests. After adjusting our profits belonging to our business partners, effective tax rate was 33.6% from the fourth quarter and 35.3% for the full year of 2014.","Nucor\u2019s financial position remains strong at the end of 2014. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 37%. Cash and short-term investments totaled more than $1.1 billion at the close of 2014 putting our net debt-to-capital ratio at approximately 31%. Our next significant debt maturity is not until December of 2017. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving Credit Facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until August 2018. Nucor is the only North American steel producer to hold an investment grade credit rating.","John mentioned our very robust operating cash flow generation in 2014. Cash provided by operations of approximately $1.3 billion comfortably exceeded capital spending of $668 million combined with cash dividends paid to our shareholders of $475 million. In 2014, Nucor\u2019s strong balance sheet, liquidity and cash flow again allowed us to take advantage of attractive opportunities to build long term earnings power.","During the fourth quarter, we completed our purchase of all the equity of Gallatin Steel for cash purchase price of approximately $779 million. The acquisition was funded from cash-on-hand and issuance of approximately $300 million of commercial paper.","By the end of 2014, we have reduced the acquisition related commercial paper outstanding by half to about $151 million. For 2015, we estimate capital spending will be approximately $500 million. Most of our recent larger scale projects had been completed or are nearing completion. Our capital spending forecast also reflects our joint decision with Encana, our natural gas working interest partner to extend our drilling suspension through the end of 2015. This year\u2019s capital spending for drilling will be very modest and consistent drilling of few wells require to maintain leasehold rights. Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to total about $700 million.","Nucor\u2019s financial strength as evidenced by our strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow generation through the economic cycle is the deadlock foundation to our mission of growing shareholder value. From this position of strength, we are able to allocate our shareholders valuable capital to the most optimal or attractive usage at any given point in time. Our financial strength allowed us to invest in capital projects during the severe industry downturns and the long-term returns are most attractive. It allows us to make strategic acquisitions when the right assets at the right price become available in the market. And just as importantly it allows us to reward our shareholders with a steadily growing base dividend, supplemental dividends during up cycles, and opportunistic share repurchases.","During the current downturn from 2009 to 2014, our investments totalled nearly $6 billion which is about two-thirds going to capital spending and one-third going to acquisitions. These diverse projects all grow Nucor's long term earnings power by expanding our private portfolio into higher value added offerings that are less vulnerable to imports, by improving our cost structure and finally by building upon our market leadership positions.","Growing stronger during downturns is a long tradition of Nucor. It is how we achieve higher highs and profitability from on cyclical beat to the next. With our disciplined approach to capital allocation and success in building long-term earnings power, Nucor is able to reward shareholders with attractive cash returns are based on the dividend, it has more than tripled to the end of 2007.","With the increase affected with next month's quarterly dividend payment, Nucor has increased its base dividend every year since it first began paying dividends in 1973 for 42 consecutive years. During the last industry up-cycle from 2004 to 2008, Nucor paid a total of $5 per share in supplemental dividends. And over the 10 year period ending in 2014, Nucor returned a total of $6.7 billion of capital to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic stock buybacks.","The Nucor team\u2019s unrelenting focus remains on continuing to build upon our record of being an effective steward of our shareholders valuable capital.","First quarter of 2015 earnings will be impacted by the significant headwinds that developed for the steel industry at the end of 2014. The collapse in oil prices has triggered inventory reductions amongst pipe and tube producers an important customer group for Nucor and the overall steel industry. At the same time, imports are up automatically entering in 2015.","Now, on the margin\u2019s side, we are continuing to see favorable trends in non-residential construction markets that will benefit both our steel mills and fabricated construction products. Overall, we expect first quarter 2015 earnings will decrease in fourth quarter to a level slightly exceeding the first quarter of 2014.","Nucor will again follow a practice of providing quantitative guidance in the final month of the quarter. Whatever short-term economic and steel industry conditions we face in 2015, Nucor\u2019s unrivalled position and strength will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth.","We appreciate your interest in our company. John?","John Ferriola","Thanks, Jim. There certainly has been an abrupt change in the near term outlook in the recent weeks. The two headwinds mentioned by Jim, collapse in oil prices and surging imports will certainly challenge our team during the first quarter but that's okay. Our team has faced and overcome challenges and adversity in the past. And we\u2019ll do it again. Energy is an extremely important driver of demand for steel in the U.S. and here at Nucor. Pipe and tube produces serving the energy markets represent approximately 10% of our steel mill shipments. Meaningful production and inventory adjustments for our pipe and tube customers are currently underway.","Following this period of marketplace adjustment, we believe the future remains very positive for local energy production in North America. Importantly, lower energy costs over time should support increased U.S. manufacturing activity and consumer spending. That is all very positive for Nucor.","The other major headwind is from the renewed surge in import activity. Full year 2014 import of finished carbon steel products are estimated to have jumped to an unreasonable and unacceptable level of approximately 34 million tonnes. That\u2019s an increase of about 37% over 2013 and just under 2006\u2019s record level of 35 million tonnes.","Indications are that January 2015; finished steel imports may set a monthly record of around 3.9 million tonnes. These short-term headwinds are significant but the Nucor is extremely well-positioned and navigate through them, and we will.","Some key advantages of our Company come immediately to mind. We will benefit from our low and highly variable cost structure. Additionally, we expect continued growth in non-residential construction activity.","Iron use, are the largest single-cost item. As previously mentioned, profitability at our DRI plant Trinidad is benefiting from a large decline in iron ore cost. After resuming production from the Louisiana facility we will also benefit from what appears to be an oversupplied oil market over at least the next several years.","Continuing on the raw material cost topic, we believe that the U.S. graph is currently significantly over priced versus iron ore and global scrap markets. Based on increased imported steel penetration, slack international demand for US scrap, the strength of the U.S. dollar and moderating U.S. demand for [indiscernible]. We expect scrap prices to fall dramatically in early 2015. During this period of transition, Nucor will continue to utilize our unmatched global supply chain, optimized all raw material costs. Our investments in DRI and then scrap yards as well as access to international raw material markets hears Nucor\u2019s best in class capabilities and profitability and approaching the market for iron units.","Non-residential construction markets count for more than half of the end-user demand of Nucor\u2019s products as measured by square footage, U.S. non-residential construction activity increased by 6.7% in 2014. We expect continued improvement in 2015. There is worth nothing that 2014 square footage activity level represents only about 56% of 2007\u2019s peak activity level. So there is plenty of room for additional improvement.","Whenever the steel industry and the economy see unexpected periods of turbulence like what we are experiencing now in early 2015, Nucor will do what Nucor always does. We will grow bigger, stronger, and more profitable and we will outperform our competitors.","Here are the reasons why Nucor will do this. Our balance sheet and twin cycle cash flow generation is unviable by any of our competitors. Our industry leading product and market diversity continues to grow as we move up the value chain in all of our businesses. The recent expansions in our offerings include normal lines and E-treated plates, wider and lighter sheet steels, additional SVQ and wire rod products and new filing sections. All of these products are less impacted by our rationally priced imports. Our low cost structure will benefit from increased DRI production capacity as our new Louisiana facility completes it start-up process this year.","Our commitment to achieve commercial excellence by leveraging Nucor's competitive advantages, such as product diversity and operational flexibility to create more value for and build stronger relationships with each of our customers, and most importantly Nucor\u2019s employees, the right people. They are our company\u2019s greatest asset and our greatest competitive advantage. Here are just a few of their 2014 achievements, implementing our strategy of investing a long-term profitable growth.","In the fourth quarter, our Nucor remodel structure steel mills began client production of its new sheet filing sections. The initial output was sold to Skyline Steel, a Thailand distributor and will be installed next month at a construction project in New Jersey.","Nucor model expanded its product portfolio to include wider filing sections that are wider and stronger covering more area at a lower install cost. The market with these high value added mix products is currently [indiscernible].","In addition to taking advantage, of Nucorean models world class structural steel manufacturing capabilities.","Our customers will benefit from this new domestic solution which will create valuable strategies with the other products and services offered by Skyline Steel.","Acquired in 2012, Skyline is the market leader in its business with an unreliable package of engineering support, stocking locations, processing centers and dedicated sales teams. In 2014, Nucor\u2019s Steel Hertford County\u2019s plate mill leveraged their T-trading capabilities to capture a growing share of the market for value-added plate products. For example, in 2014, Hertford County has more than doubled its share of the bridge market during the current steel industry down. Over the same period, shipments to higher margin OEM customers have doubled as a percent of mill\u2019s total volume.","These value-added products are also less vulnerable to pressure from commodity influence. Our Nucor steel Berkeley sheet Mills successful start up in 2014of its wide light capital project continued to build momentum. Shipments in the new wide light products totalled over a 120,000 tonnes in the first year. Berkeley now has the lightest, hot rolled gauge capacity capability of any sheet mill in the Southern U.S. market and with a finished product width up to 72 inches.","We estimate the size of the new market segment now available to Berkeley to be approximately 4 million tonnes annually. Of particular importance, the upgrade allows Nucor to produce thinner, high strength field grade that could be used to develop light weight automotive applications.","In closing, based upon all of these strategic factors and the faith, the absolute faith, I have in our team\u2019s ability to face and overcome challenges, I remain very confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. Thank you for your interest in Nucor. We will now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Luke Folta with Jefferies.","Luke Folta - Jefferies","Hi! Good afternoon.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon, Luke. How are you?","Luke Folta - Jefferies","Good. First question is on, in the release you talked about what you're expecting in terms of demand in First Quarter and you made some comments around an expectation for significantly lower scrap prices. Just trying to get a sense, if you could give us some more color around what your price expectations are heading into 1Q? What takes into the assumption that earnings should be slightly higher year on year, and also, if you could give us some sense of what your LIFO expectation would be as well that would be helpful.","John Ferriola","Let me start with the first part of the question and I\u2019ll turn over to Jim for the rightful comments. Let me start by saying that our first quarter outlook is based upon what we see today in the current scrap pricing. As I mentioned in the script, there are numerous reasons why we believe that that pricing will decline dramatically in the early part of the year, we believe probably in the first quarter. One of the biggest drivers for that is when you look at our steel pricing, our steel pricing has already gone down, hence, the decrease in those products maybe $50 to $100 per tonne. As a result, scarp pricing has to follow that steel pricing down. We see the steel pricing under pressure because of the imports that are coming in as produced with iron ore giving them a cost advantage to the overall scrap market that has said, we believe will adjust. There is certainly lot of reasons we believe that we are going to see the scarp pricing drop significantly over the next couple of months. It got the strength of the U.S. dollar, global scrap markets are low, scrap imports are bound to start coming in and as I mentioned decreased demand for steel scrap as a result of decreased production of steel because of the pressure that we\u2019re seeing both because of the import being produced by the iron ore, and because of the iron the oil pricing as we mentioned in the script.","So given these reasons, we believe very strongly that we will see a dramatic drop in scrap pricing in the first quarter. The other thing that I wanted to mention is that we are seeing some impact on lag of the scrap pricing moves due to the inventories in our mill. So we are currently, in our mills higher priced scrap because there's usually a four to six week lead time and a lag time in our use of the inventories. So given all of those reasons, we believe that a: scrap pricing is going to come down dramatically and I want to stress that it\u2019s following steel pricing now. The steel pricing has already come down. Scrap pricing must follow. And I also want to mention that, again, that we based our First Quarter outlook based upon current scrap pricing. Jim, you want to touch upon the LIFO adjustments?","Jim Frias","Yes, little more assuming, $25 million LIFO credit for the year, and obviously if metal prices fall as dramatically as we think they could we will end up having a larger credit, just bigger advance but we\u2019re going to start the year off looking -- I think it comes to $6.5 million in expense in first quarter for a 25 million annualized base.","Luke Folta - Jefferies","Okay, so just to be clear, whenever the scarp move that we could see in February, I think last update, some of the people we were talking to were looking for down 30 to 50, maybe that\u2019s changed over the past week or so. But your expectation now would be, your guidance were based on today\u2019s scrap price before the down movement in February or that would be included in that?","Jim Frias","Luke as John has explained, we tend to have scrap in the ground and so when we made the forecast we are assuming that the benefit of foreign scrap price because we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to fully come through in February or late in the March that will just start to see some of the benefit in March and so if we see it sooner, our results could be better. But our forecast probably is a big concern in terms of we seeking any benefit from scrap prices if that helps. We will like here to specific numbers and I frankly don\u2019t have that it\u2019s a bottoms up forecast for every business unit, individually making a forecast.","Luke Folta - Jefferies & Company","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just the second one, in terms of your energy demand, your shipments. John, I think you said it was 10% or so of your total steel shipments. Can you give us some sense of how that breaks out by product from flat-roll versus SBQ? And anything in terms of the magnitude of how that's changed just over the past month or so, or in the First Quarter, would be very helpful, thank you.","John Ferriola","The vast majority of the horizontal sheet products are about three quarters of our shipments not of sheet products maybe 75% to 80% of a small amount that comes out of SBQ. As I mentioned we've seen a significant adjustment by our customers to produce it, pipe and tube that's into the oil business. They are adjusting their inventories and we will see an impact upon our order book. But I do want to stress as I mentioned several times in the script, the investments that we\u2019ve made over the last several years in diversifying our products and our markets will help us get through this period. Just as one of [indiscernible] of information when you look at just in 2014 is about 700,000 tonnes of products that is either new or value-added product or product we can now supply into markets and we could not supply into previous to these investments.","So although we\u2019re going to be taking a hit on the oil and gas, no doubt about it, 10% of our shipments are linked to that. We believe that through the investments that we've made in diversifying our products will mitigate that impact. I'll also stress as I mentioned in the script that 50% of oil products go into non-residential construction and we expect to see continued improvement in that market.","Luke Folta - Jefferies & Company","Thanks for the color.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Matt Murphy with Union Bank Switzerland.","Matthew Murphy - UBS Investment Bank","Good afternoon. The question is just on, I guess your order book -- I mean how do you, what sense are you getting, are customers holding off waiting for the market to find a bottom or are you finding pretty healthy inquiries out there?","Jim Frias","Other than the pipe and tube that's oil and gas related, the rest of the markets are okay. Now certainly there's a lot of doubt about what\u2019s going to happen, both on pricing, but I think more particularly on what the customers view might happen with scrap pricing which is why I am once again emphasizing that it\u2019s an unusual event where we are going to see scrap pricing following steel pricing down, typically it\u2019s reversed. This time because of the pressure from imports and from our competition that is ore based, we are seeing the inverse effect take place. Steel pricing has gone down before scrap pricing. We believe that quite, as I mentioned scrap pricing will follow it down and it will happen pretty quickly and pretty dramatically, but again it is following the steel pricing down. Not the other way around. And I think our customers understand that and so as they are not expecting large price decreases as scrap continues to rebound because we've already seen the impact of that on our pricing. One other, important that I mention, in terms of just booking as a general statement. We talked about imports being high and although we\u2019ve been successful in some of our trade cases on rebar and hot-rolled coil and wire rod, there's still a lot of imported steel that's in inventory that is impacting our order book. We\u2019ll see that from the next couple of months.","Matthew Murphy - UBS Investment Bank","Sure. That's helpful. And then when you talk about repeatedly your strategy of going into higher end product, how are you finding competition from imports in the higher end categories? And if that remains a better business for Nucor than for imports, is it fair to say maybe we would see imports continuing to attack in some of the lower end applications? So maybe you don't get the volume growth, but you still get the margin growth from the higher end products? Maybe if you could just talk through how that might look, thanks.","Jim Frias","Well clearly, the higher value products have a greater resistivity to imports as well as having higher margins, so you kind of get a double benefit of that. In terms of your comment about we expect to see volumes not growing, I would not agree with that statement. We expect to see our volumes grow the higher value added products just as we continue to develop them being more and more market share. And it\u2019s always been Nucor\u2019s policy, we don\u2019t give up on the lower commodity products. Okay. We're in this game across the full spectrum. We are just as interested in maintaining our market share in rebar as we are developing the advanced high strength steels. We'll grow in all of the products that are out there. As we\u2019ll not concede market share easily to be our competitors or from [indiscernible] importing pressure will continue [indiscernible] in other words, we will gain higher ground without giving up what we already have. Does that answer your question?","Matthew Murphy - UBS Investment Bank","Perfect, thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Good afternoon every one. Question for you, I am guessing Jim, you\u2019re probably following this literally in the playing field act that Senator Blair introduced last December and I was just wondering if you kind of walk us through what that might actually mean for the steel industry? How could that benefit Nucor and this might be asking too much but you're handicapping whether such legislation might be able to make it to Republican Congress?","John Ferriola","I am going to ask our political guru, to answer that question to the level that we can answer it.","Jim Frias","If that may the equation, it\u2019s going to be good for us but something that\u2019s very difficult to get through the system. So I really don't want to do answer it on this call but I'd be happy to talk to you afterwards.","Evan Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, so you will let me call after the --","John Ferriola","Give us a call later in the day or tomorrow and we will give you some more color on that.","Evan Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. I will definitely follow up. Maybe I'll just ask about the trade case on the coated [indiscernible] products. Where does that stand right now, know it's hung up a little bit because of the concerns about the injury determination. With pricing rolling over as much as it has over the past quarter, are we getting a little bit closer to the point where we may actually see something pretty soon?","John Ferriola","I am not going to answer that specifically. I will say that like a general statement that we will be proactive, and we will be aggressive. The level of import is infringing at which absolutely ridiculous levels, and we believe that there's a potential for action coming up. We're monitoring the situation very closely, and that we will be aggressive. We look back at the last couple of cases and the success. And we\u2019ve had all those cases. We had the rebar case against Mexico. We were very successful in that case, and we saw rebar imports from Mexico reduced by about 70%.","We've seen wire rod, the case against China, result in virtually eliminating the Chinese wire rod from the US market. And finally I would mention the suspension agreement, the elimination of suspension agreement for hot rolled coil, against Russia. And we\u2019re seeing significant, and we anticipate continuing to see significant reductions in Russian hot rolled coil coming into the country. So based upon those recent successes, we\u2019ve got pretty good about our chances going forward. I am going to leave with that. We\u2019ll monitor it closely. We will be aggressive and we will be proactive in pursuing cases when it is appropriate.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Sal Tharani from Goldman Sachs.","Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon. A couple of questions. First on the end markets, more than 50% is non brand 10% energy; anything big you want to mention after these two?","John Ferriola","I would mention, as we mentioned several times in past calls, automotive. We\u2019re looking at about 10% of our automotive qualified steels will go in today, 10% of our steels that are qualified steels will go in today, 10% of our steels that are qualified going to automotive. We're shipping into that sector. If we look at our total tonnage, about 5% of that will be going for automotive today. Usually we don\u2019t normally count structural steel beams and not much of that will be going to the automotives. We don\u2019t factor that in. But if you look at what is possibly going to automotive, we\u2019re shipping about 10% of that flat-rolled SBQ into automotive today. SBQ has just picked up a little bit in SBQ over the last year. It might have bumped up about 11%. But again, flat steel represents the vast majority of product that we're putting into automotive factory.","Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs","And you postponed drilling this year. How long can you do that? Is that part of contract? Or do you pay if gas prices to remain low? Do you have ability to continue postponing it?","John Ferriola","We could continue to postpone it as long as we and our partner Encana agree to do that. And as we've mentioned several times we have a great relationship with and we constantly communicate with them. We made a decision this year to suspend drilling other than the few wells that are necessary to maintain the results. And we will take a look at the situation again during the course of the year. If we should see a sudden increase, sporadical increase in pricing, we'll begin drilling and if we don\u2019t we will suspend it again. The key thing to remember about this agreement is that the gas is in the ground. It\u2019s not evaporating. It\u2019s not going anywhere. It\u2019s there waiting for the right, the optimum opportunities for us to take it out of the ground.","Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs","Are you hedged for gas this year?","John Ferriola","We are partially hedged for gas. It's a percentage of production at the Louisiana plant, which we're using, obviously at our Steel Mills that are operating.","Q \u2013 Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. I'll get back in the line with some more questions. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Yu with Citi.","Brian Yu \u2013 Citigroup","Great, thanks. I want to go back to the comment you made earlier about the scrap prices. And as I think about it, at first it is going to start with the scrap yards. And I was wondering if you can share with us, what's happening with the buy prices that you're getting at the yards that you operate? How much are those down say as you go into February?","John Ferriola","I'm not going to give specific numbers, but I will say that they are down significantly and we expect that and we\u2019re reacting properly to it. But I'm not going to give obviously any specific numbers. Our competitors would love to hear that number.","Brian Yu \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. On the energy side, obviously that's having an impact. Can you give us a sense of how much have orders dropped so far in the year versus, say, what you were seeing back in 4Q? And is there any backlogs when you ship to the OCTG manufacturers that you're working off of now?","Jim Frias","Yeah. There is a small backlog that we are working all the way through. We are working with our customers. We understand the situation that they face and the inventory problems that they're looking at. So, we've been working with them on that. As I said before, we've seen significant drop in the orders for our flat-rolled product going into oil and gas. Our other markets remained very strong. Heavy truck is still looking very good. Automotive is still looking very good. So, there are areas where we feel confident that our order book remains strong. We have seen a significant drop in our orders for specifically pipe and tube that goes into the energy markets.","Brian Yu \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, can I get one more in?","Jim Frias","You got one more that's it?","Brian Yu \u2013 Citigroup","All right, thanks. Gallatin, I think roughly half of the shipments go into the energy markets. Are there other end markets at that facility?","John Ferriola","I don\u2019t know. I apologize, but I've got to correct you right off of the bat. It's true that about half of their product is the pipe and tube. But the vast majority of that goes into structural tubing and we\u2019re about 10% of Gallatin products, shipments going to energy related pipe and tube, which is similar to our number here in Nucor.","Operator","We will go next to Timna Tanners of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to just ask you about there's some talk about blast furnaces, iron capacity in response to the level of import and the destocking on energy tubular as you mentioned. Just two questions I guess, one is how long do you think this destocking might last? And secondly, would Nucor be among those that's pre-emptively idling some capacity in response to a large level of import?","John Ferriola","Well, it's hard to predict how long this is going to last. That's somewhat of a function of how long and how deep the oil pricing situation goes on. And you get all kinds of predictions on that. It\u2019s frankly, as far as I'm concerned, if anyone guesses at this point and entirely up to the producers and how much oil they start pumping out of the ground. But currently, if we were to remain at today\u2019s levels of oil pricing, and we look at the inventories we will be looking at probably around six to seven or eight months of inventory on the ground at today\u2019s usage.","Now having said that, there is always a stop to a system when something has a radical change and we see that happening today. Big change people throughout the entire supply chain are caught with inventory on hands, it\u2019s a radical, it\u2019s a major change, major reduction in the orders. Even then there will be a period of time when all of this works out and starts flushing through. And we'll begin to see the orders for pipe and tube going to energy returning to a new normal level, albeit less than where it was. But there will be some level greater than wordings today, but less than where it was a year ago. The other thing that I would mention about that is that you asked about shutting off, reducing our capacity.","As you know, Timna, our furnaces are extremely flexible. We make that decision on a weekly basis. We want our mills to fill orders and giving our wearable cost structure and the flexible schedules that we have we can react extremely quickly that any changes whether or not we see some improvement in that energy market quicker than we anticipated or whether we see enough tick in one or the other markets we stand ready to be very quick in responding to any changes in the market. Again when you compare our operations to those of the blast furnace, clearly once you shutdown a blast furnace it's down for awhile and we have much greater flexibility. We don\u2019t need to shutdown an EAF. We can simply skip a couple of heat, so skip a couple of shift and come back in a couple of days if we see the order book warranting that.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. If I could, I also just wanted to see if you could give a little bit more color on the plate and SBQ markets, given that they have some energy exposure, and just haven't heard as much about them lately.","John Ferriola","We haven\u2019t seen much of an impact on either the plate or the SBQ markets. Now certainly there is some small amount, but a lot of our plate that goes into what we would call energy might go in to wind towers and other applications that really are impacting this heavily by the oil price going down. Because I mentioned earlier SBQ does, so a little bit into that. It\u2019s been growing. We've been focused on that as a growth area, but it's not that heavy for us. When we see the bigger impact frankly, on our order book in both SBQ and, particularly in plates is due to the imports. So we see some impact due to the oil pricing but frankly a larger impact due to imports.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, thank you very much.","John Ferriola","Timna, one more thing that I might mention that, you mentioned specifically about the plate market. When you think about some of the infrastructure, although it's coming way too slowly, there are some infrastructure repairs being made particularly in the bridge. And there's a couple bridges going on. Some bridge fabrication, bridge repair and our plate business is doing well in that area. So we\u2019re seeing some pickup in our plate order book as a result of general infrastructure and particularly bridge fabrication.","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan.","Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan","I have a question just about this whole change in the raw material market share, particularly with the stock move and the lack of the scrap move, I guess relative to iron ore in past six months. But when you look forward, I would think in the next few months, it will be a great opportunity to gain share particularly on the sheet market not to close down your production because if you\u2019re not ready, you're going to become the low cost producer in market for sheet. And when you look at the sheet market, it\u2019s about two thirds iron ore integrated based on about a third, even the rest of mini-mills on the sheet side and you've been suffering from a relative cost disadvantage because scrap didn\u2019t come down relative to iron ore in the last six months and now it is. So, going forward you've kind of seen the worst scenario. You relative to integrated [Licax] [ph] and AK. But isn't there a great opportunity to pick up some share as your costs drop and their costs basically don't?","John Ferriola","I\u2019ll say that we have seen the worst of the times relative to opposition because we do believe scrap is coming down. I will point out that we fared a little bit better on our cost side relative to most of EAF-based competitors because of our DRI situation. We call that with the iron ore pricing going down, our DRI cost of production has been going down also. And so we've seen benefit at our Trinidad facility and we will see a benefit as our Louisiana facility comes back into line. So, yes, we believe we've seen worse of the times. Okay. Yes, we see scrap pricing going down and we will benefit from that. Yes, we played better than our other competitors in the EAF arena because of our DRI capabilities. I'm not going to [indiscernible] what all that means going forward. We will stay competitive. We will take care of our customer needs. We will continue to supply our customers with high quality, fairly priced product on time with great service. And we will see how it plays out in the market place.","Michael Gambardella \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay.","Operator","And we will go next to Andrew Lane with Morningstar","Andrew Lane - Morningstar","Given the significant declines in both iron ore and natural gas prices since this time last year, do you expect to achieve profitable DRI production in Louisiana shortly after the facility is restarted? Or will it likely take some time to ramp up production before your output is profitable?","John Ferriola","Well, it will take some time to ramp up our production and it will also take some time to work through the iron and higher cost iron ore inventory that we have on the ground, iron ore that was purchased last year, that we have now worked all way through because the facility has been out of commission. So it will take time to work through that inventory and it will take some time to get up to full production. But we expect to see the Louisiana facility running well and profitable by the end of the ear.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar","Okay, great. And then to change gears, you mentioned that the energy end market represents about 10% of your steel mill shipments. Could you provide a split as to how much of that total is directly associated with the shipments for oil and gas drilling projects, and how much is associated with shipments for other energy related applications, such as power generation?","John Ferriola","We don\u2019t break it down that definitively. I would say to you that probably, if you look at the energy pipe and tube as opposed to other oil and gas applications, you're looking at probably 90% going directly into the energy pipe and tube that would be associated with drilling, maybe 10%, and that would be rough numbers here, maybe 80:20, 90:10 somewhere in that area.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar","Okay, that's helpful, thanks. If I can just ask one last question. Would you be able to provide an update as to how the integration process is going through the Gallatin Steel operations? And are the incremental 2015 benefits you initially expected still intact?","John Ferriola","I would love to do that actually. The integration is going extremely well. We expected that it would go well. The team there is a great team and management style. Their culture is very similar to our Nucor culture. So we anticipated a smooth integration. But I have to tell you what, its gone even better than we anticipated. Those guys is doing a great job. The financial team there, I\u2019d give a call out to them, they very-very quickly integrated into our financial programs. I am surrounded by some financial people in the room here and they are all nodding their head, saying what a great job, the Gallatin financial team did, in getting up to speed very quickly, converting the systems, integrating the systems. I would also make that statement relative to the commercial team. They integrated extremely well with our commercial team. We're enjoying the synergies that we\u2019ve anticipated from that and it\u2019s going great.","Operator","And this does conclude the question and answer portion of today\u2019s conference call. I would like to turn the call back over to John Ferriola for comments and closing remarks.","John Ferriola","Well, thank you. Let me just conclude by saying thank you to our shareholders. We certainly appreciate your confidence and your support. Thank you to our customers. We appreciate your business. I want to say thank you to all of my Nucor teammates for creating value for our customers, generating attractive returns for our shareholders and building a sustainable future","generating a attractive returns for our shareholders and building a substantial future for all of us. And most importantly thank you all for doing it safely. And for everyone on the call today, thank you for your interest in Nucor.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.","Certain statements made during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Please go ahead, sir.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call and for your interest in Nucor. Other members of Nucor's executive team are also on the call today, including Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Craig Feldman, responsible for Raw Materials; Ladd Hall, responsible for Sheet Products; Ray Napolitan, responsible for Engineered Bar Products; MaryEmily Slate, responsible for Tubular Products; Dave Sumoski, responsible for Merchant Bar and Rebar Products; Leon Topalian, responsible for Beam and Plate Products; and Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated Construction Products.","My remarks will be brief this afternoon as we covered a lot of this material at our recent Investor Day event. Thank you to everyone who participated, either in person or via the webcast. And for those who could not join us, a recording of the event and the slide presentation are available at nucor.com.","Before we discuss our second quarter earnings, I would like to thank our teammates for continued excellent safety performance. Safety is the number one priority for everyone on the Nucor team and we continue to work to improve at it, identifying and mitigating risks and changing behaviors to achieve our goal of zero incidents at every Nucor facility.","Turning now to our performance in this quarter. Our financial results were lower than our expectations at the start of the quarter. Unusually wet weather and aggressive supply chain destocking impacted mill order rates in the first half of 2019. We have seen lower volumes during the first half of this year resulting in a more challenging price environment.","However, real demand for our products remains strong in key end-use markets. We see healthy conditions in end-use markets that typically account for more than two thirds of our steel shipments. For this reason, we are cautiously optimistic that pricing has bottomed on most of our products and that volumes should be more closely aligned with real end-use demand in the second half of the year.","We all know that the steel industry is cyclical and we have built our business model around that reality with our low and highly variable cost structure and our diversified product portfolio. Our performance in the first half of the year, benefited from meaningful year-over-year earnings gains in our Plate, MBQ, Rebar, Joist and Deck, Metal Buildings and Pilings Distribution businesses once again highlighting the benefits of our diversified product mix.","Our strategy to increase market share in automotive applications also continues to bear fruit. We are currently shipping into this market at an annual rate of about 1.6 million tons. Further, we were recently named Supplier of the Year by General Motors. We are the first EAF-based steel producer to receive this recognition. It's a tremendous testament to our team and further evidence of our success, moving up the value chain and gaining market share in many value added applications.","As we have previously discussed, we have several investment projects coming online this year, and I want to update you on this status. In our Sheet Group, we continue to ramp-up production of our new specialty cold mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas and we have been pleased with the performance. This project will allow us to produce higher valued products, especially in high-strength steels and it will differentiate Nucor Steel Arkansas from its competitors.","We are currently in trials for value-added applications and customer acceptance has been excellent to this point. We are targeting to have as much as 20% of the new mills capacity, booked with contract customers by the year-end. We expect to continue adding contract volumes at the mill as 2020 progresses.","In Kentucky, Nucor Steel Gallatin has begun commissioning its new galvanizing line and test running coils to verify the functionality of the line. Production of pickled and oiled coils has started this month and will be followed by production of galvanized coils in August. With 500,000 tons of annual capacity, this 72-inch galvanizing line will be the widest hot-rolled galvanizing facility in North America.","Gallatin is now positioned to supply the underserved Midwest heavy-gauge hot band galvanized market. The new line will enable us to grow our automotive applications to include frames, control arms, supports, and brackets.","Our commercial teams are excited to have these new capabilities in our Sheet Mill Group to serve both new and existing customers. The last project in our Sheet Mill Group, I would like to mention is our joint venture with JFE Steel in Mexico. We are on track for startup of the galvanizing line later this year and we look forward to serving automotive customers in Mexico.","In the Bar Mill Group, our Marion, Ohio bar mills new inline rolling mill is starting up in the third quarter. Marion's new reheat furnace, which we installed last year, is reducing our natural gas consumption by about one-fourth.","In late 2019 or early 2020, Marion will also install quench and temper equipment to reduce alloy costs at the melt shop. The upgrades significantly improved Marion's efficiency and strengthens its leadership position in the regional rebar market.","Two other projects in our Long Products Group are on track for startups later this year. The merchant bar product expansion at our mill in Illinois, and the first of our new rebar micro mills, which is located in Sedalia, Missouri.","In all, we have 10 significant organic investments in various stages of development, representing a total capital investment of approximately $3.5 billion that will deliver long-term profitable growth to our shareholders.","As I have made clear on several occasions, we are not simply adding tons to get bigger. These projects target defined market objectives and opportunities to generate higher profits and reduced volatility through the cycle. They also expand our product portfolio, so that we will be able to offer our customers more solutions to meet their toughest challenges.","The U.S. steel industry continues to benefit from effective trade enforcement through May of 2019 total and finished steel imports declined by 12% and 18% from last year's levels. In the last 12 months, approximately 6 million fewer tons of imported steel have come into the U.S. market. The decrease in imports reflects the cost competitiveness of our domestic steel industry and the success of our industries ongoing efforts to see that the rules of trade are enforced.","Recent findings by the U.S. Department of Commerce provide further evidence that our industry, our government, and our customers understand the importance of acting to keep on fairly traded steel and steel products from distorting the U.S. market.","On July 2, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued its Preliminary Circumvention Determination on imports of galvanized and cold-rolled sheet steel from Vietnam manufactured with hot-rolled or cold-rolled substrate from South Korea and Taiwan.","Commerce found that the steel went through minor modifications in Vietnam to avoid appropriate restrictions that have been imposed on imports from South Korea and Taiwan. The imports of these products from Vietnam must now pay duties of more than 400%. It is vitally important that our government stopped these and similar illegal transshipments meant to avoid trade duties, and we are glad that they have taken such a strong action.","On July 8, the U.S. Department of Commerce also issued a Preliminary Countervailing Duty Determination on imports of fabricated structural steel from China and Mexico, and duties have been applied to imports from both countries. This ruling shows that the government is not only concerned about unfair trade practices in raw steel, but also in downstream products.","Rules-based trade is a critical underpinning to the continued success of our customers, Nucor and the U.S. economy, and we are pleased that the Department of Commerce continues to take action on individual trade cases.","Jim Frias will now provide more specific detail about our second quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of this year. Jim?","James Frias","Thanks, John. Nucor reported second quarter of 2019 earnings of $1.26 per diluted share. Earnings from our Steel Mills segment were lower due primarily to reduced shipments to our service center customers, reflecting their caution with respect to inventory levels and order rates in a weakening price environment.","Earnings from our Steel Products segment improved in the second quarter in line with our expectations. Strong non-residential construction markets, along with increased productivity from our rebar fabrication and metal buildings businesses were the primary factors.","Results from our Raw Materials segment were slightly better than we anticipated. It is worth noting that our second quarter results included $20.5 million of pre-operating and start-up costs related to strategic investment projects, compared with $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2019 and approximately $6 million in the year-ago quarter.","First half 2019 cash provided from operations was approximately $1.2 billion, up from about $870 million for the year-ago period. Inventories and receivables were a source of approximately $400 million in the first half, reflecting consistent working capital management in a declining price environment.","Our capital spending accelerated in the second quarter and totaled $650 million so far this year. We have received our permits for the Gallatin expansion, so between that and other projects that we have in our pipeline, we expect to increase CapEx further in the second half and approach our budgeted amount of approximately $1.8 billion for the full-year.","With respect to cash return to shareholders during the second quarter, we paid dividends of $123 million and stock repurchases totaled $125 million. Thus far, in 2019, we returned 50% of our net income to our shareholders, while also investing for long-term profitable growth. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash on hand.","Nucor's financial condition remains strong with total debt outstanding of $4.2 billion. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 28% at the end of the second quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023. Our next material debt maturity is in 2022 for approximately $600 million.","Now turning to the outlook. Earnings in the third quarter of 2019 are expected to be lower than the second quarter. Inventory destocking, especially by service center customers has led to declining results year-to-date and our muted expectations for the next quarter. While we are encouraged by recent upturns in the prices for flat-rolled steel products, and as John mentioned, we do continue to see healthy demand for our major end-use markets.","We finished the second quarter with much lower margins in sheet and plate steel and believe that margin recovery could take some time. We therefore, expect weaker linked quarter performance in the Steel Mills segment again, primarily reflecting reduced margins for both sheet and plate steel. However, we do expect that service center customers will resume more normal buying patterns in the third quarter.","The Steel Products segment is expected to achieve further profitability improvement in the third quarter over the second quarter. Non-residential construction activity remains strong and we believe some incremental demand has likely shifted to later in the year due to difficult weather conditions during the first several months of 2019.","Recent initiatives to improve the performance of our rebar fabrication and metal buildings businesses are also expected to continue to favorably impact results for the Steel Products segment.","The performance of our Raw Materials segment is expected to decline in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, due to further margin pressure at our direct reduced iron or DRI plants. In addition, later this quarter, we will begin our plan 65-day outage at Nucor Steel Louisiana to complete major enhancements to the physical plant.","Thank you for your interest in our Company. I will now turn the call back over to John.","John Ferriola","Thanks, Jim. Before we take your questions, I would like to acknowledge a significant milestone that Nucor teammates at our Darlington, South Carolina bar mill recently celebrated. As many of you know, Darlington is the first steel mill Nucor built. Back in the mid-1960s, our founder Ken Iverson decided that Nucor needed to be able to supply its own steel for its joist operations in Florence, South Carolina.","Nucor selected EAF Technology for Darlington and took the first step in leading the transformation of the domestic steel industry that has occurred over the past 50 years. We celebrated this 50-year run at Darlington on June 26. Darlington continues to be a strong contributor to Nucor\u2019s profitability and a valued member of its community. We look forward to another 50 years of success at Darlington.","In closing, I would like to say thank you to our more than 26,000 teammates for the way you execute our strategy, and thank you for the work that you do every day to build a safer and more profitable Nucor.","I would also like to say thank you to our customers. We appreciate the trust you place in Nucor and we will continue to do our very best to earn it with every order. And finally, thank you to our investors for entrusting us with your valuable capital.","We would now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Martin Englert with Jefferies.","Martin Englert","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon.","Martin Englert","Within the raw materials, you pointed towards the lower sequential results into 3Q and further margin compression in DRI. Do you expect the overall segment to remain profitable and could you also talk about your material sourcing strategy given the upcoming, I think, you said it was a 65-day outage, correct?","James Frias","We don't disclose specifically which business units are going to be profitable, but overall we expect the Raw Material segment to be profitable. And John, do you want to talk about\u2026","John Ferriola","I'll address some of the other issues. You mentioned about sourcing. We have several sources. You know, that there's some challenges in the iron ore marketplace right now, but we have solid secured deliveries coming in. We're not worried about that. Pricing is a bit of a challenge right now because of some of the things that are going on, but we feel good about the rest of it being able to get what we need and when we need it.","James Frias","I think the sourcing question is about us getting something to replace the DRI for our melt shops.","John Ferriola","Is that what you're looking for Martin?","Martin Englert","Yes. More along the lines. While you have this outage of even pre-building any DRI pellet inventory or you importing any prime scrap, I guess. So what's the strategy there?","John Ferriola","We've built some inventory, but you know, we have \u2013 one of the great things about our raw material strategy overall is the flexibility of it. And we have the DJ Joseph team that's been able to go frankly, globally to secure any scrap that we need, you know prime or obsolete.","We have great sources of HPI that we can bring in, again from David J. Joseph, and we have great sources of pig iron that we can bring in. So we are not at all concerned about being able to get the virgin iron units that we need to maintain, producing the ultra-high-strength steels during this period of outage from the DRI plants.","Martin Englert","Okay, excellent. Thanks for the color there. And if I could one other quick follow-up. There have been several recent flat-rolled price increases introduced. Can you discuss how that's been received by the market and any change in the order book since that was introduced?","John Ferriola","Well, there's been two that have been introduced. The first one was maybe was three weeks ago \u2013 three weeks ago and we were able \u2013 it's $40 and we were able to get all $40 of that $40. The second one was just about a week ago, and it's really too early to tell too much about how much we'll get of that $40, but the initial week looks encouraging. We're also encouraged by the fact that as a result of these increases, we've seen an increase in the volume of our orders coming in, also for all three of our hot band cold-rolled and galvanized products.","Martin Englert","Okay, very encouraging. Thank you very much.","Operator","And next we'll go to Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners","Yes. Hey, good afternoon, everyone.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon.","Timna Tanners","So I wanted to ask about some of the capacity coming on in 2020 is replacing some of the domestic supplies, specifically if you look at U.S. Steel Fairfield mill and if you look at JSW's Baytown plate mill. Now I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts about how that can affect the market and if Nucor is a supplier on any of those \u2013 to any of those mills on raw materials or semi-finished product.","John Ferriola","Okay. Let's start with the semi-finished product since you asked that question about JSW coming online and U.S. Steel. We have been supplying both of those companies, but as a result of that, we've built a pretty good product line of round billets and blooms that we can sell to the entire market, and we recognize that at least at this point in time, we're being told that we will lose that business in the next couple of years.","We have been building a customer base outside of those two and we've been securing contracts with other customers. So we're confident that we'll be able to replace the tons from U.S. Steel and from JSW with other customers as they pull their business away from us.","Timna Tanners","Okay, that's helpful. Go ahead.","John Ferriola","Go ahead, I\u2019m done.","Timna Tanners","All right. So the second question I had was regarding the steel downstream business, so steel products. You succeeded in having improved profitability there as you had anticipated quarter-over-quarter, but when I look year-over-year, it's still below last year's levels, and I'm just confused as to how to think about that.","The rule of thumb I had in mind was that when you have rising steel prices, generally steel products lag, but in a declining steel price environment, one would think that margins can maybe be higher year-over-year. So maybe if you could correct me if I'm wrong about that or how to think about what the right normal profitability is or how to think about what that trend can be going forward?","John Ferriola","When you look at the total downstream, I'm assuming, you're including tube in that generalization, correct?","James Frias","Yes.","Timna Tanners","Yes. I'm just looking EBIT per ton of the segment..","John Ferriola","Yes. So when you look at tube, that's really been what's pulling down the downstream business. The tubular business right now - our tubular business right now is suffering from some of the same things that we've seen on the steel side, bloated inventories in the service centers have resulted in lower orders that, of course, drives the price down, that of course drives margins down.","So this is in our opinion, this is a result of a too high of an inventory build during last year and the aggressive destocking that you see not only in our steel products, but also in tubes. So that's probably the biggest impact on our downstream business not doing as well as we anticipated and not doing as well as we did last year.","Timna Tanners","So potential for that to still normalize once inventory levels normalize in those end markets. Is that what we should think about or any way to think conceptually about what that looks like normally?","John Ferriola","Yes, I think that, you know, if this is a question of what's really driving the volume reductions in tubular and in our steel. Overall, we believe that the issue is too much inventory in the system that has to work its way through and that at the time that it goes through. You have to remember when you talk about tubular, 80% of the tubular was sold through service centers. So this really impacts \u2013 this issue of inventory, really impacts the tubular business, but it's also true of our steel business as we've talked about many times in the past.","Inventories do not necessarily \u2013 service center shipments do not necessarily indicate what's happening with true end-use demand. We believe that end-use demand is still very strong and we see that in our order entry rate for OEMs versus our order entry rate for service centers.","When you look at our order entry rates for OEMs, we're actually up in the first half by about 4% compared to the three-year average, whereas if you look at order entry for service centers we\u2019re down 14% compared to the three-year average. So that's a pretty good indicator to us that end demand is still pretty strong. Of course, we talk to our customers who are basically telling us the same thing and I'm speaking in general now both of steel and our tubular products also.","Timna Tanners","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank.","Christopher Terry","Hi, John and Jim. Couple of questions from me. Just in terms of the volume, you mentioned that second half volume should be more in line with real demand. Have you seen any marked pickup, I guess, in July in the service center [borrowing] [ph], and how do we think about maybe second half on first half of this year, maybe second half on the second half of last year? Thanks.","John Ferriola","Well, I'll start with just general comments, and Jim you can comment on the year-over-year performance and half-over-half performance. I mentioned earlier that after the first $40 a ton increase in sheet price, we did see a pickup in our order for our sheet products and that came for both OEM customers, but also from our service centers.","When we meet with our service centers, we talk about what they will think is going to happen in the second half, they feel that the demand, end demand for their products will be steady and still strong. They talk about the need for making sure that they get their inventories completely now, which is what they're striving to accomplish.","But one of the things that we're seeing also that should be a good indicator of moving in and it's early in the game. So I don't want to be too overconfident here, but we are cautiously optimistic and we hit the bottom on pricing and on volumes. We see our lead times are beginning to stretch out a little bit. Whenever that starts to happen that encourages the service centers to come back into the market.","Now with the OEMs, it's more of a steady state situation. So after the $40 a ton increase, we believe that that represented the bottom of the market service centers. Whenever you see pricing start to go up, they come back into the market. So we think that that bodes well for the second half of the year and we'll see how it plays out.","James Frias","And relative to your question about the second half of this year versus last year, obviously we don't give guidance for the half year. We're saying third quarter can be down because of where margins are at having bottomed recently and what we see going forward. But from a volume perspective, we certainly saw destocking began in the second half of last year and then carry into 2019.","And there'll always be a seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter, but we would expect right now and this is a long short guess that volumes in the fourth quarter of this year should be better than last year because we don't expect to see the destocking component in the fourth quarter, we'll just see the normal seasonal slowdown that we would expect.","John Ferriola","I think if I can just build on that a minute, because I think it's important to think about what took place in 2018 as it related to the 232 and everything that was going on. First of all, if you go all the way back to 2017, with tax reform and deregulation, that was really a shot in the arm of manufacturing. And frankly, the order entry rate picked up, demand for steel picked up, and it was growing all through 2017, towards the end of 2017, but particularly in the beginning of 2018, a lot of our customers were reading about the fact that when the tariffs came into effect, they would not be able to get the steel that they needed to fill their customers orders.","That created somewhat of a panic of both with our OEM and with our service center customers. They were convinced that the domestic capacity would not be enough to supply all the needs that they had to keep their customers happy. But as it played out, 232 came into effect. The imports did go down and domestic capacity was enabled, was, in fact, able to start up again and fill the need.","But during that time when they were afraid of getting not being able get the steel, they put their inventories to very high levels, and of course, domestic capacity came on, everything settled down, the order rate and pricing returned to more normalized levels, but they maintained this high inventory. At the end of the year, they want to get rid of that overblown inventory, they began to aggressively destock.","So what happens then, okay, they destock \u2013 the volumes coming into the mills, go down. Pricing results, as a result, goes down. And the next thing you know, we get into this spiral of \u2013 in fact, the aggressive destocking was so intense that was the end of last year and into the first half of this year where service center is selling to other service centers.","So it became a very difficult situation and as always happens in our business, we always do things. Now we think that we're getting to the point where the inventories are down to the normal levels and we expect to see more normalized ordering rates in the next quarter.","Christopher Terry","Thank you. Thanks for the color. Just one quick follow-up. In terms of the end markets, you talked about the two-thirds that you\u2019re cautiously optimistic around, the other third I assume that is that related to orders or what is that market or which markets are those specifically that you're still working out? Thanks.","John Ferriola","We think that automotive is going to be down about 2%, so that's one of the markets that we would say is weakening as we go into the second half of 2019. That said, our market share within automotive continues to grow. So there'll be a small pie and we'll have a larger piece of that smaller pie. So the impact will be less felt by Nucor and others in our space.","Another one that I remember being looking from a chart that was down would be power transmission. There was a whole bunch of power transmission projects that were wrapped up at the end of 2018. So power transmission is an industry that we expect to be down also. Agriculture will be down a little bit as we see it going forward into this second half of this year also.","Christopher Terry","Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Matt Korn with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Korn","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. So early this week, the White House announced some revisions to these Buy American requirements. I was wondering how much if any potential incremental effect do you see from these changes? I ask because our understanding had been that many of these public projects already had very high thresholds from melt and import U.S. Steel, but the administration appears to believe that there were loopholes that limited the effectiveness of those rules. I'm wondering what your view is?","John Ferriola","Well, there was some loopholes and there we're pleased to see those loopholes being closed. And you're right, a lot of the regulations already were in place that it was a Buy American and we want to make sure we did stress the point that this was Buy American meant, melted, poured and rolled in the United States.","So we took a little bit on a loophole away from that was existing. So in general, we'll see some impact. We do supply to the militaries, particularly out of our plate group and out of our SBQ group. So it's a positive impact to us but it is not a major impact.","Matthew Korn","Got it. Thanks. And then to continue as you kind of go around the product groups here, there's been a lot of focus on hot-rolled coils, some focus on downstream, what's happening in the plate market in your view? Your volumes are off, prices they're off, they have dropped to the 7.50 level. Is that two way function pronounced destocking or is there true demand challenges occurring for that particular product?","John Ferriola","There's two impact that have occurred there on plate. First of all, you need to think about the weather conditions that we endured during the first half of this year, particularly in the first quarter. A lot of plate products go into bridges and so forth. Projects that you have to have good weather and wanted to be able to see, so there's a lot of projects that are on the books, but we haven't been able to move forward with them, simply because of the extreme weather conditions.","The other impact is, as you mentioned, aggressive destocking. Just as we said with the \u2013 products earlier with tubular and with sheet products, the same occurred with plates. Inventory levels got way too high at the end of 2018 and we began the destocking program, and a little bit of a time delay on that one simply because of plate tends to trail hot band by about two months, three months in terms of both volumes and pricing. So it's a little bit of a time delay, but basically the same scenario played out in plate that we described earlier.","Matthew Korn","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we'll go to Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Philip Gibbs","Hey, good afternoon.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon.","Philip Gibbs","I was reading last night that one of your mill competitors in the North American sheet market, Arcelor, has formally asked its U.S. mill suppliers for concessions and price cuts. Question is, are you either seeking pricing concessions from your mills suppliers or seeing any softness in inputs like electrodes and refractory, alloys or mill services?","John Ferriola","Well, electrodes we can talk about in a minute, because that's a more specific issue, and we do see actually price going down in electrodes a little bit of about 7% this year over last year. But that's a very specific issue. There was a run up in electrodes over the last couple of years that was unsustainable and we're seeing it start to work its way down.","But in general, I respond to your question, first of all, Nucor is a high integrity company. We honor all the contracts that we have and we will not go out and demand any price reductions on contracts that we have signed and the firm numbers are in place.","That said, if our suppliers do in fact offer our competitors better pricing, we will go and talk to them about that, we will not demand it, but what we might find is largest steel producer in the United States, we buy a whole lot more of everything than anyone else. And if they treat us any differently than our competition, we'll remember that when those contracts that we have come to an end and we talk about who we do business with in 2020. Does that answer your question?","Philip Gibbs","Yes, absolutely. And in terms of some of the stuff that was more the other things that were impacted by, I think, the China supply side issues like refractories and alloys, what are you seeing there?","John Ferriola","Refractories, they're still pretty high. We haven't seen much of a reduction in that. Our alloys are still running pretty high, not quite up to the 2018 levels because just like everything else with steel, less steel that we're producing, the less alloys need unless refractory needs to be replaced. So the volumes go down and pricing comes down a little bit, that's more volume related than anything else.","Philip Gibbs","And John, I think at your Investor Day, you talked about 17 growing markets and 7 were either flat or declining. Is that mix still the same now or has it changed?","John Ferriola","It's pretty much the same. ","Philip Gibbs","And if I could sneak in one more\u2026","John Ferriola","Okay, one more.","Philip Gibbs","Just in term \u2013 it should be a short one. Just in terms of your outlook for scrap in August? Thanks.","John Ferriola","Well, I'll speak to \u2013 how about if I speak to the outlook for scrap over the entire third quarter, because it's pretty tough to get definitive into one given month, because we see the third quarter scrap pricing, we see it up $20 to $30 somewhere in that neighborhood and we don't think it's going to describe walkout out of control but we do think over the quarter would be a $20 to $30.","We think that a pig iron will probably up somewhere in the neighborhood of $10 to $15. We're seeing some of that price reflected in the latest offers that we're getting. So $20 to $30 for scrap and somewhere maybe $10 to $15 on pig iron.","Philip Gibbs","Thanks so much.","Operator","And next we'll go to David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets.","David Gagliano","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A lot of them have already been answered. I just have two follow-up for clarifications. First of all, on the volumes for the third quarter, I'm still a little confused. Do you expect volumes overall in the third quarter to be up or down sequentially?","John Ferriola","It's hard to project. Right now, as we mentioned a couple of times, we're in a transition. We're in the cusp of the transition from a situation of severe to down destocking to more normalized order entry rate from our service centers. Not being a service center ourselves, we don't know just exactly where those inventories are.","Rather than say, we know exactly what's going to happen with volumes going into the third quarter, I would say that we're going to transition, how quickly it ramps back up will determine how our third quarter volumes look relative to our second quarter.","I think the important point to remember is this. We are seeing the transition and it's going back up. We see lead times expanding, and really important point here that allows me to sleep easily at night is that our end demand is still very strong and user demand remains very strong. If we didn't see that through our OEM customers, I'd be a whole lot more worried about what the rest of the year was going to look like than I am right now.","David Gagliano","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up. Flagged about $21 million, I think, start-up costs that were in the second quarter numbers. My question is what are the expectations moving forward for start-up costs?","James Frias","We think it's going to be in the $25 million range in Q3.","David Gagliano","And any big difference in Q4?","James Frias","It's hard to say, probably not too much.","David Gagliano","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Ferriola for any additional or closing remarks.","John Ferriola","Thank you, David. I'll close by signing off by saying again, I want to express our appreciation to our shareholders. We value your contribution and capital investment in our Company and we will treat it with great care. I want to say thank you to our customers for building our capabilities to better serve you. We believe that together we can build powerful partnerships for powerful results.","And finally to my Nucor teammates, thank you for what you're doing for Nucor every day. Most importantly, thank you for doing it safely. Thanks for your interest in Nucor. Have a great day.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","Certain statements made during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Although Nucor believes they are based on reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that future events will not affect their accuracy. More information about the risk and uncertainties relating to these forward-looking statements may be found in Nucor's latest 10-K and subsequently filed 10-Qs, which are available on the SEC's and Nucor's websites.

Please go ahead, sir.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Thank you, Marissa. Good afternoon. Again, this is Dan DiMicco, Nucor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you for joining us for our conference call today. And as always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team: Our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Ferriola; Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey over our Long Products group; Keith Grass over our Scrap and Raw Materials group; Ladd Hall over our Flat-Rolled and DRI group; Ham Lott over our Downstream Fabricated Products; and Joe Stratman, heading up Business Development and our Plate & Beam business.","First, and most importantly, I want to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin and Steel Technologies teams for their excellent work in an economic environment that remained extremely challenging in 2011. Together, we are continuing to deliver on our goal of taking care of our customers. We define our customers as our fellow teammates, the people who buy and use our products, and our shareholders who trust us to provide attractive returns on their capital invested in Nucor. Thank you, all.","Earnings increased almost sixfold in 2011 to $778 million from 2010's net income of $134 million. This improvement was achieved despite severely depressed nonresidential construction markets which, in 2011, remained more than 60% below the peak level reached in 2007. How did our team accomplish this performance? Nucor's superior competitive position with our unrivaled financial strength, product diversification and operational flexibility, which allows us to grow during the periods -- to grow stronger during the periods of economic distress. ","In 2011, we were able to expand our participation in markets, enjoying more robust demand which you'll hear more about later. Throughout our company, the more than 20,000 men and women of Nucor are enjoying outstanding success developing new products, reducing costs and improving quality across Nucor's entire product portfolio. ","What do I mean when I say that our team is building a stronger Nucor? By a stronger Nucor, I'm describing one position to deliver higher highs and higher lows in earnings power throughout successful economic cycles. That type of performance has a long tradition at Nucor and one we plan on continuing. The most recent example being the investments we made last year that were major contributors to a sixfold increase in cyclical peak earnings from $311 million in 2000, to more than $1.8 billion in 2008.","And the Nucor team's work growing long-term earnings power and shareholder value is ongoing. Over the 2008 through 2012 period, Nucor will have invested more than $6 billion of capital, with a disciplined execution of our 5-pronged growth strategy. The bottom line is that Nucor is primed and ready for new higher highs in earnings once the sustainable economic recovery inevitably arrives. ","In 2012, we expect to see continued growth in sales and earnings for Nucor, albeit in a slow-growth U.S. economy, burdened by a challenging regulatory and overall business environment. Uncertainties in Europe's financial sector will weigh on both global and U.S. growth in 2012. But in short, we are cautiously optimistic for the year coming up. ","Fortunately, there are solutions to the serious problems threatening our nation's economic well-being, a move back to creating, making and building things as the major driver of our economy's growth, and the growth of the American middle class is long overdue. The idea that a service-dominated economy alone can provide substantial wealth creation is a hugely failed business model that's proven over and over again in the last 20 years. It has given us ill-advised government policies, and financial sector business practices that have created one economic bubble after another, culminating with the great financial collapse and panic of 2008 that is still with us today. The U.S.-based manufacturing holds the key to reinvigorated growth for our country in the years and decades to come. ","The time is right, the opportunity is here for us to seize and the path forward is clear, and the naysayers should go back into their closets. New opportunities in energy infrastructure and rebuilding our infrastructure, revitalizing our manufacturing sector, are shouting out to us as the path forward for future generations of Americans that have the opportunity earn a rising standard of living. This is the path that will create the 30 million net jobs we need over the next 5 to 7 years, while rebuilding our economy, our tax base, our middle class and our global competitiveness. We at Nucor, working together with our partners in the domestic and multinational manufacturing community, are applying our can-do attitude and energy level to shine a bright light on this exciting path forward.","I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to discuss our fourth quarter and year-end results. Following Jim's comments, President and CEO, John Ferriola, will report on our operations and the implementation of our current growth initiatives. Jim?","James D. Frias","Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. Fourth quarter 2011 earnings of $0.43 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.22 to $0.27 per diluted share. A portion of that outperformance resulted from a lower-than-expected LIFO charge and 2 nonrecurring items. The quarter's LIFO charge of $52 million was approximately $27 million less than the estimate used in our mid-December guidance. A noncash gain of $29 million was recognized in the fourth quarter for the correction of an actuarial calculation related to the medical plan covering certain eligible early retirees. And our equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates included a favorable year-end tax adjustment of approximately $7 million. Together, these items increased fourth quarter earnings by about $0.13 per diluted share. Excluding the effect of these items earnings still exceeded our fourth quarter guidance range. ","Nucor's fourth quarter performance benefited from stronger-than-expected volumes and margins in December. The fourth quarter 2011 effective tax rate, measured as a percent of earnings before taxes and noncontrolling interest, was 29.4%. After adjusting out profits belonging to our noncontrolling interest business partners, the effective tax rate was 32.5%. Full year 2011 earnings per diluted share of $2.45 represent significant improvement from 2010 earnings of $0.42. Nucor's return on equity for 2011 was 11%, a respectable level for a year in which our Steel Mill capacity utilization rate was only 74% in continuing depressed market conditions. Our returns were achieved with the lowest financial leverage in the industry. ","While construction remains our largest end-use market, Nucor's 2011 profit improvement reflects our company's unrivaled product diversification and initial returns from our ongoing strategy to grow long-term earnings power. It goes back to Dan's point, that our team uses economic downturns as opportunities to grow stronger. Emerging from downturns stronger than we entered them is how we build long-term value for our shareholders. We get stronger because our financial strength allows us to invest in attractive growth opportunities through the economic cycle.","Nucor, again, generated healthy cash flow with cash provided by the operating activities of more than $1 billion in 2011. Regarding the cash flow generating capacity of our expanding platforms and the Steel Products business, here's a noteworthy statistic. Through the current downturn, average annual cash generated from operations from 2009 through 2011, more than doubled the amount generated during the last downturn from 2001 through 2003. Our growth strategy's objective is higher-highs and higher-lows in the returns achieved through successive business cycles. ","Cash, short-term investments and restricted cash totaled over $3.1 billion at the end of 2011. Restricted cash of $586 million is available to fund a significant portion of the DRI plant we're building in Louisiana. Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, in December, we increased the size of our unsecured revolving credit facility by $200 million to $1.5 billion. The facility is undrawn and does not mature until December 2016. We have no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt totaled $4.3 billion at the end of 2011. We expect our leverage to decline as a result of upcoming long-term debt maturities of $650 million this year and $250 million in 2013. Our plan is to fund these maturities by drawing from our healthy liquidity position and continued strong operating cash flow.","Nucor has earned the highest credit rating awarded to any metals and mining company in North America, an Aa2 rating from Moody's and an A rating from Standard & Poor's. Our company is the only steel producer in North America to enjoy the very important competitive advantage of an investment grade rating. To that point, Standard & Poor's, in their January 9 report entitled, North American Metals and Mining Companies, Strongest to Weakest, again ranked new Nucor #1 for credit rating and credit outlook among the universe of 68 companies. Nucor was also the only metals and mining company in the group that S&P awarded a strong business risk profile due to our competitive position and profit performance relative to our peers.","In 2012, we are continuing to invest in projects that will grow our long-term earnings power and provide attractive returns to our shareholders. We project 2012 capital spending of approximately $1 billion or more than double the 2011 capital spending of $441 million. 2012's capital spending at our Louisiana DRI project is expected to increase to approximately $450 million from about $50 million in 2011. John Ferriola will review additional exciting growth projects that we will initiate in 2012.","In addition to allowing us to invest in attractive growth opportunities, Nucor's strong financial position and cash flow generation has enabled our company to build an impressive record of cash dividends paid to our shareholders and total shareholder return. In December, Nucor's Board of Directors increased our regular or base dividend for the 39th consecutive year. Reflecting the Nucor's team success in growing long-term earnings power, the base quarterly dividend has increased approximately tenfold over the past 11 years. Further, during that same time period, Nucor has delivered a total return of 464%. Let me repeat that. Over that 11-year period, Nucor has delivered a total shareholder return of 464%. That compares with 174% for the Standard & Poor's Steel Group Index and 4% for the S&P 500. ","For the first quarter of 2012, we expect earnings to improve from the fourth quarter 2011 level, after adjusting for the onetime benefits received in the fourth quarter. Several end-use markets such as automotive, heavy equipment, energy, and general manufacturing have continued to experience improvement in demand, benefiting SBQ, sheet and plate products in particular. We're also seeing small but encouraging signs of improvement in our construction products businesses.","Nucor will, again, follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance around the middle of the final month of the quarter. We are excited by the opportunities we see ahead to reward our shareholders with very attractive long-term returns. Our competitive advantages will continue to be the flexibility, diversification and sustainability found in Nucor's business model. Thank you for your interest in Nucor. Dan?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Thank you, Jim. I'll now ask John Ferriola to report on Nucor's operations. John?","John J. Ferriola","Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. Let me begin by thanking all of our raw material, steelmaking and steel product teammates for your outstanding commitment to working safely and to taking care of Nucor's customers. I am always inspired when I visit our operations and see firsthand the impressive work you are doing to profitably grow our businesses for the long term. You are Nucor's most powerful competitive advantage, the right people, living our culture every day. Thank you, and please, keep it up.","Dan and Jim both discussed the value of Nucor's business model. Our business model, with its flexibility, diversification and sustainability is why Nucor is in an unrivaled position of strength, and taking advantage of our strengths is how we expect to continue delivering industry-leading through-the-cycle return on capital performance. Our 2011 results, again, highlight the bottom line benefits we gain from Nucor being North America's most diversified steel and steel products manufacturer. Impressive year-over-year profit growth was achieved by our plate mills and our bar mills. Also contributing solid 2011 profitable growth were our sheet mill, beam, deck, cold- finished bar and scrap businesses. Our diverse and growing product portfolio, combined with our operational flexibility, is allowing us to grow our presence in end-use markets such as automotive, heavy equipment, energy and general manufacturing; markets that are currently enjoying more robust growth.","Our 2011 performance demonstrated another compelling aspect of the Nucor story. Our company has a proven track record of using our strong balance sheet and cash flow to prepare for the good times during the bad times. Many of the investments we have made during the current downturn are already paying off for us. Here are some examples. The newest additions to our bar mill group, our special bar quality mill in Memphis, Tennessee; and our wire rod and rebar bar mill in Kingman, Arizona, both achieved profitability last year. Our Hertford County, North Carolina plate mill's new heat-treat line has been sold out since March of 2011. We are growing our presence in higher-margin products where higher strength, abrasion resistance and greater toughness are required. ","The heat-treat line has also allowed us to improve the product mix allocation between our 2 plate mills and 4 sheet mills, which enabled us to improve margins at those facilities. And more value-added plate products are on the way, with the vacuum tank degasser and normalizing line currently being installed at Hertford County. Our Nebraska SBQ mill's new quality assurance line was completed in 2011 and is already providing us growth opportunities in higher-margin SBQ products. Our downstream businesses, including rebar fabrication, joist, deck and pre-engineered metal buildings, continued to grow their long-term earnings power in 2011, by expanding both their geographical footprint and their product offerings. Our David J. Joseph team expanded their overall footprint and also grew their nonferrous metals sortation capacity.","Looking ahead, we see more extremely attractive opportunities to continue growing Nucor's long-term earnings power. In December, our board approved projects totaling $290 million at our Tennessee, Nebraska and South Carolina SBQ mills that will expand Nucor's SBQ and wire rod capacity by 1 million tons. These investments position Nucor to meet the growing needs of our engineered bar customers in a number of attractive markets that include automotive, energy, heavy truck and heavy equipment. We expect to complete each of these projects by the end of 2013, subject to regulatory approvals.","Nucor continues to grow our value-added capabilities in the sheet market. At our Hickman, Arkansas sheet mill, we are installing a vacuum degasser. As the westernmost flat-rolled facility in the United States with a vacuum degasser, Hickman will be strategically positioned to take advantage of the growing markets of the Southwest United States and Mexico. The degasser should be operating by the end of this year. At our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill, capital has been approved to allow the facility to produce wider and lighter gauge hot rolled sheet steel. With the planned modifications, Berkeley will be able to produce a 74-inch wide hot band, with the downstream products such as pickled and oiled, and cold-rolled being produced at a finished width of 72 inches. We will also be sending cold-rolled output from our Berkeley facility to our Decatur, Alabama sheet mill to produce 72-inch wide galvanized sheet steel. This wide, light project at Berkeley will enhance the ability of the entire Nucor Sheet Mill Group to continue to move up the value chain in flat-rolled markets.","I am also pleased to report that our Louisiana DRI project is proceeding on schedule. The full management team is in place and construction is well underway. Startup is expected in mid-2013. Completion of the first 2.5 million tons per year module in Louisiana, combined with our existing DRI plant in Trinidad, will bring us to about 2\/3 of our goal to control from 6 million to 7 million tons of annual capacity in high-quality scrap substitutes.","In summary, our team's unrelenting focus remains on long-term sustainable growth in Nucor's profitability. Thank you for your interest in our company. Dan?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Thank you, John. I want to again thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David Joseph, Duferdofin and Steel Technologies teams for working safely, working hard, working smart and working together. You are the reason that I could say with the greatest confidence that Nucor's best is yet to come.","Before moving on to questions, I would like to read a favorite quote of mine. \"Some people make things happen. Some people watch things happen. Other people wonder what happened. The rest often criticize those that make things happen. Be part of the solution, not part of the problem. Remember, this is your world. Shape it or someone else will.\" We would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sohail Tharani with Goldman Sachs.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Dan, couple of questions. First, on the DRI. When you planned this project last year, you had mentioned about locking in natural gas price at a very good price. Since then natural gas prices have collapsed further and I was wondering if that mechanism allows you to renegotiate the index of the market price so that your costs also will go down if the natural gas price does remain low by the time this project starts.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, we're not locked in to a financial instrument. We are actually involved in drilling and in a joint venture partnership. And the cost per unit million BTU of natural gas, as we are producing it and where pricing is today, does not put us at a competitive disadvantage.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. The second question is, a comment in your press release about scrap flat to down. I thought that the scrap was up in, actually, January. Is it the flow scrap that you have a 1-month lag that's currently down because you'll be using the December scrap in January?","James D. Frias","Well, we always do have a lag between our purchase of scrap and when it shows up in our production of steel. And you're right, we are saying that scrap will be down moderately as we go into February, driven by, we've had a pretty mild winter and Nucor has made some pretty strategic overseas buys, which will be arriving in the February timeframe. But we do expect, longer term, scrap pricing to rebound, probably in the March timeframe. Because at the end of the day, it's still winter, steel mill production is still steady and the dollar is depreciating. So short term, we see sideways to moderately down. Longer term, we see it rebounding.","Operator","Our next question comes from Luke Folta with Jefferies.","Luke Folta - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","John, you made a comment about being able to make 72-inch bands at Berkeley and I was hoping you could maybe give some more color on what the significance of that is and what markets that puts you in and how that changes your exposure there.","John J. Ferriola","Well, first of all, just to get the facts straight. We will be making 74-inch of hot band at Berkeley. The finished product, downstream cold-rolled and galvanized will be coming off at 72-inch. Obviously, that opens up many opportunities for us in the market, particularly in appliances and in automotive. The wider product is required for automotive applications, as you get further into the value-added products up to and including exposed automotive. Also it gives us some advantages in our pipe and tube markets as you can have a wider product with more slits and brings more value to the customer. I should also point out, let me point out that you referenced the width, but don't discard the fact that we will be making a lighter gauge. We'll be able to have extra additional strength, which also gives us new applications in automotive and in other areas also. So the lighter gauge, the extra mill stand will give us higher strength product to bring into the market.","Luke Folta - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then just on the SBQ press release that was out yesterday, it sounds like it's an additional 1 million tons. I shouldn't read that -- first, I shouldn't read that as additional steelmaking capacity, it seems like it's more downstream or finishing capacity. And then also, can you give us a sense of, does this -- I mean, is this basically more of the same products you're producing or does this put you in a different part of that market as well?","John J. Ferriola","Okay, first of all, it will be additional capacity that we will be producing. I want to be very clear about this. As we bring additional SBQ capacity online in our facilities, we will not be surrendering or abandoning any of our merchant or rebar products or customers. So it will be additional capacity. And it really isn't just more of the same. Many of the projects that we will be doing over the next 2 years will get us in to new products. We're basically expanding our size range and our grade range. The wide block and line upgrading [ph] in South Carolina and in our Darlington facility will allow us to expand our size range in Darlington. In Nebraska, we'll be adding a fifth strand which gives us more volume. But our Nebraska mill has a pretty good diversified grade mix as it stands and they have been doing extremely well in the market. They've qualified in most of our customers that use SBQ products. And Memphis will also be adding a fourth strand, and we're adding advanced testing equipment, which will allow us to get into the even higher-valued, more critical applications of SBQ.","Daniel R. DiMicco","I'd like to add to that, that you have to distinguish between additional capacity that is being generated from existing facilities versus building new facilities, and we're not talking about building completely new steelmaking facilities. Our capital cost per ton of increased production here is going to be somewhere underneath $290 a ton versus what it would cost to build a $1-million facility that would be north of $600 a ton for this type of product that we're producing. So this is really becoming more efficient at our existing operations, taking full advantage of the equipment that we have in place and putting mass [ph] equipment in to allow not only for more production capability in these types of products, but also expanded market products and different products than we're producing today. And it's important that you understand that we define a market, and how people define markets may be different from one another because we define the market for this type of product, that includes not only special bar quality rounds, but also forging stock and also stock for pipe finishing operations, seamless pipe finishing operations as well. John, do you want to add anything more to that?","John J. Ferriola","Yes, I would add maybe 2 points. One is that, sticking with our focus on having diversity, the products that we will be adding, the 1 million tons that we will be adding, are spread out across many markets, many industries and many customers. So it will not be concentrated in any 1 market, industry or any 1 customer base creating an over-capacity situation. The other thing I'd like to point out, Dan, is that as the second-largest SBQ supplier in the United States, we have firmly established ourselves with our customer base. We've qualified on most of the critical applications and we're in a good position to follow up on that with additional tons into those same customers and those same markets that we've already qualified on at our mills.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Can you just help us, with everything you've got going on what should we be modeling for pre-operating startup costs for 2012?","James D. Frias","This is Jim Frias. This year, there were about $21 million in the fourth quarter, $20.8 million is what's in the earnings release. In the first quarter, we think they're going to be a similar level and eventually they're going to ramp up because of the new DRI facility, but it's too early for us to tell what those are going to be. So we'll give you quarter-by-quarter what we're looking at, okay?","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And secondly, just with all the new investment. You've got the wide coated sheet, light gauge sheet, you've got DRI coming up, you've got SBQ, you've got the degasser going in. Automotive and appliance just seems like such a natural market for all of this. Can you talk about what your percentage of your business would be in that end market today and what it might be come 2014?","John J. Ferriola","Well, right now, we're at about 10% of our sheet product goes into automotive. Another couple of percent going into appliances. In our SBQ market, about 5% to 10% also of our SBQ products go into those 2 markets currently. Frankly, with the additions that we're making in our SBQ portfolio and what we're adding to our sheet portfolio, we expect that to grow.","Daniel R. DiMicco","We're also doing about 10% to 15% in the energy sector with respect to our SBQ-quality product.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","It seems like a lot of this is coming up over the 2013 period. So I'm just trying to get sense of how important those markets might be to you in 2014 or around that point.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, they'll obviously be very important because the direction that we're heading here with this additional capacity and our continual movement up the value chain, whether it be in sheets or bar or plate, the heavy equipment sectors, the energy sectors, the automotive, the appliance sector, but in particularly the automotive, will be very important and we'll be able to continue to participate at greater levels and greater percentages with our current growth strategy and with capital that we're going to be spending over the next couple of years in each of those markets, as those markets continue to improve as the economy recovers.","John J. Ferriola","Dan, I might just add to that, that just so we're clear. This isn't something new that we're moving into. We've been in the automotive market for several years now, probably going on almost 10 years. And our presence in that market, both from a product diversity, value-added and customer base has been growing every year. So we're ready for this next step. We're excited about this next step. Going to the 74-inch substrate at Berkeley is a big advantage for us moving forward. The other thing I'd point out, Dan, is what this does for us as a company is provide even more diversification, allowing us to take more products across more customers and more industries. So we're continuing to diversify.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Last question, if I could. Just with the RG this past quarter, how much tonnage do you think you picked up from that? How much do you think you can retain going forward?","Daniel R. DiMicco","We're not going to comment on that. Rest assured, we're going after whatever market is available to us from our customers. But as far as talking about how many tons we're taking from 1 customer or another, or from 1 producer to another, number 1, we don't really know that; number 2, it's inappropriate.","Operator","The next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a question here. I was wondering if you can comment a little bit. You had mentioned in your press release about, I guess, a green shoot in the construction recovery of sorts. I was kind of wondering if you can give us some color on segments, res versus non-res and geography and sort of how you expect this to shape out as the year unfolds.","Daniel R. DiMicco","I really don't have a good answer for you on that. John, do you have anything?","John J. Ferriola","I guess the only thing I would point out is what we said was we see some signs, some small signs of improvement. Okay? So we're not seeing a boom in construction by any stretch of the imagination. We're seeing small indications that it might be getting better across the board, nonresidential construction, some of the infrastructure work that we are involved with, we a small pickup in that. So we see a small incremental improvement and that's just, we're pointing out it's a good sign, it's a good start, good first step. The ABI, for 2 months in a row, was over 50%. That's the first time that's happened in several years. So these are all small indicators that things might be just getting just a little bit better as we move forward into 2012.","Daniel R. DiMicco","The other thing, there's a huge pent-up demand for a lot of infrastructure work, energy work, that needs to be done that's going to take public, private partnerships to make these things happen. I was encouraged by what I heard in the State of the Union; of course, words are just that. Strong actions are necessary and we look forward to those strong actions actually helping the nonresidential energy construction markets in 2012. But it's too early to tell where that'll come from and how strong it'll be. But there's no doubt that we're past the time when we have to make these kind of investments and find the money to do it.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And sort of based on that, given the fact that it looks like imports are starting to creep up a little bit and RG, I guess, restarted and so forth. Do you think that there's going to be enough demand in the system to overcome that or is it really going to come down to the President delivering on some of the promises during the State of the Union?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, the RG doesn't really impact the nonresidential construction that we're talking about and the issues that we're talking about with respect to what the President had to say in that regard, and in the energy sector. And imports are always an issue, always a concern, something that we constantly monitor on a daily basis. Not just a monthly basis. And we have strategies in place to deal with imports, whether they be proactively in Washington, constantly monitoring the flows, the pricing. And we hear about it all, nothing gets hidden from us and we will take appropriate action, as necessary, both in the marketplace and through our legal channels in Washington in a proactive manner. But imports are always an issue. And for the year 2011, imports were up fairly strongly, particularly considering the overall capacity utilization rate in our domestic industry. I think they were over 20% of the market, way too strong considering where the domestic industry is. And they've ebbed a little bit over the last few months, but we know that the tide comes and goes and so we would not be surprised to see it strengthen as we go through the year, and also weaken depending upon what ramifications there are and what remedies we take to deal with them in the marketplace or elsewhere.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. One final question if I may. Your SG&A was better than what we were looking for this quarter. Is this a sustainable level that we should be thinking on a go-forward basis?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Our SG&A changes based upon profitability. Jim, you got anything you want to add to that?","James D. Frias","Yes, that was the biggest single factor.  There wasn't anything too unusual to call out in SG&A in the quarter for us.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Our bonuses and profit-sharing and what have you, all add to that as we become more profitable going forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your strategic focus. Certainly, in 2012, you talk about your balance sheet, that you have quite a bit of restricted cash, a big CapEx budget. Are you more -- is it fair to say you're more focused on internal growth than acquisitive growth? Is there a lot more room for you to do things beyond what you've told us? If you could just detail that a little more.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, I would have to definitely characterize our current growth mode as being internal, optimizing, broadening our product reach, broadening our quality reach, moving into raw materials more strongly, energy. All those things are true. We are constantly in tune with the M&A opportunities that may or may not exist from time to time. Those are things we always evaluate, so I wouldn't say we're any less interested in M&A activity. I just would say that there's not a lot of that taking place at present. And even where people tried to get some things going, they didn't pan out too well. And so our major focus in our capital expenditures are going to be as we've already discussed. It will be substantial. They will increase as we continue to go forward through 2013 into '14. We have a lot of projects that we're evaluating and a lot of projects in the works. And we will discuss them as they get to the point of becoming reality. And most of those continue to be based upon strengthening our existing footprint, maybe some international growth in certain areas of the world, particularly in the Western Hemisphere, Central and South America, as well as in North America.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And if I could, one more question, just on the construction markets since you're so involved in there. Your Downstream businesses especially might be ahead of the cycle. Structural shipments were up pretty sharply, more than we would have seasonally expected. Can you give us a little bit more color about what might be happening downstream and in structurals? And is there a possibility, I know you're expecting small growth for construction, but is there a possibility that you think that, that could surprise us better than we expected?","John J. Ferriola","We did see our structural shipments go up. We do expect that to continue going into the first half of the year. It's, again, as we mentioned earlier, maybe a little bit of construction improvement, infrastructure improvement. We don't see a big jump in that.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, anything downstream worth pointing out?","Daniel R. DiMicco","The biggest positives on the downstream are the year-over-year improvements that we've seen in virtually all of our downstream businesses in terms of profitability. And where there were some strong negatives, those strong negatives have shrunk dramatically. And we believe we'll continue to see that level stay where it is today, with some slight improvements. But again, we've been very cautious in saying we expect small improvements. If some other things fall into place that could be significant improvements. There are more manufacturing coming back to the country. It's not a flood by any means, but it's happening. We're building things here. Other companies are building here because of the special natural gas game-changing events that are taking place. Chemical companies are building plants that they weren't building for the last 20 years and they're expanding others. So there are some good things taking place in the construction arena. And certainly, we will be providing a lot of steel to our own growth plans in Louisiana and elsewhere. But there's no robust change in construction; we're still bouncing along the bottom with a slight upward tilt to it. Hopefully, we'll see that improve during the course of the year. We believe it will, but it's yet to be determined.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Richard Garchitorena with Credit Suisse.","Richard Garchitorena - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So my first question. It looks like, in Q4, we saw a drop in conversion cost versus the third quarter. Can you talk a little bit about some of the components which helped to drive that and how should we look at that going into Q1 into the rest of 2012?","John J. Ferriola","Well, we did have an improvement in our conversion cost, and that's an effort of us focusing, as we always do, on lowering our costs. That's how we are focused on being the low-cost producer. We continue to focus in that area. We continue to make improvements in that area. I would also add to that, that some of the incremental organic projects that we've done over the few years, over the last couple of years, have helped us become more efficient in our operations, and that's had a positive impact on our conversion costs also.","Richard Garchitorena - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","John, could mix also be a factor since we did more bars and beams and sheet, and plate were down a little bit. Could that be a factor?","John J. Ferriola","That could be a factor.","Richard Garchitorena - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And my second question, you mentioned on the call earlier that Steel Mill capacity was about 74%. Can you give us a breakdown of how that is split between the long and sheet mills? And then also, given the strength of the market, if that'll change at all going into 2012?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, we don't get into breaking out each individual product line's capacity utilization rates for competitive reasons. Overall, that's where we're at. And during the course, just looking at the last 12 months, there have been certain product groups, all of them have moved up and down. Sometimes in sync, sometimes out of sync. And we've seen, as we've mentioned, and you can take this as an intuitive comparison, we've told you that we've seen stronger markets in many of our products and those will be operating at the higher rates than otherwise. But as far as next year goes, as far as 2012 goes, we expect to see improvement in our utilization rates, but it's way too early to tell where actually it'll move to. I think, over the last year, we've changed it by, what, John? 3% or 4%?","John J. Ferriola","Year-over-year? It's about 5%.","Daniel R. DiMicco","About 5%. We may see something similar to that over the next 12 months, we may not. GDP is only -- is getting revised downward, both here and around the world. Pretty much folks are looking at a 2% growth rate in GDP here, and that doesn't bode well for big changes. But we didn't have much better growth rate last year and we still were able to improve our utilization rates in certain markets improved by 5%, on average. So we expect to see something similar next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I got a question for you on natural gas. On average, just roughly speaking, how many millions of BTUs do you use a year?","John J. Ferriola","In our existing operations? Is that the question?","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes.","John J. Ferriola","About 30 billion to 35 billion in our existing operations.","James D. Frias","In the steel mills.","John J. Ferriola","In our steel mills.","Daniel R. DiMicco","DRI facility, we project, will be using another 26 billion.","John J. Ferriola","25 billion, 26 billion.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right, and how much of that is hedged?","James D. Frias","Well right now, in terms of financial hedges, we worked through the last of our hedges recently. And so all we have is the new working interest drilling program that's ramping up and it will, as it cycles up, cover our usage for DRI 100%.","John J. Ferriola","And we do have the long-term contract in our Trinidad facility, a 20-year contract with an average cost of about -- it was about $2 an MMBtu.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was just trying to get to how much of a benefit you'll get on your cost structure this year with lower natural gas.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, certainly we will see a benefit with the way that spot prices have going and market prices have gone. I don't think we sat down and figured out what that's going to be at. But it probably will be significant. That's totally unrelated to the drilling program that we have with our partners.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just a last question on the DRI side, where are you planning to get the DRI for the new facility -- I'm sorry, the iron ore for the DRI in the new facility?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Same places we mentioned in some previous calls, Michael. The same people who are supplying us the pellets for our existing operations in Trinidad will pretty much be supplying us for our new operation in New Orleans or Louisiana. John?","John J. Ferriola","I just wanted to make one more point as you were asking about the impact of the lower natural gas. We talked about the direct used gas as being about 35 billion. Don't forget, we are large consumer of electricity, and some of that electricity is produced in coal -- excuse me, gas-fired generation. So we expect to see a positive impact from that also.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So is some of your electric tied to the price of natural gas?","James D. Frias","Yes, definitely.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Some regions of the country more than others, and we're not in a position to give you a breakdown on that. But I think on average, in this country, natural gas is about 20% of power generation across the country. That is going to be growing as we speak and coal percentages will be coming down, but that's about where it is today. So you could probably figure, on average, 20% of our electricity is coming from natural gas-fired facilities, and the fuel charges and what have you will give us, will benefit us to that level. I think there was an article, Michael, the other day that came out and said that the benefit of natural gas in general right now, with pricing moves that have taken place to the low side, are actually reducing power rates by 50%. Quite significant. And so that trend is probably going to continue at least for the interim. But keep in mind that the market is going to make adjustments. Natural gas is in a situation today where technology has created a readily easy abundance. That will drive the market to use more of it. And when we look at something like 1 or 2 or 3 DRI plants, we're looking at 20, 30-plus years where we want to maintain a stable supply. That's why we have entered into these drilling programs in partnership. And there's no doubt about it that you have oil where you've got it at today and projected to be at in the future, that the market's going to take advantage of low-priced natural gas and the price of natural gas is going to go up.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When you get to your target for DRI or scrap-based equivalents, 6 million or 7 million tons, I think you said, will you have to purchase any pig iron outside?","Daniel R. DiMicco","We won't have to. It'll be a matter of opportunity.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Would you possibly locate DRI facilities up in the Midwest, like closer to Crawfordsville?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Right now, I'd say our plans, our immediate and medium-term plans are to do this in Louisiana. The site there is significant, it enables the movement in of raw materials and the movement out of product along the river system quite easily for us. Most of the plants consuming it are going to be on the River. Crawfordsville benefits remain in that heartland scrap breadbasket, where there's a lot of prime scrap. And I don't think they use much pig iron at all. At any time, over the years, we've been using pig iron because of the availability in pricing on the low residual scrap in that market. But the other places on the river system where we have facilities, it's a tremendous benefit for us.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Aldo Mazzaferro from Macquarie.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","I just had a question on the DRI facility up in Louisiana. I was tracking trying to get the gas consumption. It seems that you just gave that. When you use the pellets, do they -- what do they come in at, about 62%? Or is it a higher iron content when the pellets come in? Is it higher?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Close to 68%-plus.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","And so what kind of ratio, then, would you be using, like about 1.3% of pellets to output? Pellets coming into DRI coming out would be, what, about...","Daniel R. DiMicco","4 to 1. Excuse me.  1.4","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","1.4 to 1, right. Yes. And how many people do think you're going to employ down there?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Per unit, 250, is that right? 150.","John J. Ferriola","Yes. Obviously, there'll be many more during the construction phase.","Daniel R. DiMicco","When the place up and running, how many do we have in Trinidad today?","John J. Ferriola","We have about 100 in Trinidad.","Daniel R. DiMicco","This will be a bigger facility, and so 150 per unit that we build.","John J. Ferriola","The first one will be cryo flood [ph] facility, so as we build the second one, it'll require less people to operate the second one than the one in Trinidad.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","I get you. And then so you have people, you have gas expense, you have depreciation. And any other big input costs down there?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Think you've covered it.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","Okay. And the only other question I had, Dan, was on the wide and light project at Berkeley. I think I heard you say you're going to add an additional rolling stand. What's the capital cost in that project? And do you have to widen the cast during the rolling of those also or are they already wide enough to handle that width?","Daniel R. DiMicco","John?","John J. Ferriola","Yes. Well, we've had to do some modification on our existing stands, okay? Obviously, we've added a stand to get the lighter gauge and higher strength material. And in terms of capital, it'd be about -- it's north of $100 million.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","That's great. And then the final thing I had, rate of return on the SBQ investment. You probably can't tell us exactly, but can you tell me if SBQ, today, earns you more or less than $100 a ton?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Yes.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","No, I mean at roughly $100 a ton. I think it definitely meets your standards.","Daniel R. DiMicco","It truly is an estimate I've put it on the product.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Parr with KeyBanc.","Mark L. Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Couple things. You've mentioned energy a couple of times, Dan, and was wondering if the OCTG market, tubular operations, is that something that's important enough to you that it would make it difficult to actually own your own OCTG facility?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, OCTG covers a wide breadth of products. We supply a lot of product to the pipe and tube industry, including oil country grouping. And some products, we would be able to get into without creating any issues. Some products would be a little bit more difficult. Every time I ask my teams about it, they're cautious, but they also believe that done the right way, we could get into it if we decided we wanted to. So that opportunity is there for us, but it's not one of our, as you can tell, one of our pressing investment strategies at this point in time.","Mark L. Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. I appreciate that. Do you have a view on imports for 2012 versus '11? I mean, do you think imports will be...","Daniel R. DiMicco","A view? I'll give you my view. They should be down 20%, maybe 30%. Now, that's my view, my opinion. Exactly what's going to happen, there'll be continual import activity the way there has been. Imports aren't going to go away. They just need to be traded properly, fairly and not illegally. And we'll deal with it.","John J. Ferriola","Dan, you mentioned earlier, we'll deal with it commercially and legally as we have to. I would point out a couple of things relative to imports. With the extended lead times that are required with the imports that presents a bit of a challenge. Potential for quality issues presents a bit of a challenge. And the other thing is the tight inventory levels that we have currently in the service center industry, makes it a little bit more challenging for them to go out on a limb and make those large buys that are going to be delivered 3 or 4 months from today when we're not sure what the market will be.","Mark L. Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Well, you've seen the imports as a percent of the overall market come in, in the last 3 years. So clearly, as the markets become tighter, and also, you've got capacity to give for the domestic market, import's got to be an awfully compelling opportunity to take that risk. I agree with you. But it's good. Another thing, I don't think you mentioned export opportunities or anything new along those lines, Dan or John, that in terms of kind of where you were for the full year as far as export mix and whether or not that's going to change in 2012?","John J. Ferriola","We continue to grow our international footprint, our commercial footprint. We are, right now, at about maybe 1% or 2% higher than we were in 2010, but not a large increase. We have established our first steel depot in Colombia and we expect great things out of that facility. That's going to put some product on the ground in a country where our commercial activities have been growing and the economy is strong. So we see good things there. We continue to focus on Central and South America, and we anticipate continuing to grow that, our exports. We said last year that we'd like to see a goal of 15% of our total products being exported, and we haven't changed that goal.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michelle Applebaum with Steel Market Intelligence.","Michelle Applebaum","A couple things. On the 72-inch, on that expansion, how much more of the market can you reach now with that product?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Remember that the expansion that we're doing at Berkeley involves not just width, but also going lighter, and it also involves shipping product to some of our other mills, like the Decatur mill, where we'll be able to galvanize 72-inch wide. And so with all that you have to take into account when you're talking about how much more of the market does this open up for you, it's both a width and thickness benefit. John, you got any...","John J. Ferriola","I guess it's hard to pinpoint an exact number as what percentage it opens up to us. Dan mentioned the galvanized product with the utilization of our other facilities. I do want to also point out it's more than we keep talking about the width, right But when you go that narrow, when you go that light, and with the extra strand getting the extra strength that it puts into the steel, also opens up other opportunities for us. So it's not just in the automotive as a result of the width, but it's also the physical characteristics of the steel itself that will open opportunities for us.","James D. Frias","We're not talking about 50 or 60 tons. We're talking of hundreds of thousands of tons of additional market opening up to us.","Michelle Applebaum","Right and high-value, a high profit and...","Daniel R. DiMicco","Absolutely.","Michelle Applebaum","I'm trying to figure out, there's a fee change here in terms of mix where Nucor's sweet spot has always been to go to the center of the market. So you've left on the, you want to call, the more specialty grades. And in the last couple of years -- it's really been over the decade, but accelerated the last few years, whether it's SBQ, whether it's this product. I'm trying to get a handle on how much further downstream you've gone. There's no way to generalize, is there?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well listen, Nucor has been doing this since we bought the first to Steel Mill. We did it when I was out in Plymouth, Utah. We did it when I was at Nucor-Yamato, and we're doing it today. And the biggest area that we've been doing it in is the newest product group that we've gotten it to over our history, and that's flat-rolled and plate. And we've moved into the high end of the SBQ business as well. And it's been a continual thing. It's been part of our strategy, and the key to it, for us, is that you do that without vacating any of the other spaces that you've occupied. That was a mistake a lot of steel companies made 20, 30 years ago, where they basically let the mini mills in at the low end and held onto the high end. Our strategy is one based upon learning from that painful lesson. And so we are growing our footprint, not shifting it. That's an important distinction and we're going to continue to grow it. And it won't be long before there's not a grade of steel in any of those product lines that we're not capable of making on a consistent basis.","Michelle Applebaum","Exactly. Forgive me for being greedy because you're announcing all these different growth kinds of things in the last couple days. But can we get an update on the new maybe potential plate mill?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Plate mill is something that we're continuing to investigate. We've taken a look at sites and it's an opportunity that, as the market continued to develop, we will switch our emphasis from one of exploring to one of actually implementing but we're not at that implementation stage yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Dubinsky with Wells Fargo.","Sam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. Given that construction markets are showing some signs of life, do you expect the Steel Products division to breakeven or even be positive in 2012? Then I have a follow-up.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, the magnitude of the improvement from 2010 to 2011 was significant. We don't expect to see the same significant level of improvement, but we do expect to see continued improvement, particularly in the middle to the latter part of 2012.","Sam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then in terms of pricing through 2Q, I know there's not a lot of visibility in the market, but it seems like some of the price hikes, at least for Long Products, had been due to rising scrap costs. With scrap potentially trading lower, do you think pricing can stay at today's levels?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, always keep in mind that while raw materials maybe the initiator of pricing moves, it's the market that determines whether or not you can hold onto those pricing moves that you worked to get because your raw materials are going up. And it's something that if the market is strong enough, it'll allow us to recoup those costs. In the recent time period it has. And we hope that, that trend continues going through next year. There's obviously a whole host of issues that can impact that, and we\u2019ve talked about some of them today, and you guys have brought some of them up. But you always have to keep in mind, just because scrap costs go up or ore costs go up or coal costs go up, doesn't mean that you automatically get it back in price increases. The market has to be conducive to it. The demand in the marketplace has to be strong enough to accept it. And so that is not a direct result every time. And you've seen us have to move up and down based on what the market says we can get for pricing.","Sam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just my last one, just for modeling purposes, how should we think about minority interest and equity income going forward?","Daniel R. DiMicco","How should you think about it in terms of absolute terms or general terms?","Sam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, on a dollar basis just because it's been a little volatile.","James D. Frias","Yes, we won't say an absolute about, but keep in mind, we took a $7 million charge in the third quarter that maybe expensed higher, and then we got a $7 million benefit in the fourth quarter. So I would back those out and then make your judgments from there.","Operator","Our last question comes from Dave Martin with Deutsche Bank.","David S. Martin - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I had a couple follow-ups. Hopefully, it'll be quick. Starting with the DRI project. You mentioned the drilling program. What's the CapEx and the budget related to the drilling program? And also, I'm curious if there's any triggers in the agreement in which if natural gas falls below some price, the drilling stops?","James D. Frias","Well, we do have triggers in the program, so that as natural gas falls below a certain level, we can, and most likely will, stop drilling. As far as the CapEx goes, we're not going to go down that path. Not in total, but in 2012, we think it's going to be the in the neighborhood of $100 million out of that $1 billion that we called out for our total spending this year.","David S. Martin - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just keeping in the energy theme, Dan, you mentioned earlier that for SBQ, energy represented, I believe, as much as 15% of sales. I'd just be curious if you could ballpark what your energy exposure was for your other main products?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, as we mentioned earlier, on the SBQ, it could be as much as even 20% on the SBQ. Rick [ph] and the guys are now comparing notes on the other product lines -- the horses are coming in lined up. I think we're ready to give an answer.","James D. Frias","We don't have much on structural. But the plate, probably around 10% also. And on sheet, the same ballpark, about 10%, maybe 10% to 15%.","Daniel R. DiMicco","But those are all growing opportunities. Those numbers will move forward as the energy activity continues to develop in this country, which it is going to for decades to come.","David S. Martin - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, I had a follow-up for Jim. On the correction of the accrual of $29 million, was that in SG&A and, therefore, the explanation why SG&A fell so much quarter-over-quarter?","James D. Frias","No, it was not. It was in cost of goods sold. One other thing about the quarter-over-quarter move that somebody brought up in the background we were talking is, in the third quarter, we did take a charge of about $14 million that we disclosed in the 10-Q regarding a dust recycling facility. So third quarter did have a $14 million higher charge than what we had in the fourth quarter.","Daniel R. DiMicco","If there are no more questions, I'd just like to say thank you for your participation and your interest in Nucor. And once again, thank our shareholders and our teammates and our customers and suppliers for helping make Nucor a success, a continuing success. Our best years are truly yet to come. Thank you, all.","Operator","That concludes today's conference.

Please go ahead, sir.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. We appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior new management team, Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; Chief Digital Officer, Joe Stratman; and our other Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Leon Topalian, Dave Sumoski and Chad Utermark.","The leadership team in Charlotte would like to thank all of our teammates throughout Nucor for their excellent work in the first nine months of 2017 to build a safer, stronger and more profitable Nucor. You are the reason our company's best years are still ahead of us. Thank you.","We also want to extend a very warm welcome to the newest members of the Nucor family, the approximately 125 teammates who joined us in September with our acquisition of cold finished bar facilities in St. Louis Missouri and Monterrey Mexico. Nucor is proud and excited to have you on Board.","Our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias will now review Nucor's third quarter performance and financial position. Following those comments, I will update you on the execution of our strategy for long-term profitable growth. Jim?","Jim Frias","Thanks John.","Nucor reported third quarter of 2017 earnings of $0.83 per diluted share. Nucor's third quarter performance represents a decrease compared to second quarter of 2017 earnings of $1 per diluted share and year ago third quarter earnings of $0.95 per diluted share.","Our earnings for the first nine months of 2017 of $2.94 per diluted share compared to $1.99 per share for the first nine months of 2016. The first nine months of 2017 earnings actually exceed annual earnings achieved every year since 2008, a cyclical peak year. Nucor's disciplined strategy for profitable growth is working. During the steel industry's protracted downturn, we have invested aggressively to increase our capabilities for delivering value to our customers and profitable growth for our shareholders.","We're achieving these improved results when large parts of our business including rebar, merchant bar, special bar quality steel, plate steel, structural steel, and DRI are operating well below peak performance. Our team is encouraged but not satisfied by the initial returns we have realized this year.","Compared to second quarter 2017, our third quarter earnings decline were largely reflected lower capacity utilization rates and metal margins at our steel mills segment, as well as the impact of an unplanned outage at our Louisiana direct reduced iron ore DRI plant.","The facility stopped production in late July, and resumed operations in early October. Third quarter earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests in the raw material segment declined approximately $56 million compared to the second quarter. The vast majority of this decline was driven by the unplanned outage at Nucor Steel Louisiana, the last of the majority of the third quarter.","The profitability of our steel products segment improved in the third quarter from the second quarter. Our comment about our tax rate as it can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was 29.3% for the third quarter and 32.1% for year-to-date 2017.","Third quarter of 2017 results included a benefit totaling $0.04 per diluted share related to tax return true-ups and state tax credits. This benefit was incorporated in our guidance issued in mid-September.","Nucor's financial position remains strong. With total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion our gross debt to capital ratio was 33% at the end of the third quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled over $1.6 billion. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until April 2021.","For 2017 we estimate capital spending of approximately $500 million and depreciation and amortization of about $730 million. During the third quarter of 2017, Nucor repurchased 1,591,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of about $90 million or just under $57 per share. Nucor's capital allocation priorities are clear and they have been consistently practiced over many years.","Our first priority is to invest for profitable long-term growth. Nucor's growth investment strategy is simple and flexible. We are leveraging our five drivers to profitable growth. Our second priority is to pay cash dividends consistent with our success in delivering long-term earnings growth. Nucor has increased its space dividend for 44 consecutive years. We believe that record is strong evidence of both the sustainability of our business and our disciplined approach to capital allocation.","Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase our stock when our cash position is strong and our shares are attractively priced. From 2004 to the just completed quarter, Nucor has cumulatively returned $8.3 billion to our shareholders via regular dividends, supplemental dividends and share repurchases. These returns to shareholders represent approximately 39% of Nucor's cash from operations generated over that period.","We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages, highly adaptable business model, and proven strategies will allow our team to continue to deliver profitable long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor's shareholders.","Approaching the end of 2017, we are encouraged by number of positive factors impacting our markets going into 2018. We see generally stable or improving conditions for our most important end markets including nonresidential construction, automotive, energy, heavy equipment and agriculture.","Although illegally traded imports remain at unacceptable levels, we are encouraged by the cumulative benefits of the U.S. steel industry's successful trade cases. We expect fourth quarter earnings to be similar to slightly decreased from the third quarter exclusive of the previously mentioned tax benefit recognized in the third quarter.","The raw materials segment's performance should improve significantly driven by more consistent DRI production. The steel products segment is likely to benefit from margin improvement. The steel mills segment will see some decline largely due to weakness in plate and typical seasonality.","Thank you for your interest in our company. John?","John Ferriola","Thanks Jim.","Nucor's disciplined strategy for profitable growth is working. Jim noted that our first nine months of 2017 earnings represent Nucor's best performance for this period since the cyclical peak year of 2008. In fact, our year-to-date earnings of $948 million are more than double Nucor's average comparable period earnings of $411 million reported during the 2010 to 2016 time period.","More than 25,000 men and women of Nucor team are delivering this profitable growth despite several ongoing headwinds. 2017 has seen a renewed search of illegally traded imports into the U.S. Through the first nine months of 2017, finished steel imports have increased an estimated 15% compared to the same period last year. The year-to-date market share for finished steel imports stands at approximately 27%.","Nucor continues to believe significant work remains to be done to achieve free and fair trade for U.S. manufacturers. More specifically it is time for comprehensive and broad based remedies that address illegal foreign trade practices that have materially weakened our nation's economic volatility.","We applaud the U.S. international trade commissions, unanimous and affirmative vote earlier this month on Whirlpool's Section 201 petition regarding serious injury from imported washing machines. Nucor and our customers embrace and thrive in a marketplace where winners are determined by real economic advantages earned by efficiency and innovation.","Additionally, growth remains modest in our key end-use market nonresidential construction. Estimated 2017 nonresidential construction activity measured by square footage represents only 67% of the most recent cyclical peak level reached in 2007. Rebuilding America's infrastructure is an absolute prerequisite to the U.S. economy returning to a vibrant growth path that delivers rising standards of living for everyone.","Nucor continues to urge bipartisan action on this critical issue. Action is years overdue on a meaningful infrastructure investment plan for our country. Economic and industry conditions remain challenging but the men and women on the Nucor team are doers. Our focus remains on what is under our control, execution of our disciplined strategy for long-term profitable growth.","The strategy is simple and flexible. We are leveraging Nucor's five drivers to profitable growth. The five drivers are strengthen our position as a low-cost producer, achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher quality, higher margin products, expand and leverage our downstream channels to market to increase our steel mill's base load volume for sustained results and achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength.","I will now update you on highlights of our team's recent progress implementing our strategy for profitable growth. During the third quarter, we announced two growth investments for our bar mill group. A micro mill project is being considered for five states in the Midwest and Southeast, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, South Carolina and Florida. We will also be expanding our existing merchant bar operations in either Illinois or Ohio.","Nucor's bar mill's are a cornerstone of our company. Capitalizing on opposition is a market leader in a low-cost producer of merchant and rebar. They consistently generate attractive returns on capital and free cash flow.","Both the micro mill project and the expansion of our merchant bar operations leverage our existing infrastructure and allow us to better serve our customers. These investments will combine the firepower of multiple drivers to profitable growth enhancing our position as a market leader and low-cost producer, expanding our capabilities to serve our downstream channels to market, and pursuing across the board commercial excellence.","In September we completed our acquisition of two cold finished bar products facilities, one in Missouri and one in Mexico for a purchase price of approximately $60 million. The combined capacity of the plants is 200,000 tons which increases Nucor's total cold finished bar and wire facilities to more than 1.1 million tons annually.","This acquisition advances our profitable growth strategy on a number of fronts. It expands Nucor's market leadership position in cold finished products. It grows our portfolio of value-added products. It creates synergies with our bar mills by providing an additional channel to market for Nucor's special bar quality or SBQ products.","On a geographical perspective, we are increasing our footprint in the U.S. and gaining entry into the Mexican market. This positions Nucor cold finish to better serve North American automotive and industrial customers. In his remarks, Jim discussed the Louisiana's DRI plants negative impact on third quarter earnings. When in operation our Louisiana DRI facility has met and in many cases exceeded our expectations for quality and conversion costs.","The challenge is been Louisiana's inability to achieve consistent uptime. Various equipment failures and other issues have resulted in a number of unplanned outages. In light of this unacceptable performance pattern, we are currently focused on developing a more holistic approach to achieving system-wide reliability at the plant.","As we study potential design and engineering modifications at Louisiana, we will be drawing upon lessons learned from our Trinidad DRI plant. Trinidad is currently approaching world-class productivity levels to complement its long-standing world-class quality achievements. Nucor's DRI production capacity is a critical foundation supporting our strategy to move up the value chain and that strategy is working.","I am pleased to report that are Decatur, Alabama sheet mill was notified this month that Nucor will be one of three recipients of the Honda Environmental Recognition Award at Honda's Sustainability Symposium on October 24. Nucor is receiving this recognition for supplying galvanneal, cold-rolled, high-strength steel as a replacement for this grade produced by integrated steel mills.","Nucor's EAF production process emits roughly 70% less carbon dioxide and equivalent greenhouse gases to manufacture the equivalent amount of steel produced by integrated steel mills, yet has improved performance ability. Congratulations and thank you to our Decatur sheet mill teammates to get excellent work. Please keep it going.","For a company such as Nucor with its unique position of strength and proven ability to execute its strategy for profitable growth, this is a time of great opportunity. That is why the Nucor team is both ready and eager to continue unleashing the pent-up earnings power that we have built into our company during the industry downturn. I am absolutely confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us.","We appreciate your interest in Nucor, and would now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jorge Beristain of Deutsche Bank.","Jorge Beristain","I just wanted to do a check on your situation with electrodes in the face of the reason 10 times spike, how much inventory do you have and when do you see the price effect kind of kicking in 2018?","Jim Frias","Let me start by saying that we do not buy our electrodes on spot markets. We have long established contractual relationship with our suppliers and as a result we feel pretty good about our position.","First, the most important thing we think a look at it as our availability, we make sure that we do have electrodes and we have right now we think our inventory will get us through the first quarter of next year, so we're feeling very confident about that and we have letters of intent from our suppliers to be able to supply us with electrodes for the rest of 2018.","So for us supply is really not an issue and because of the contractual arrangements - all the hype that you\u2019re reading about the spot price increases really doesn\u2019t pertain to us and we have pricing through the first half of next year. And we expect to see increases in the second half of next year in pricing but again availability is really not an issue for us.","We buy, we buy almost all of our electrodes domestically and well rather, let me rephrase that we buy none of them from China. And so we don\u2019t see any issue with the Chinese issue of supply.","The other thing that I would point out that gives me quite a little bit of advantage on this is our DRI usage. Through our DRI we\u2019re able to accomplish what we call single charging and that reduces our power on times that our EAF - and reduces this is the energy consumption that we have as well as the electrode consumption by about 10% which is pretty significant.","And a result of us not requiring us to swing the roof off as a result of using the DRI and the feeding of the DRI through the roof of a furnace. So all those reasons we feel pretty good about where we are both on availability and where we are on pricing and frankly our position on terms of consumption of electrodes as a result of our DRI usage.","Jorge Beristain","If I could squeak in a second question, can you just comment there has been some competitors recently announcing price hikes do you believe the market is right for a hike right now in HRC?","John Ferriola","We announced one last night and as I have said many times on this call we don't make twice in these announcements unless we believe that they\u2019re appropriate and that the market is ready to accept them. So that's my answer to that question. We think it is appropriate and we think that it will stick.","Operator","And our next question will come from Seth Rosenfeld of Jefferies.","Seth Rosenfeld","I have couple of questions on the plate market outlook please. In fact earlier on the call I think in the release as well and that play with a meaningful drag on Q3 to begin in Q4 earnings. But looking to the shipment and pricing data looks like your shipment perhaps grew over 20% year-over-year in Q3, I realized price is roughly stable quarter-over-quarter.","So can you just help us understand a bit better what's driving the current margin drag and then with that in mind perhaps what we should expect into Q4. Obviously the spot market has indeed weakened so are you basically expecting a bit of catch up on margins in the fourth quarter? Thank you.","John Ferriola","I\u2019m going to let Leon who is responsible for our plate operations begin and then I\u2019ll add anything maybe towards the end. Leon?","Leon Topalian","We have seen some metrics that are better than a year ago certainly, shipments are up year-over-year as you indicated. Our backlogs are little stronger and we do see some segments and reaches this mining military applications that are improving and continue to have strong demand. As we look to the fourth quarter we would anticipate probably the market stable going through the fourth quarter.","However, as we saw in the first half of 2017, service centers really began to restock inventory levels. In the last quarter and moving forward we see that pretty stable and then putting a lot of pressure on pricing so that\u2019s some - obviously the demand is having is at its best and so that it will put some contraction now pricing moving forward.","John Ferriola","I might add just two quick points to that Leon, when I look at Q&T products, our Q&T lines are now full that\u2019s an improvement of what we seen in the past but that\u2019s good news. The trade cases are doubling but the amount dumped Q&T imports and frankly the return of the mining and energy business has contributed to demand side.","My final comment would be on infrastructure and we feel very strongly that this country is in dire need of a very intensive infrastructure program. We have confidence that at some point in the near future we will see some action and we\u2019re encouraging bipartisan action on this issue. I think there is one thing the hurricane and the damage caused by hurricanes have thought us is that we need to really upgrade our infrastructure throughout the United States.","When that happens, we expect to see an improvement in the plate demand as a result of that infrastructure we built. So going into 2018 we see some positive things on the horizon.","Seth Rosenfeld","Just one follow-up question and I guess a lot of what you walk through outside of the move on inventory the service and centers actually paint some more positive picture for plate on the demand side and particular. Can you give a sense and what's happening in terms of your margins whether or not will be a bit more dramatic like expecting a bit pullback into the fourth quarter.","And then a separate question as well if I may, on the Louisiana DRI facility can you please walk us through a bit more detail what really has been the cause you believe of the recent maintenance issues, what other components you have and a more stable Q4. And as you mentioned earlier, you\u2019re just in the process of taking more holistically towards the facility, when should we expect more complete update on what's happening looking forward?","John Ferriola","Well I\u2019ll ask Jim to address the first issue on margins.","Jim Darsey","I think when Leon was talking about service and restocking he was talking about the beginning part of the year not what we\u2019re seeing currently. And so now that time is passed and so we're getting a bit of a boost in the first part of the year in the plate market because of that.","Then as the year progress, scrap price has moved up and we were unable to move plate prices up with scrap prices. So we started to see a margin compression and that\u2019s where we live now. We\u2019re living in a margin-compressed world today and we think that will continue on to the fourth quarter. However, when we look at end market demand it hasn't changed from end it's probably improved just had that restocking that benefited us at the beginning of the year is over.","Jim Frias","Since we pack on plate, I might just make an additional comment that when I look at the work we\u2019re doing on grades at our Tuscaloosa facility, as well as our Hertford facility we are now qualified and in some cases in the process of being qualified to be able to supply most of the plates that goes into the large pipe and transmission lines and that's very exciting.","One more point on this because I hear this all the time about the U.S. industry as a whole and that is that we\u2019re not able to produce all of the products necessary to appease the tight market in the United States. While Nucor cannot supply all the grades, they\u2019re all available within the U.S. market and there is no reason therefore to have any exceptions on the trade cases relative to pipe.","So now while we move on to your final question was on Louisiana, okay and I\u2019ll make some comments on that and Jim you can jump in if there is anything you\u2019d like to add to it. One of the things as we said in the script while we\u2019re looking to accomplish with the modifications that we have to our long-term process that we have been using what we call HYL the new process, we were looking to accomplish improvements in our quality and at the same time decrease the amount of issues of missions and therefore improve the environmental friendliness of the process.","And in those two metrics, we\u2019ve been very successful. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the quality of the product that's come out of Louisiana and we\u2019ve been very pleased with the reduction and emissions by using this technology.","The challenge of course is mainly liability and we recognize that and we are now in the process of taking time to look at the entire - the engineering of the entire process, making the necessary adjustments as we referred to and taking a holistic approach to the entire process from beginning to end and making the changes that we believe are necessary to improve reliability.","And as we go forward in that study we of course will be tapping in for the talent and the lessons that we learnt in our Trinidad facility which is frankly world known for its reliability, as well as quality but particularly its reliability. So that process we expect to take the next couple of months at the end of that period we\u2019ll be able to give you a better explanation of the time that would be involved to make any repairs that we feel are required.","Jim Darsey","Yes Jim, let me add one other thing and that is that the plant did start its operations up early October. It\u2019s running near full capacity again. We\u2019re doing these things proactively not because we have a problem today its running well and we don't see any reason why it shouldn\u2019t continue to run well.","However, when you had the track record we've had, you\u2019d be forced to put your head in the sand it\u2019s not possible to be in other problems we\u2019re trying to be proactive looking at every possible issue that the other things we could do that make the plan even more reliable.","Jim Frias","That\u2019s a good point Jim because I should have pointed out we might go through this process in segue and reengineering it taking a hard look at from a holistic engineering perspective and come to the conclusion that the improvements that we have made to the process to-date both in the process gas heater and in the furnace itself have rectified the issues.","I mentioned several times on this call and I\u2019ll repeat it, the technology itself doesn\u2019t seem to be the issue, it's the equipment that has enabled the technology to result in less emissions in particular that\u2019s been a major change that has given us the most heartburn with the facilities. So we\u2019ve taken a hard look at that we want to find a solution that allows us to continue the improved environmental aspects of producing DRI while still having the improved reliability.","Operator","And our next question will come from Timna Tanners of Bank of America.","Timna Tanners","So want to ask you a question I asked earlier but I\u2019m just asking with how much the U.S. market is kind of lag the global market and I know the recent price hike maybe addresses that. Is there any structural reason you can think of why the U.S. market will respond to higher global prices or do you think that this has just been something may be related to this time of the year or any other explanation you have would be great?","John Ferriola","Yes, I definitely do not feel that there is any structural change that is resulting in this. I think it\u2019s more or less a question of lagging and leading cycle. We go through this from time to time where the one or the other one will make a major move in this case we see global pricing move up and at the same time - frankly because of the import service that is occurred in the United States that has had a very negative impact on the demand here in the United States and our ability is to meet that demand.","Although demand has improved but the improvement in demand is being up till by being legally traded products. So when we see that again actually coming to an end we see pricing frankly we think its bottomed out we made our price announcements and as you point out $40 move on off bar, we believe the market will support that will reduce the gap.","So really Timna I think it\u2019s more of just a case of the lead, lag on what is normally a cyclical pricing environment that compounded a little bit by the impact of illegally traded imports on us \u2013 we shifting the demand, the supply in the United States that had a negative impact on pricing and now as I said we believe that is bottomed.","There is a little bit seasonality to it. It also I think Timna if you look back over the past several years you\u2019ll see the same kind of thing happening at the end of September or early October things are going to slow down a little but you\u2019ll see an impact on pricing and that occurs more here in the states than on the global marketplace. So that also might have played a role there.","Timna Tanners","And then kind of a big question just in this whole topic of capital allocation how you think about using cash. Clearly you need to buyback done that for a while so I was just hoping you could comment a little bit more about how you think about buyback in your tool kit and then talking about a new micro mill do we really need more rebar if you could explain that a little bit more. And then how you\u2019re looking at other M&A and options in a little more detail would be great?","John Ferriola","Let\u2019s start with the first question. I\u2019ll ask Jim to address the buyback issue.","Jim Darsey","We have done a lot of returning of cash to shareholders over the years and we've used base dividends supplemental dividends and share repurchases. We also look at what we have in our pipeline in terms of free cash flows as we forecast the future and imminent M&A transactions. We always have things in the pipeline we look at what's imminent and about to happen.","And so we were encouraged by both the fact that we felt like the stock price was a little undervalued. We had a lot of liquidity and so we will always opportunistic to look at that and we that our dividends this year as we gone deeper in the year our payout ratio is going to be above 40% as we talked in the past that\u2019s something that we think about in terms of what we make sure we\u2019re paying at least that much in dividends.","And so that was kind of the way we looked at it is. It was a good opportunity to use some of our extra cash with the stock price where it was.","John Ferriola","And now we have second question had to do with rebar in our investment in new rebar mills relative to the marketplace, and I\u2019m going to ask Dave to tackle that one.","Dave Sumoski","Timna, Nucor we are committed to the rebar business and maintaining our low cost position in the market. We believe that micro mill is a viable technology and it will allow us to better utilize our regional approach in growth markets where we have scrap available. We\u2019re confident that we will see some increased investment in infrastructure as well.","John Ferriola","Dave maybe just trying to add two points to that. One is and you kind of touched upon it, we\u2019re looking to place these markets, so we\u2019re turning to micro mills looking to place them in markets where Nucor has a large scrap supply, as well as we know that there is a good demand that\u2019s being under served in that particular region.","So we will look at this being able to give us a good return basically based upon largest and the impact that will have by a low logistics cost and getting scrap to the mill and then from the mill to our customers.","And the other point that I would - we mentioned this in the script that I want to emphasize it again. When you look at rebar and merchant bar in general, long products in general I mean that\u2019s not a real cornerstone for our company. In fact I would like to say that it built our company and when I look at the rebar strategy and the expansion of it, one of the five drivers of profitable growth is to improve and increase our downstream of channel to the market and we\u2019ve got a great channel to the market through Harris.","So we feel that although you might feel that there is excess or if not need for additional rebar in the United States, we\u2019re confident that based on the location that we\u2019re putting them, the geographical locations that that was going to select and our channel to the market through Harris, these are going to be very good investments with good returns to Nucor.","Jim Frias","There is a big logistics play and we always approach these markets regionally and we feel that this technology that's proven will allow us to expand on that on that regional approach and focusing where we have scrap available to us and where there are markets already existing.","John Ferriola","And can I ask you to repeat the third part of the question I know it has something to do with mergers and acquisitions.","Timna Tanners","Yes there is a one question. So I was just asking about capital allocation broadly and then if you had any more comments about how you're thinking about M&A options or priorities?","John Ferriola","I can answer that one without even getting help from Jim. How are we looking at growth opportunities and our capital investments going forward, I will tell you what, we have got a full pipeline of opportunities, there is a lot of things that are taking place in the world today, I will show you and most of them, there is a lot of things happening both in the global marketplace and in the United States, a lot of changes, some companies are more challenge than others and that provides opportunities, we want to continue to invest in our downstream businesses to improve our channel, we were looking at additional upstream opportunities to invest in.","So I mean we are in a great cash position, this is again one of those cases we\u2019re having a strong, a very strong balance sheet, it gives us opportunities to continue to build upon five drivers of profitable growth and we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunities out there.","Now one thing that I would tell you that we will look at every area that we invest and that is value added investments, investments that are going to improve the value added we think that is the higher we move up the value chain, the higher the margin and the more sustainable the business.","So the investments that you see as may going forward will all up be in the area of improving our value proposition by providing higher value products to value appreciative customers willing to pay for that higher value and what we will be focusing on.","Operator","And the next question will come from Curtis Woodworth of Credit Suisse.","Curtis Woodworth","So I\u2019m going to drill down into the rebar market as well, it has been some are perplexing from my perspective this year and that metal spreads seemingly continue to trend lower, you have the Turkish terror, it seems like all the excess inventory in the calls has been absorbed and that is pretty close, I think Turkey is selling at 525, 530 metrics which as I think about what the price is on a landed basis in the U.S. around like 555, 560.","Can you comment on how you see this market sort of evolving into next year and then I know you've been in Washington. It seems like from sitting [indiscernible] John with respect to 232, do you think that from your discussions recently you said this is asset 232 is still going to happen and do you see rebar playing into that? Thank you.","John Ferriola","Let me start and you can add on. Basically your question is if I\u2019m hearing it correctly is look there is a lot of things that\u2019s evenly changing in the marketplace but still the margins on rebar and pricing continues to drip down. But I think you have to consider is what happened at the beginning part of the year is surge of inflows that came into this.","Still a month where we saw a 30% of the market share is slightly higher and 30% of market share going to inflows on rebar. So there is a little bit of a lag in the effects, so we are still seeing some of the negative consequences or the negative impacts, the adverse impact of that surge of imports that was totally out of control beginning of the year and yes with one trade cases, I find that we didn\u2019t get the kind of remedies that we felt we are justifying given the surge and we\u2019re going back in Washington as you noted, we\u2019re going to continue to fight and we\u2019re going to continue to win cases and continuing to appeal on that, we don't get the right outcomes.","So I mean it\u2019s really the story of the rebar in the United States this year is all about we summed up in single word and that is or two words illegally traded imports against that, illegally trade imports and the need to stop them and get the same, get the situation on the control.","And I\u2019m confident again that given the actions that we\u2019re taking in Washington we will see those positive results. Dave, do you want to add anything to this?","Dave Sumoski","Just demand is decent, I mean you really hit it. You illegally traded in ports or the thing that really hit us at the beginning to hear those record levels of imports. We\u2019re working away through that import level is down about 21% now, since we have got the - now we\u2019re starting to see rebar coming from other areas besides Turkey. But it\u2019s down we feel with demand is decent and we look forward.","Jim Frias","I guess on the brighter side we look forward going into the end of the fourth quarter, end of the year and into next year because of the decrease in imports now it\u2019s going to take a while for that surge to work its way through the system no doubt about that.","But we will continue to see and we believe we will continue to see imports will lower and that excess demand has been holding steady and possibly maybe improving a little bit again if we see that infrastructure build and other things that are happening, some of the results frankly said it was the devastation from the hurricanes that might though result in a little bit more demand on rebars like we build parts of areas devastated.","So all said we think it will pick up a little bit and we love to continue to keep the imports down, you asked a question about 232, so I think so I can take just a minute of your time and I will share with you my thought, you summed it up well.","I said this many time, I\u2019m getting a little concerned about the length of time and taking for this to be implemented and I\u2019m concerned about the surge of illegally traded imports that are coming in as a result of the delays.","With that said, I\u2019m still confident that President Trump will fulfill his commitments to our ","industry and that we will see 232 hopefully early part of next year absolutely may be there will be a nice Christmas gift to the industry and we will see at the end of this year.","But certainly needed and it has been, we have a commitment to get it and I think as you look at some of the things that are happening even outside of our industry, for example with the Whirlpool 201, which is a different action of course but still points to severity of the imports and the type of holistic remedies that can be offered by Washington and we\u2019re counting on getting one from the steel industry.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Novid Rassouli, Cowen and Company.","Novid Rassouli","Just to stay on imports for another minute. So are you guys surprise to see imports I guess as high they are given the import arm is pretty much non-existent now and when do you expect imports to return back to a more normalized level as a percentage of the U.S. market?","John Ferriola","We're not surprised at all at this surge not at all, and the reason is that we see all of the countries and companies that are looking to beat because they know they\u2019ll be some form of trade relief. They\u2019re looking to get every product, every time in that they get in before we either go to the 232 or we continue to win these trade cases that we\u2019re winning.","Whether we get 232 or not, we're going to continue to prosecute trade cases with the same vigor that we have over the last 12 to 18 months. And I\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to continue to see the types of wins that we\u2019re seeing. And apparently saw these countries that are breaking our lots because there is only everything that can to get their product in here before that goes into effect.","So I\u2019m not surprised to see this surge, I think it\u2019s a direct result of commitment that was made by President early in the year a belief that he was going to go into a Fed sometime in the June time period as was indicated. And with every month that passes that doesn\u2019t go into affect always say it\u2019s continued so to get their product and before something goes into effect.","Now the one thing that we\u2019ve been talking of lately in Washington and certainly I have been sharing with the administration is our belief that this should be vocal about the about the fact that these - any results of 232 should be applied eventual actively to the time period when the President made his first commitment back in the early part of the spring of this year.","We think that frankly is the right thing to do, but also we believe that if he were \u2013 or the administration were to make that kind of commitment it, would put an immediate end to the search and therefore we would not see the damage occurring to the industry who love the administration and took the time it needed to complete the study of the 232.","So that\u2019s something I want to mention because that\u2019s something we\u2019ve been pushing very hard in Washington I don't know if we\u2019ll get it but we\u2019re pushing it very hard with the administration.","Timna Tanners","And John that will be some essentially like critical circumstance on the AD\/CVD duty side I think those are the rules for critical circumstance?","John Ferriola","It would be exactly the rules for critical.","Jim Frias","I probably should have said easier about just saying we want the same rules applied to 232 that do exist for critical circumstances. And I got to tell you this is critical circumstances, I mean you even the G-20 has come out and they called the crisis in steel today a crisis, okay that needs immediate action that\u2019s the G-20. And the OECD that\u2019s made a very similar comment and I\u2019ll just point out this is that the United States are suffering through this surge and results follow the capacity in China.","It\u2019s Europe and Europe is quietly quickly taking action then we are then moving much quicker on to get relief for their steel industry, as well as other regions. India just recently a few months ago put tariffs on all of the Chinese products that come into the country so it\u2019s a global problem other regions are reacting much quicker than the United States sadly which means that we remain the market that they can get in to while our government is dealing more slowly with the issues that other government have dealt with more quickly.","Timna Tanners","If you don\u2019t mind one quick follow-up, so switching to pricing we've been seeing HRC prices weakening recently, I would assume that you said your primarily due to this high-level imports can you just walk us through kind of fundamental drivers and what you're seeing from your seat as to why maybe why the market will accept and enable the recent price hikes to stick? Thanks John.","John Ferriola","I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re talking about price hikes on sheet products and\u2026","Timna Tanners","Yes correct.","John Ferriola","We watch demand curve very carefully here and we believe that we\u2019ve seen it bottom out. A couple of things that are coming into effect here we see the imports on HRC been drifting down while demand remains constant to drifting up a little bit. So at the end of the day it's always about supply and demand and then we see the market picking up or entry over the last two weeks we\u2019ve seen increased significantly. We feel good about the demand level going into the fourth quarter and particularly into 2008.","One area that I would mention in particular is in the oil and gas, that whole market as the energy market has improved much more quickly than we expected to and that\u2019s a particularly strong dynamic for Nucor as to our acquisition of Gallatin we serve that market very heavily.","So with oil and gas picking up a little bit imports are down a little bit although automotive has kind of slowdown a little bit, we expect that to slightly pickup again as a result of some of the sadness associated with the hurricanes coming both in Florida and in Texas.","We do estimates of anywhere from 700, 1000, to 1 million vehicles that are going to need to be replaced. The one last point that I would make is we didn\u2019t touch upon it too much but in relation to the automotive market picking up Nucor participation in that market and the grades that we continue to develop and offer to that market I feel confident it\u2019s going to help our sheet business.","And final point would be that when you look at the MSCDI inventories to sheet products, they have been drifting down in a fairly low level now which we again believe bodes well for fourth quarter and first quarter next year.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Phil Gibbs, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Phil Gibbs","I just have a clarification on the micro mill investments, you mentioned Illinois and Ohio is targeted regions for expansion. Are we talking about both\u2026?","John Ferriola","We talked about those two states as areas where we look to invest to expand our merchant products. We talked about other states five or six other states that we're looking at for the rebar though Ohio and Illinois we\u2019re looking at as potential areas to invest, to expand on merchant product offerings.","Phil Gibbs","So we would be looking at new capacity than in both merchants and rebar if I\u2019m hearing you correctly.","John Ferriola","You're definitely correct.","Phil Gibbs","And would you expect us to display other capacity within your system or is this a thought whereby you want to grow production?","John Ferriola","We want to grow production, now having said as we have a complete plan that place those tip, that takes into account all of our facilities there\u2019ll be some rearranging of markets, they\u2019ll be some plants where we shipped product as a result of this new capacity and rebar. We\u2019ve taken a holistic view of this. We've done a study of all of our merchant and our rebar decisions and how we led our markets and I don\u2019t want to get too many details out here and I am going to.","But yes, this is really a function of more fully utilizing our melt in each of our areas and better matching the product offerings in each region to the markets in that region. And as we shift things around, we\u2019ll be taking - we mentioned the word logistics several times here today because we kind of done a study and taken a hard look at how do we match our product offerings to the market that the - from a geographical perspective in which they are located and how can we rearrange that offering optimize on this or minimize on logistical costs.","And at the end of the day we said this how many times, Nucor continues to be the low-cost producer in merchant and rebar and frankly in all of products and we continue to drive that cost lower and lower at the end of the day specially in the world with excess capacity, the low cost producer is going to be the winner and here the Nucor believe and continues improve of the continuously look for ways to drive that cost even lower.","This is an example of it. The team has a got a great data. The long product group has done a great job at making a detailed market study and now we\u2019re going to be implementing the changes that result in that study.","Phil Gibbs","And most of the micro mill investments we've seen have been around I want to say between 300 and 400,000 tons, should that be what we\u2019re thinking about right\u2026","John Ferriola","Yes in that neighbor, we\u2019re not going to give out any specifics at this point but yes in that neighborhood, it would be fair to make that comment.","Phil Gibbs","And if I could ask a second here just maybe it\u2019s a good segue in both merchant bar and beam but a few weeks ago Nucor had severely cut list prices into the fourth quarter I was just thinking about what the rationale was behind that from a timing standpoint. And should we think there is going to be a little bit of pressure on pricing in fourth quarter? Thanks.","John Ferriola","I can answer it very simply. The rationale behind it was the fact that our book prices have been targeted by our competitors who offer discounts off of our book price and our book price was becoming not relevant to the market. And so we got it and make it more relevant to the market and as a result of it becoming a little bit less relevant to the market, we lost the market share in the third quarter.","And that\u2019s greatly upset me okay, and I could tell you the instructions to the team going forward is that we were going to launch discount off our market price - our full price, excuse me. But I watch discounting offer our book price much more closely and react any discounting off our book price much more quickly as we move forward. So that we always have a relevant book price so that pertains to beams, merchant and rebar. Did that answer your question?","Phil Gibbs","Yes, you confirm my suspicion I thought you were unhappy with something and I was right okay.","John Ferriola","Okay, while your suspicion was correct.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ferriola for closing remarks.","John Ferriola","Thank you. Let me close by as I usually do by saying thank you. Saying thank you to our shareholder, we appreciate your confidence and your support. Thank you to our customers. We appreciate the opportunity to earn your business every day and we will continue to work hard to earn this business every day.","And I also want to say thanks to my Nucor teammates for creating value for our customers, generating attractive returns for our shareholders, and building a stronger future for all of us and our families. And most importantly, thank you all for doing it safely. Thank for your interest in our company. Have a great day.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Please go ahead, sir.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. We appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team: Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman, Dave Sumoski, and Chad Utermark.","Our leadership team in Charlotte would like to thank everyone on our Nucor Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit, Steel Technologies, and Skyline Steel teams for a job well done in the second quarter. Taking advantage of our unrivaled competitive position and our highly flexible business model, you are positioning Nucor to thrive today and most importantly in the years ahead. Thank you.","CFO, Jim Frias, will now review Nucor's second quarter performance and financial position. Following those comments, I will update you on the execution of our strategy for long-term profitable growth. Jim?","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thanks, John. Second quarter of 2016 earnings of $0.73 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.70 per diluted share. This performance represents a significant improvement over first quarter 2016 earnings of $0.22 per diluted share and year-ago second quarter earnings $0.39 per diluted share.","Second quarter results included a LIFO charge of $19 million which was in line with our guidance. This compared with the first quarter of 2016 charge of $28 million and a year-ago second quarter credit of $96 million. Our steel mill segment was the primary driver of our second quarter profit improvement with the largest gains at our sheet mills.","Quarter-over-quarter profit growth was also achieved at our plate and bar mills. Nucor's Steel Making Operations benefited from both volume growth and higher metal margins.","Second quarter total steel mill shipments increased 5% over the first quarter of 2016. Our overall steel mill metal margin expanded by $16 per ton in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.","Our downstream products segment also delivered strong earnings growth in the second quarter from the first quarter and 2015 second quarter levels. Nucor's steel products business benefits from our market leadership positions and our diversified product portfolio. The strength of Nucor's downstream products business model allows us to profitably leverage a modest improvement in non-residential construction markets.","Performance at our raw materials segment also improved in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. David J. Joseph Company scrap brokerage and scrap processing businesses were solidly profitable in the second quarter. The improvements at DJJ's recycling business were three-fold. First, scrap pricing improved. Second, utilization and volume flows increased to support our steel mills' increased production. Third, our scrap processing team has done excellent work achieving efficiency improvements and cost reductions throughout their operations.","Our direct reduced iron or DRI facilities achieved significant quarter-over-quarter improvement in their financial performance. At the same time, our raw materials teams continued to enhance Nucor's overall profitability by working with our steel mills to optimize the cost of their iron units, Maintaining Nucor's position as the low cost producer across our raw materials, steel making, and steel products businesses is an unrelenting focus for all of our teams.","Our tax rate can be confusing due to the impact of profits from non-controlling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was approximately 32.5% for the second quarter of 2016. Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 35% at the close of the second quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $2.3 billion, which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion.","Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until 2021. Nucor is the only North American headquartered steel producer to hold an investment grade credit rating.","Our capital allocation priorities are clear. They have been consistently and effectively practiced over Nucor's entire history. Our first priority is to invest for profitable long-term growth that delivers attractive returns on our invested capital.","Our second priority is to provide our shareholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success in growing Nucor's earnings. Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase our stock when our cash position is strong and attractively-priced growth opportunities are limited.","We expect further strong improvement in earnings in the third quarter of 2016. The steel mills segment will benefit from contract pricing resets in the third quarter at our sheet mills. Contracts currently represent about 60% of Nucor's sheet mill volume.","The steel products segment continues to experience positive earnings momentum. Particularly strong profit growth is being realized at the Rebar fabrication and metal buildings businesses. All of our steel products teams are doing excellent work managing the challenge of this year's rising steel price environment. The raw materials segment's performance is expected to achieve profitability in the third quarter of 2016.","Our DRI facilities will be profitable, benefiting from improved product pricing, lower iron ore cost, and continued gains in yield performance. Our Trinidad and Louisiana plants are now consistently performing at what we believe to be world-class conversion cost levels. Our David J. Joseph Company's scrap business should also benefit from the more favorable scrap pricing environment that has been in place since the spring of this year. We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor shareholders.","We appreciate your interest in our company. John?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jim. Nucor's strategy for profitable growth is simple, flexible and focused. It is one that we've implemented for more than five decades. Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength to gain profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products. We are doing this by taking care of our customers, delivering an unrivaled value proposition for our customers is how we earn attractive returns on our shareholders' valuable capital.","Anchoring our strategy are Nucor's five drivers to profitable growth, they are: strengthen our position as a low cost producer; achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio; continue to move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher quality, higher margined, more import resistant products; expand and leverage our downstream channels to the market to increase our steel mills' base load volume, especially in weak markets; and achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength.","Our strategy for profitable growth is working. It is paying off today with the potential for much larger returns in the future.","I will now update you on highlights of our recent progress. Nucor's steel mill volume growth in 2016 highlights our success in gaining profitable market share. For the first six months of 2016, our steel mill production increased 13% over the year-ago period. That compared with the U.S. steel industries decrease of approximately 1% over the same period. This profitable growth did not just happen. It is the result of our highly flexible and low cost production capabilities, our unrivaled product breadth and diversity, our investments that have allowed us to move up the value chain, our execution of our channel to market strategy, and most importantly, the hard work done by my more than 23,000 Nucor teammates.","The best news is that we are far from finished executing our strategy. There's a lot more to come. We are adding cylinders to Nucor's engine for generating higher highs and higher lows in earnings and cash flow. As always, our objective is delivering attractive returns on our shareholders' valuable capital.","Demand is growing for our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mills new wide light products. After shipping approximately 160,000 tons of wide light products in 2015, Berkeley is on track to ship about 270,000 tons in 2016. That's up from their earlier target of 240,000 tons for this year. This wide light product capability is allowing us to produce more grades of advanced high-strength steels for the automotive market. We are also using a wide light products to gain share in a number of other targeted markets ranging from appliance to motor lamination to welding wire.","Now, our Nucor-Yamato joint venture is continuing to expand its value-added structural steel product portfolio. Last year, Nucor-Yamato began shipping its wider sheet piling sections. These wider sections are lighter and stronger covering more area at a lower installed cost. Prior to our entry, this market had been largely served by imports.","Nucor-Yamato is marketing new sections to our piling distribution business, Skyline Steel. Nucor-Yamato's NZ sheet piling sections are already enjoying strong marketplace success. Through the first half of 2016, shipments on the new wide sheet piles have more than tripled to over 19,000 tons. Two of the four wider sheet piling product groups have now been commercialized. The two other groups will enter production by the end of this year.","Nucor-Yamato's goal over the next several years is to grow our wider sheet piling annual volume to 100,000 tons. Nucor-Yamato is nearing completion of another growth initiative expanding its value-added structural steel product offerings. A $75 million project, adding Quench and Self-Tempering technology, will position Nucor-Yamato as the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams. Our initial trial production is scheduled to start in September.","Trials across the entire range of high-strength, low-alloy beams are expected to be completed by the end of next year's first quarter. These beams allow the use of lighter foot weights, which reduces the weight and cost for the builder, that enhances the competitiveness of steel versus concrete and wood. Nucor-Yamato's target over the next several years is to grow its high-strength, low-alloy beam annual volume to 50,000 tons.","During the second quarter, our Memphis SBQ bar mill completed installation of its heat treating equipment and began running trials of new value-added products. This expands our capabilities to include quench and tempering as well as the kneeling of bars from 2 inches and 1.5 inches to 12 inches in diameter.","I would like to thank our SBQ bar mill and downstream cold finished bar teams for their excellent work maintaining profitability in adverse market conditions, while also building for future growth with their numerous initiatives moving us up the value chain.","During the second quarter, our Vulcraft\/Verco joist and decking business announced plans to expand its geographical reach into Canada. Vulcraft Canada, our first Vulcraft facility in Canada will be located near Hamilton, Ontario. It will manufacture steel joist, joist girders and decking. We expect to start producing deck by the end of this year, with joist production starting in the first quarter of next year. Effective implementation of Nucor's vertical integration and channel-to-market strategy is a key competitive strength and an attractive growth platform for our company.","In June, Nucor formed a 50-50 joint venture with JFE Steel of Japan to build and operate a facility to produce galvanized sheet steel for the growing Mexican automotive market. The plant will be strategically located in Central Mexico. It's expected to have a cost of about $270 million. Operations are expected to begin in the second half of 2019. Annual capacity will be approximately 400,000 tons of galvanized sheet steel. It's important to note that Nucor and JFE will each supply an equal amount of substrate to be processed at the facility. We are excited to begin what we expect to be a long-term partnership with JFE Steel, a premier supplier of high-quality automotive steels.","Yesterday, we announced an agreement to acquire Joy Global's steel plate mill in Longview, Texas for approximately $29 million. Annual capacity of that facility is about 180,000 tons. The mill produces specialty plate products, ranging from 1 inch to 12 inches thick and up to 138 inches wide. Complementing our existing plate mills product capability reaching up to 3 inches thick and 120 inches wide, the Texas mill will enable Nucor to capture a growing share of niche value-added plate markets. We are confident, our plate commercial team will be able to leverage this expanded product portfolio to grow our overall plate business.","All of these investment projects have the same very simple objective, creating attractive long-term value for our customers, our teammates, and our shareholders. That discipline drives every capital allocation decision we make at Nucor. Our disciplined approach to being effective stewards of our shareholders' capital also requires that our team tackles significant challenges to our business.","To that end, Nucor continues to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing trade cases when and where it is appropriate. When farm producers and governments break mutually-agreed-upon laws governing trade, there must be meaningful consequences. Utilizing trade remedies is not protectionism. Trade enforcement is absolutely critical to drive the change towards a market-based system. A market-based system is one where our efficiency and innovation determine which producers win and which producers lose.","We are encouraged by recent actions taken by the U.S. government that paved the way for the imposition of much needed antidumping and countervailing remedies in some products against some countries breaking U.S. and international trade laws, but there remains much more work to be done. As always, Nucor is up to the challenge and we'll continue fighting hard for free and fair trade.","I would like to close my remarks by expressing my thanks to our teams at our DRI plants in Trinidad and Louisiana for what they have achieved for Nucor. Your facilities today produced the highest-quality and lowest-cost DRI in the world. Your hard work and perseverance are absolutely critical to our company's success in continuing to move up the value chain. Thank you, and please keep it going.","We would now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Matthew Korn with Barclays.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for taking my questions.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello Matt, how are you?","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I'm all right. I'm all right, John. So, we're all watching the import numbers carefully. I'm wondering, do your customers show indication to you and expectation that they think availability of imported steel is going to meaningfully increase over the rest of this year?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Actually, the feedback that we hear from our customers is that it's frankly the opposite. But our customers are telling us that when they look at the final landed price of the import offers, the difference isn't great enough to justify the risk. The other point that I would make is when you look at where we are in this \u2013 where we are this year, and our customers buying imports today, placing the orders today, can't really expect the deliveries until sometime in mid \u2013 somewhat \u2013 either early fourth quarter or mid-fourth quarter. And at that point, best time to think about the year-end inventories. So, I think, there's a bit of a hesitation to do too much on the ordering on the import side as a result of that concerns over their year-end inventories.","I also would point out a little bit about the \u2013 there's some availability issues and the volumes are less available that are out there today, a lot as a result of the trade cases, the successful prosecution of the trade cases that we've had particularly in sheet, but in some of our other products and also a concern that our customers have over the other trade cases that are currently in process. So, based on all of that information and from feedback we're getting from our customers, we don't see that as a major concern at this time.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thanks. It's very helpful. Let me follow-up this way if I could, on scrap...","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","...how do the flows to the shredders look so far this summer? So, when you look at the moving pieces, the export demand, or lack thereof, competition from cheap Chinese semis, the high utilization rates from you and the other EAF producers, do you see much upside risk to scrap prices over the rest of the year?","R. Joseph Stratman - Executive Vice President, Business Development","Matthew, this is Joe Stratman. Let me take a shot of that. The flows have been improved through the course of the year, as you might imagine. The increased demand from steel mills across the country raised prices, and with the price increases flow followed into the scrap yards, which is the normal trend.","At this point, with the currency exchange, the strength in the U.S. dollar, the weakness in Europe, in other words, so there's a lot of scrap available in Europe, and the Chinese billets moving around the world, the trade flows there, I don't see a lot of upside pressure on scrap. But similarly, the demand \u2013 the robust demand for domestic steel mills, I think, also keeps the demand side level, and that we have reached a pretty good point of supply and demand, where we would view a lot of stability in the last half of the year on scrap pricing.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And Joe, what I might add to that, when you think about our DRI facilities and the leveling effect that has to our company, and frankly, for the industry as well, as some of the pig iron imports that we've been bringing into the country also could be a stabilizing factor.","R. Joseph Stratman - Executive Vice President, Business Development","Absolutely, John. As I mentioned, the strength of the dollar and the supply available of scrap in Europe, but also as John mentioned pig iron, from both Brazil and from Eastern Europe, and Russia, the supply is pretty stable right now. And also, as John answered in the first part of your question, we think the demand outlook is also good and not negative in any way. So, supply demand on the scrap side should keep stability there for quite a while we think.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks, gentlemen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, Evan. How are you?","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Great. Doing well. Thanks. First question's on trade. We've seen some success on the sheet side. And I was wondering, what are the timing if we wanted to do more incremental work on trade on the sheet products? So, one thing that kind of comes to mind is we saw results from coated, some of the results from cold-rolled, and some of the countries are getting similar duties, not many, but Taiwan for example in coated.","And I think, we'll probably see some cold-rolled results pretty soon, maybe there'll be another hole or two there. For these types of countries already entering that, maybe some of the Taiwan offers are back in the market again, now that we've gone after them, and they kind of escaped at least this initial round of cases, how long does the industry have to wait before they can go after them, again, if they do to start to tick up in the future?","And then kind of the same question on countries that make cheap products that weren't named in the initial cases. Because maybe they weren't big suppliers of the U.S. market, but now that some other guys can't sell into the U.S market, they're stepping up and hearing just some talk about cold-rolled coming in from Vietnam and maybe a couple of the European countries, the numbers are starting to tick up a little bit. Is there anything preventing the U.S. industry from going after a fresh round of cases on the same product from different countries?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, to answer that question directly, the answer would be, no. Certainly, if we see an uptick, and the uptick comes with product that is priced at dump levels, then we believe that there's a violation of our trading laws, then we certainly would go \u2013 would go after that. And I know that about that.","The other point that I would want to make, proceeding to the question is when you mentioned there are other countries stepping into supply, such as Vietnam or some new suppliers, bear in mind that they're untested, they won't qualify in many of these applications, through extensive qualification period, and you're taking a larger risk. When you look at \u2013 and frankly, the pricing that's coming in is higher from those countries. So, when you combine the higher price with the increased risk with the less places where it can be applied because of qualifications, we don't see that much as of a threat. But, however, to your point, if we do see an uptick in it, and we do see it coming in at dump prices, or we see it coming in from countries that are receiving large subsidies from their governments, or in any other way violating our trade and international trade laws, then we are certainly free to take action.","And to your point about moving to the smaller suppliers, bear in mind to the fact that we were able to be so successful against the big boys, the big suppliers, the ones who were bringing in large volumes of steel at incredibly dump prices. When you take that out of the equation, we certainly don't have any problem competing with product coming in at fair prices from other countries as long as they adhere to the trade laws.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just a quick one for Jim. Corporate expense was pretty high this quarter, and I know it's very lumpy. Just wondering what might have been driving that, and if we should expect that to return that to normal by next quarter?","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Well, the biggest driver in the year-to-date difference is LIFO. LIFO went from $112 million credit to a $46.5 million expense. That's about $160 million swing of the total difference of $230 million, roughly. The next biggest drivers probably the profit on intercompany sales. We always have some volume of intercompany inventory at our downstream businesses. And with our steel mills having higher margins, we have to take a charge to write that inventory value down to its cost of production. And so, there's a takeaway there from the profits still in those segment.","And then finally, we do have a significant part of our pay across the company, including our profit sharing for the retirement accounts of our workforce, that's driven our profitability. It says probably $25-ish million of the difference is profit sharing and incentive comp being in spite of the fact we're making more money. It's a good thing, but more than that, number's changing, happy our shareholders are.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks for the color, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse.","Curt Woodworth - Credit Suisse","Hi. Good afternoon.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, Curt.","Curt Woodworth - Credit Suisse","John, I was wondering if you could just talk to the strength of your sheet order book right now. How are lead times looking, say, relative to a month ago? And there's been some discussion around \u2013 for you guys with quarterly contracts if the service center buyer wanted to try to pre-buy ahead of what is going to be a very sizeable increase in their ASP price. This quarter are you seeing any evidence of that?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Let me address your first question. When we look at our bookings on sheet, when we talk about cold-rolled and galvanized, frankly, they're rock solid. We are way out probably to...","Unknown Speaker","Late September.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...late September \u2013 somewhere around late September. So, we're looking really good on the cold-rolled and on the galvanized. On the hot-rolled side, we're seeing a little bit more pressure, but that being said, on the hot-rolled side, when we look at the service center inventory levels, they're extremely low. And with the reduced imports and some of our competitors shutting down operations, we see reduction in supply. So, although we are seeing a slowdown in the order entry rate for hot-rolled, and it's a little bit more challenged in cold-rolled or galv, we're still pretty comfortable with where we are in the hot-rolled market.","Curt Woodworth - Credit Suisse","Okay. That's great. And then second question just on sort of the M&A pipeline. It seems like there's definitely a hunt on for downstream acquisitions in the industry. And I think one school of thought has been, potentially trying to acquire pipe and tube assets to leverage the hot-band capacity that people have. Is that something that you guys would entertain, and can you just kind of talk to how robust your pipeline is right now for acquisitions?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we've mentioned several times that part of our bold strategy is to enhance our channels to the market, and with that, a very successful track record of utilizing our downstream operations, not only to get to the final customer as a channel to the market, but also as very, very strong profit generators in their own like. So, we're always open to that. I wasn't \u2013 we're open to many opportunities, always out there looking for where we can invest our cash for \u2013 in long-term profitable growth.","So, I'm not including anything, I'm not excluding anything, and I'm not going to comment anything in particular. But one area that we are focused on, and you'll be more from us as how we continue to increase on our hot rolled, which you mentioned specifically, where we would be with our hot rolled, we continue to invest in our hot rolled to a highest quality level. Some of the field work that we're doing in Gallatin today is investing to take it out of simply the pipe and tube market and get it into higher quality downstream businesses.","So, general answer, we're interested in everything, we look hard at everything. You heard us say that we have a very focused and flexible investment strategy, growth strategy. And we'll look at whatever comes along. We don't have any strong preferences to any particular downstream business.","Curt Woodworth - Credit Suisse","And could you just remind us what your hot-rolled mix is relative to the value-add sheet in the sheet business?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. it's about \u2013 hot rolled is about 60% \u2013 60% to 65% of our total sheet business.","Curt Woodworth - Credit Suisse","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Good afternoon.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon. How are you?","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm great. Thanks. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about your product mix. If you could drill down, just looking at your data here, we're kind of surprised to see the structural number decline. And even the sheet number bounced a lot, I think, as was discussed, the 550 average is much lower than where the spot market's been, even just for HRC. And I know there's a lag, but are we missing something, or is there any other reason why that average sheet price is so much lower? Even looking at CRE numbers, I can't quite reconcile, and so just wondering, if you could give us a little more color?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you hit the nail in the head when you talked about our contract pricing. We have a very large percentage of our sheet business on the contract, and it does lag. And most people tend to just think about it as a single month lagging, but when you add into the lead times that are involved, you have to really extend that out a little bit. So, when it comes to the questions of pricing on sheet, I would say that without a doubt, the issue there is of large percentage of contract pricing, and we expect to have \u2013 to fix that up in the third quarter. So, we're looking forward to that happening. On the question about structural, we had a nice jump in our structural percentage from quarter-over-over last quarter. So, it's not unusual for us to see a smaller jump quarter-over-quarter in second quarter over first quarter.","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. But, Timna...","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you talk about the pricing on \u2013 yeah, okay.","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. Just a comment, overall demand for structural products year-over-year is up about 3% or 4%. Our Nucor shipments of structural steel is up about 15%. So, while quarter-over-quarter, we dropped just a tad, a significant part of that was some major outages that we had at Nucor-Yamato.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just to be clear, I was asking about prices. Are you \u2013 or was there may be a mix shift or something that caused that decline. Is that what you're saying?","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Obviously, mix can play a huge role in our pricing on our structural side, yes.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. Okay. And then last quarter, I asked a question, I'm going to ask the same one again, make it nice and easy for you. So, you're running at 2.4 million tons of sheet in the first quarter, and you're at 2.5 million tons. So, you did ramp up, as we discussed. But I'm still perplexed as the answer then you said was 11.5 million to 12 million annualized tons is more normal, and on an annualized basis, you're still running at 10 million tons. So question is, do you have spare capacity to run more sheet in light of these tight market conditions?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we have limited capacity serving our cold-rolled and galv. And I would say, we have some capacity available on hot rolled, as we look out past the next couple of weeks. One of the other things, Chad mentioned the issue of mix, and I'm moving the same thing up on the side of hot rolled. So, as we continue to shift our mix higher and higher on the value-added, a lot of that product runs slower on our mills, and we can deduce less number of tons. The poster child example of that would be at our Berkeley mill, with the wide and light product, moving into the advanced high strength steels. To produce the high strength steel product, takes a lot extra \u2013 takes extra time in the LMF, takes extra time in the vacuum tank degasser. And then, of course, running at those very light gauges, it takes extra time to run through the mill. So, it's basically a question of mix, more than anything else.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, if I understand, you're saying, on hot rolled, you may have a little more capacity, in general, but you're printing pretty full out on the more premium sheet rates, is that fair?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, exactly.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Jorge Beristain with DB. I guess, most of my questions have been asked, but maybe you could comment a little bit about \u2013 with the Big River plant coming up in the fourth quarter this year or 1Q 2017. The current supply tightness that we're seeing in the market, are you bracing for any kind of impact of new supply coming into the market?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you just found the panic to everybody in this room. We thought we thought one of our cell phones went off. Whosever phone that was? And that's what all the chuckering is about. Everybody reached for their cell phones in their pockets.","But, so going back to your question about Big River Steel coming on line, certainly, that will add supply. Are we concerned about it? We'll, it's a competitor, that's a good thing. We've had new competitors coming online and pass. Over the last several years, we deal with it. We're not afraid of competition. And I would say to you that frankly it's more than just equipment that comes online. It's \u2013 you got to have the relationships with the customers. You've got teammates who understand how to make the products. You have to \u2013 we have advantages, such as our diversity. An advantage that, I believe, we would have over them or other competitors is our vertical integration, and our ability to take advantage to that vertical integration. So, we'll \u2013 they'll come online, we'll deal with them. And one of the things that is nice about having extra competition that's coming from the domestic source is they do play by the same rules as us, and they can't cheat, and we like that. So I'll take extra competition from the U.S. suppliers and international on any day or week.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Sorry, and I have to apologize that was my phone, so I apologize, sorry.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Okay. Just trying to comment...","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Murphy's law. The other question I had was just maybe on supplier discipline within the U.S. market. Are you hearing that everybody is adhering to their official list prices, or could you comment a little bit about if there's any kind of breakdown of discipline?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I can't comment on what other suppliers are doing, and I won't. Okay. I can only tell you what we're doing about our \u2013 in our business, so if you have a question that's specific to Nucor, they have been answered, but I can't comment on what others are doing.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Seth Rosenfeld with Jefferies.","Seth Rosenfeld - Jefferies International Ltd.","Good afternoon.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Seth Rosenfeld - Jefferies International Ltd.","Can we talk a little more about the outlook for your DRI facilities? And can you talk a bit more, to what extent the improving outlook for Q3 earnings is driven by your input cost and sales expectations for the period versus yield improvements as Louisiana continues to ramp up? And looking further out, can you just comment on what the cost sensitivity would be potentially widening that galv prices looking forward? Can you just...","Ladd R. Hall - Executive Vice President","Yeah. This is Ladd. I'll take a shot at that. Without question, the biggest driver of our improvement in our DRI plants are our costs and our yield improvements. They've done a superb job down there, figuring out how to take a huge amount of yield loss and out of that \u2013 for all that; second, they continue to keep a very, very high level of quality. Our steel mills are using it \u2013 learning how to use the materials better and better. And in fact, most of our steel mills with that material, they can use it far above HPI and getting very close the same quality of what the pig really is. So, we're really excited about what that is.","And secondly, we don't really control the prices. Depends on ore prices, and pig prices, and scrap prices, so they have to be market competitive to do that. And to tell you that we're going to be profitable in third quarter at our DRI plants and based on our market really speaks highly of what those two plants have done.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I would add just one point to that, because you ask specifically about gas pricing. And you remember that with our deals on Canada. And we have some control over there, we have some ability to mitigate the impact of gas price increasing through our own supply in Canada.","Ladd R. Hall - Executive Vice President","Not to mention, we have a long-term gas contract in Trinidad.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good point also there. Thank you.","Seth Rosenfeld - Jefferies International Ltd.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Garrett Nelson with BB&T Capital Markets.","Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets","Have your CapEx or D&A expectations changed at all since last call? And could you also remind us what Nucor's companywide maintenance CapEx is?","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","We see that maintenance CapEx is in neighborhood of $350 million. And our outlook for the year remains the same, it's roughly $500 million for the year.","Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then on the steel mill's utilization rate, the 83% that you reported for Q2, are you still assuming the same nameplate capacity as you were before? Has that number changed a little bit?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Excellent question. And know that we're again \u2013 to get into the nuts and bolts, I'm not going to spend a lot of time giving further the details. But the rough answer to your question is, yes, we do keep that number constant, and that's something that we're evaluating right now as we look at how some others, we put their numbers. And we typically have the same number year-after-year-after-year, so that we can compare ourselves quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter. Others, see the typical mixes or what they anticipate their product mix to be to \u2013 for the quarter to generate a denominator, and then of course, their capacity utilization.","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","And I would add John, that our numbers are not a nameplate number, they're usually higher than the nameplate number, because at some point in time in history, we've usually gone above the nameplate number. And so, we typically report based on the peak, we could achieve in ideal circumstance with a perfect mix, not based on what the current market mix might be or other factors like that, that can influence the mix.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's absolutely correct. Frankly, we will be really disappointed if we hadn't generated production was what the nameplate said. Our goal is to exceed that at all times. Now, having said all of that, I will tell you that, the other thing that comes into play here is that, as I mentioned early in one of the other questions, mix is changing dramatically to higher quality, higher profitable products, as a result, they tend to run slower on our mills. So, we are taking a look at evaluating just where we are with that during the next quarter and perhaps resetting those numbers at the end of the year. I don't think \u2013 in fact, I'm sure we won't go to one where we'll change it quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter, we just \u2013 we don't think that's a fair way to represent our utilization. But we will evaluate where we are today based upon our new product mix that we are running the higher quality, slower running products on our mills.","Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets","Great. Thanks a lot for those comments.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","John, on the hot-rolled book, you mentioned there's a little bit of pressure there more recently maybe the lead times have come in. If they stay more limited after the summer slowdown, should we expect you guys to maybe pull forward some maintenance to maintain that sort of discipline in the marketplace? Because I know you probably have to take some in the fall anyways. Just trying to think about how you're viewing the situation?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We really only have one schedule right now, I think, for the quarter \u2013 it's actually not one that we pulled forward. It's one that we delayed back in June. We were planning to do some work. Ladd, you want to comment on where?","Ladd R. Hall - Executive Vice President","Yeah. We were planning doing some work at Crawfordsville, Indiana plant by end of spring, we skipped that. We decided to do a mini four-day outage this quarter. We'll probably still have a regular schedule on some time next late fall or early winter. But that's the only plan that we have right now .","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And to answer your question direct, we aren't anticipating changing of our \u2013 any of our maintenance shutdowns to deal with the issue. We don't think it's \u2013 we need to do that at this time.","Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","How long do you think, based on your field buyers, can hold off in terms of wanting to enter this standoff we're hearing about and seeing in the marketplace?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I can't answer that question. That's a question more for the buyers, but what I will point you to is when you take a look at the months on hand numbers, they're extremely low. When you talk about across all sheet products, months on hand is about 2.0, that's extremely low. We suspect that if you break that down, when you look at cold-rolled and galvanized, probably a little bit under that, maybe 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, so hot band might be somewhere around 2.2 or something in that area.","All of that said, that's still an extremely low number. Now, certainly buyers are hesitant to buy right now, there's a lot of things going on, but we think that as things settle down, as people start coming back from the vacations and they begin to look at what their plans are to the rest of the year, we expect them to buy \u2013 to get back into the game.","Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I appreciate all that color. And one of your competitors yesterday talked about some pre-buying in long products in the second quarter with maybe a little hangover effect in 3Q. I didn't seem to see that in your numbers. I think the bar and structural volumes are fairly consistent quarter-on-quarter. Anything that you could comment on there in terms of your business and that sort of comment?","James R. Darsey - Executive Vice President, Bar Products","Yeah. Phil, this is Jim Darsey. And while there were a little orders advanced in the second quarter, we see demand in the third quarter for merchants being steady, driven primarily by the continued growth in non-residential construction and the 2.7-month service center inventory. So, they are buying. And on the rebar side, demand \u2013 even though we have a lot of imports coming into the country, demand is fairly strong driven by construction. So we see rebar demand continuing, see a little price pressure there, and merchant bar just will continue on pretty stable.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I would add to that Jim, if I could.","James R. Darsey - Executive Vice President, Bar Products","Yeah.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That the fact that on the rebar, we do see a little bit of challenge there as you mentioned, because of the imports. So we remember that we have a downstream business that consumes about 1.4...","James R. Darsey - Executive Vice President, Bar Products","Yeah.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","..million tons in terms of our rebar, which puts us in on a really good position in terms of our rebar generation of sales.","James R. Darsey - Executive Vice President, Bar Products","Yeah, good point, John. Thank you.","Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Any comments you can make Jim or John on the structural business...","Chad Utermark - Executive Vice President-Beam & Plate Products","Hey, Phil. This is Chad.","Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, Chad.","Chad Utermark - Executive Vice President-Beam & Plate Products","Like Jim \u2013 and like Jim said, on the structural side of the business, as we head into the third quarter, demand is relatively flat, and we go in with a decent backlog. So, I would say, it's pretty much steady as we look forward.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And we are excited to begin to introduce our new products, our new \u2013 our piling sections will be coming out in the second half. The two remaining piling sections will be coming out during the second half of the year. And we are really excited to be able \u2013 to be introducing our QST product in the near future. That's going to be a big plus for our structural mills.","Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks everyone for the thoughts. Appreciate it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Aldo Mazzaferro with Macquarie.","Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, John. How are you?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Aldo. Thank you. How are you?","Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good, thanks. So, I wanted to ask a couple of questions. One, on the scrap business, and then on a couple of your growth initiatives. On the scrap side, since you have much more of a brokerage distribution setup, rather than shredding domestically and things like that, I'm wondering, does that give you an advantage to buy foreign scrap that other domestic scrap players might not be able to take advantage of...","R. Joseph Stratman - Executive Vice President, Business Development","Hi, Aldo. This is Joe Stratman.","Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah.","R. Joseph Stratman - Executive Vice President, Business Development","We certainly see it as an advantage. We do have an international reach through our brokerage team, our DJJ brokerage team. And we can bring scrap in from virtually all over the world, and we can bring scrap substitutes in from virtually all over the world. The advantage clearly is it provides us a great deal of flexibility to use all the resources across the globe to get the most cost-effective source of a raw material to, at times, that will be domestic scrap, at times, it will be international scrap substitutes. So, we certainly believe it's an advantage, and we certainly use it to our best advantage.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And not just on iron, that's right, we also do it on...","R. Joseph Stratman - Executive Vice President, Business Development","Yeah, we do the same thing, again, through the DJJ team, in cooperation with our steel mills. We do that also on ferro-alloys.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And that's what we're looking for. And bear in mind that in addition to processing and brokerage D.J. Joseph also has other businesses that serve us well. And their railcar businesses, I think, plus for us, that gives us some advantages. And I've always said this, and I still believe that D.J. Joseph is not just a scrap company, and a brokerage company, and a rail company, more important than anything for us, it's an information company. And they do a great job of extracting the price of iron units and alloys worldwide and helping us to understand what's going on in other countries in terms of consumption of product by the amount of fine units that are being consumed, alloys that are being consumed. So, it's a great information company that serve us extremely well","R. Joseph Stratman - Executive Vice President, Business Development","John, I think I'd add one other thing to that. One other advantage that compliments that is a large percentage of our steel mills have deep water access, so not only do we have the brokerage arm that can buy it, but we have a efficient way logistically to get into our facilities.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's great...","Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah. So, two other little questions, John, on the investment you made, the JFE joint venture in Mexico. Could you say why it's Central Mexico rather than Northern, and where would the substrate come from?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Certainly, I can tell you why Central America \u2013 I said, Central Mexico, excuse me, that's because that's where the customers are. We put the plant where the customers are. When you look at where the quality automotive companies are locating their production facilities, it's right in that same area, around Le\u00f3n and surrounding communities. So, we're placing this \u2013 we haven't decided exactly which town to put it in, but we're placing it in a location that's frankly surrounded by new automotive company \u2013 new automotive production that's coming in, around there. In terms of the substrate, about 50% of the substrate or 200,000 tons will be coming from Nucor, and 200,000 tons will be coming from JFE.","Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And then, one final one, John. On the little plating that you bought in Texas, $29 million of nice price. I'm wondering, do you have to spend any significant capital to get that running the way you want to?","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me say, I don't refer to it as a little plate company in Texas. Let me say, great plate company in Texas. And I'm very glad that you asked this question, because I want to take just a minute and to welcome all of our new teammates from Longview, Texas into the Nucor family. So, and then you who are listening to the call today, we're excited to have you onboard. Welcome.","I want to tell you, I was at that facility yesterday to \u2013 frankly, to welcome everyone into the company, and to hover around and walked around that facility, that's a great \u2013 it's a great facility. We've had it at a very good price, okay, a very fair price. And if you work it out, it's about $161 a ton for a plate mill, and that's pretty good price.","Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Why do we \u2013 why are we doing this? Well, there's a lot of good reasons, number one, and Chad, you can jump in if I miss any here \u2013 but number one, just from a sizing perspective, it really fills a void that we've had in our portfolio. We want to be able to offer our customers a full range of plate products. And currently today, we go up to, I think, I'm going to get right, correct me, if I'm not, three inches in thickness and 128 inches in width. And with the facility Longview \u2013 we call Longview , okay, we'll be able to go up to 12 inches. And I believe it's 138 inches in width.","And beyond that, because they utilize what's known as a bottom chord ingot process, okay, you get extremely clean steels that allow us to sell into many, many high-quality, high-margin applications: military applications; naval applications; airplanes, I think they may break brackets for some of the airplane applications. Grade market, they go into well, heavy equipment market they go into. And then efficiency of production, they have an incredible heat treating and annealing operation. And if I have it correct, I think it's 18 heat treating facilities or, I think, bottom furnaces for heat treating.","And I'm going to tell you why, I spent \u2013 I visited there a couple of weeks ago. And I was asked again yesterday, as the goal, I mentioned all the great equipment they have, more importantly than any of that, they've got a great workforce, their culture is fantastic. It's a great cultural fit with Nucor. And if you can't tell by the tone in my voice, I'll tell you, I am really excited to have them join the Nucor team.","Chad Utermark - Executive Vice President-Beam & Plate Products","This is Chad Utermark. Just to add on to what John said about the specialty products that this mill is capable of making into these valuable niche markets \u2013 more value-added markets that we want to penetrate. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention our current North American commercial footprint that we already have in place and this great relationship we have with plate customers all across the United States, we're going to be able to bring this product to market very quickly. And like John said, I'm excited to have this asset, but more importantly, the team that's down there, what a great group of men and women, and we're excited about moving forward.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And you asked about capital. Frankly, there'll be some capital that we'll put in there \u2013 it'll be minus, as we get to know more about business. And we see new applications, we might be adding something down the road. But when I look beyond any major influx, they've got a good facility, they run it well, and we don't see major capital going into it. It's certainly doesn't require.","Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you, John. Thanks. Congratulations on a good purchase.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alessandro Abate with Berenberg.","Alessandro Abate - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Good afternoon, gentlemen. I have just one question, which is related to the one that my colleague just asked, related to the acquisition of the heavy plates from Joy Global. How does it fit into your portfolio, if you can actually give us a recap of the heat treating capacity that you have within your mills, and what this acquisition may mean in the middle of \u2013 because, clearly, in the U.S. the plate market is the one that's suffering the most of the capacity and weakness in the line segment. In this respect, do you see any kind of potential consolidation among the plates division of your competitors. Thank you.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we can't comment on what our competitors are going to do, but I'll be happy to comment on your question about how does that fit in with our organization. Well, we talked a little bit about it in terms of just \u2013 in top of markets and more challenging markets, what you want to have is additional products that fit into niche markets. And that's exactly what we're buying here, or we have here.","As we mentioned, several of the applications, these are really high-quality specialized application. We're talking about brackets that go on the airplanes for the landing gears. That's kind of important. And I want to just fill a little bit more on what Chad said also that, look, we're going to have tremendous commercial leverage here. We sell nationwide. We've got a great commercial team out there selling plate. It wasn't the focus of Joy Global, so they didn't have the same focus on selling it outside their internal needs, and we do.","So, we're going to be taking the commercial leverage for a whole another level. And just one final point that I would make in that decision, it might be weak right now, and well, frankly, it's not that weak, okay. But, we do all the \u2013 those investments that we make up for the long-term profitable growth of our company, and we wanted to be sustainable. And, we believe that the best way to do that is to continue to grow our diversity, continue to grow our market leadership position in the markets in which we participate and this fills those builds perfectly.","Alessandro Abate - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Thank you. Just \u2013 if I may, just a quick follow-up. Can you just remind me how much you have in terms of heat treatment capacity and the quench and temper plates for the mining industry.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well. We would \u2013 we can't, I don't know the number for exactly \u2013 given the new acquisition \u2013 without the new acquisition.","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Without the new acquisition, it's 240,000 tons.","Alessandro Abate - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Okay. Thank you very much. And congratulations on the purchase. It's really a great deal. Thank you.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Andrew Lane with Morningstar.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Research","Hello, good afternoon. A couple of DRI-related questions, as usual. First, if you were to take a step back and look at the Louisiana DRI project from a big picture perspective, how did your outlook changed over the last year regarding what benefits it might ultimately provide in sort of a mid-cycle environment? It seems like we have come a long way from when it was nearly idle after some maintenance last year.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I will start, and Ladd you can jump in here. Clearly, when we started up, as we do it with many new facilities, there's a learning curve. There tends to be some challenges on equipment, there were, in this case. Actually that had nothing to do with the technology. We still have a great deal of confidence in the technology. This was an exemplary piece of equipment. And we even saw the issues, I guess, here. So, we got \u2013 we worked our way through the equipment issues. And now, I would say, that it's fitting into our strategy exactly the way that we anticipated it fitting into. It increases the flexibility of our raw material strategy.","Remember that \u2013 and I know, you all probably know this, but remember that when you look at iron units, it represents about 60% of our total cost of production, that's a huge portion of our total cost of production. So, the more flexible we are, the bigger the basket of choices we have to use when we select the lowest cost mix to put into our furnaces. It gives us a tremendous cost advantage to our competition. And we still feel very strong, and this was a great long-term investment.","I'll remind everyone once again that we did build Louisiana with the infrastructure to support a second facility. And I'm convinced that long term, okay, as we continue to see prime scrap become more difficult to obtain and degrade in terms of the quality of the \u2013 a prime scrap that's available for our furnaces. And as we continue to move further and further up into the high quality products, where we need more and more virgin or very pure iron units, I'll tell you what, we're going to be very glad that we have this, and we're finally going to be looking to add some more.","Ladd R. Hall - Executive Vice President","Maybe just one comment to that, John. And although we're very excited to see the divisions profitable, sometimes, I think we lose sight of the fact what it does for our steel mills, as far as moderate their costs and allow them, as John has talked about, be significantly more flexible than they've ever been before. So, it's not just a benefit to the DRI plants, it's a huge, huge benefit across our consumer mills.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Research","Okay. Great. And...","R. Joseph Stratman - Executive Vice President, Business Development","And Andrew, I'll add one more comment, if I could, this is Joe Stratman. Your question really said it right? How does it look mid-cycle, which is we're entering more of a mid-cycle, where the prime scrap \u2013 the cut scrap spread is starting to get back to historical norms. And as John said, the quantity and quality of prime scrap in the United states will continue to deteriorate. That mid-cycle comment of yours is spot on, that we're starting to hit the sweet spot of the value of what that DRI plant could do for us.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And as we go from mid-cycle to long cycle you can get better, so...","R. Joseph Stratman - Executive Vice President, Business Development","Amen. All right.","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you for your question.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Research","Could you update us on the current utilization rates, at both Trinidad and Louisiana as well?","Ladd R. Hall - Executive Vice President","This is Ladd, we're full.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Research","Okay. And then...","John J. Ferriola - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Still running for both facility.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Research","And then maybe I missed it earlier, but just finally, could you remind us on your 2016 CapEx guidance please?","James D. Frias - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","It's $500 million.","Andrew Lane - Morningstar Research","Okay.

Please go ahead, sir.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Thank you. Good afternoon. This is Dan DiMicco, Nucor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team: our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Ferriola; Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey over our Long Products and Bar Products; Keith Grass over our David J. Joseph and Scrap Operations; Ladd Hall over our Flat-rolled businesses; Ham Lott over our Downstream and Fabrication businesses; and Joe Stratman, who is responsible for our Beam and Plate businesses as well as our business development group.","First and most importantly, as always, we like to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for your hard work in today's extremely challenging economic and steel market conditions. We are extremely proud of your unrivaled commitment to taking care of our customers. Every day, you are building a stronger and more profitable Nucor, and as always, you are doing it by working safely and by working together. You are Nucor's greatest asset and our real competitive advantage, the right people. Thank you all very much.","I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to discuss our third quarter results and financial position. Following Jim, John Ferriola will report our Nucor's operations and growth strategy. And then I will wrap up with some thoughts. Jim?","James D. Frias","Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. Third quarter 2012 earnings of $0.35 per diluted share were at the high end of our guidance range of $0.30 to $0.35 per diluted share. Third quarter results were negatively impacted by 2 noncash charges totaling $0.10 per diluted share. $0.06 per diluted share resulted from inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments associated with our acquisition of Skyline Steel, which we acquired at the end of the second quarter. We expect those charges to be much lower in the fourth quarter. We also recorded a noncash charge of $0.04 per share resulting from a loss on the sale of assets of Nucor Wire Products Pennsylvania.","A quick comment about our tax rate since it can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting out profits belonging to our business partners, the third quarter of 2012 effective tax rate was 35.9%. Overall market conditions softened further in the third quarter. In addition to slowing economic growth both domestically and globally, steel imports into the U.S. have increased significantly in both 2011 and again in 2012. The sheet market has been further pressured by new domestic capacity that began ramping up in 2011.","For Nucor, these market conditions were evidenced by a 5% decline in production and a 3% decline in shipments at our steel mills from the second quarter. Operating rates at our steel mills fell to 71% in the third quarter from second quarter's rate of 76%. However, challenging steel markets highlight the value of Nucor's business model, particularly our highly variable cost structure and our diversified product portfolio. Our profitability in the just-completed quarter was supported by relatively more stable results from our bar and beam mills when compared to the profit declines at our sheet and plate mills.","Additionally, our downstream steel products business reported its second consecutive profitable quarter after being unprofitable for the preceding 13 quarters. Another key strength of our business model is Nucor's ability to generate healthy cash flow through cyclical downturns. In contrast to a 43% decline year-over-year in the first 9 months of 2012's net income, cash generated from operations increased more than 60% over the same period to $1.1 billion. Nucor benefits from a countercyclical cushion provided to our cash flow as lower scrap and steel prices reduced our working capital investment during downturns.","Nucor's consistent cash flow performance is also helped by our highly variable cost structure. Balance sheet strength remains another important attribute of Nucor's business model. Standard & Poor's, in its October 2 quarterly report entitled North American Metals and Mining Companies, Strongest to Weakest, again ranked Nucor #1 for credit rating and credit outlook among a universe of 62 companies. Nucor was the only steel company in the group that S&P awarded a strong business risk profile due to our competitive position and profit performance relative to our peers. We are the only steel producer in North America to enjoy the extremely important competitive advantage of an investment grade credit rating. The benefits of our credit rating include a lower cost of capital, financial flexibility and our position as the lowest risk counterparty for both our customers and suppliers.","Our natural gas working interest investment to support Nucor's raw material strategy is an excellent example of how financial strength pays off for Nucor. Cash, short-term investments and restricted cash totaled $2.5 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2012. That was an increase of $365 million from the second quarter of 2012. This improved liquidity was driven by our strong operating cash performance during the third quarter.","Further to Nucor's strong liquidity, our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is undrawn, and it does not mature until December 2016. We have no commercial paper outstanding. At the end of the third quarter, long-term debt totaled $4.3 billion. In the fourth quarter, our leverage is declining. On October 1, we paid off maturing debt of $350 million, and in December, we will be paying off an additional $300 million in debt.","As a result of our strong cash flow performance, we expect year-end 2012 cash, short-term investments and restricted cash to exceed $1.5 billion. We will maintain the strong liquidity position in a year when we invest almost $750 million in acquisitions, invest an estimated $1 billion in capital expenditures and pay off $650 million in debt maturities. That is a total of $2.4 billion in cash outflows in 2012 with most of it targeted on increasing our earnings power. It is a long tradition of Nucor to grow stronger during downturns. We're able to do this because of our financial strength and the long-term approach we take to managing our business.","Through the first 9 months of 2012, capital spending totaled $692 million. The majority of the capital is going to a number of growth investments. The largest project is our Louisiana direct reduced iron raw materials facility currently under construction. There are many other projects being implemented throughout our upstream, steelmaking and downstream businesses to develop new products, increase quality and reduce costs.","Skyline Steel, acquired in June for a cash purchase price of approximately $675 million, is off to an excellent start as a member of the Nucor family. This acquisition brings together Skyline, the North American market leader in the distribution of steel piling products and Nucor-Yamato, North America's leading producer of steel piling products. The combination of these organization expands Nucor's opportunity for profitable growth in the steel piling business. Skyline has been immediately accretive to Nucor's cash flow and is expected to be accretive to our earnings in the fourth quarter.","For the fourth quarter of 2012, we expect to see a reduction in earnings exclusive of onetime charges from the third quarter level as a result of the ongoing trend, the economic softness in the global economy. Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance in the final month of the quarter. Dan?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Thank you, Jim. I'll now ask John Ferriola to report on Nucor's operations and the implementation of our growth strategy. John?","John J. Ferriola","Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. Let me begin by thanking all of our raw materials, steelmaking and steel product teammates for your outstanding commitment to working safely and to taking care of Nucor's customers. Thank you, and please keep it going.","We are extremely excited about the impressive work being done by our raw materials, steelmaking and downstream product teams during these bad times to prepare Nucor for the good times ahead. Here are some third quarter highlights from a few of the projects currently underway to grow Nucor's long-term earnings power.","Our Hertford County, North Carolina plate mill team successfully brought their new vacuum tank degasser online during the third quarter. New grades requiring degassing are now being trialed and made available to our plate customers on a regular basis. Coming next to Hertford County will be a new normalizing line that is scheduled to start up by the middle of next year. These value-added investments build on the outstanding success of the mill's heat treat line that began operations last year. In the third quarter, the heat treat line again delivered record shipments, and our heat-treated plate products have largely avoided the severe pricing pressure of commodity grade imports.","Nucor's sheet mills also continued to move up the value-added chain. Our Hickman, Arkansas team will start up a new vacuum tank degasser within the next 3 weeks. The degassing will allow Hickman to participate in the higher value-added OCTG products market along with opening new opportunities in Mexico.","Our Decatur, Alabama team continues to run very successful trials in the automotive market using their world-class galvanizing line to produce parts for several of the new domestic auto producers. Our Berkeley County, South Carolina team is moving ahead with their new wide and light project. It will allow Berkeley to produce up to 72-inch wide material and light gauge down to 0.042 inches. Equipment orders have been placed, and construction is underway. We expect this project will be up and running in late 2013.","In the third quarter, our David J. Joseph team began operating 2 new nonferrous metals sortation facilities, 1 in Florida and the other is located in Kentucky. These investments allow DJJ to maximize the profitability it realizes from its recycling of obsolete scrap. Another noteworthy DJJ third quarter achievement was the recognition of our Salt Lake City, Utah recycling facility by OSHA's SHARP program. The Safety and Health Achievement Recognition program or SHARP program for short represents the gold standard for safety excellence and recognizes companies that voluntarily go to the extra mile to meet rigorous safety standards.","Our team at Nucor Steel Louisiana made excellent progress during the third quarter on the construction of our new DRI plant in St. James Parish. Their can-do attitude and high energy level allowed them to overcome significant challenges arising from this summer's record low level of the Mississippi River. Two major milestones reached this quarter were the placement of the DRI vessel on the structural module that supports it and the erection of the iron ore storage domes. Most importantly, we are in schedule for a mid-2013 startup of DRI production.","Our Louisiana DRI project is a huge step forward, implementing Nucor's raw materials strategy. Combining Louisiana's annual capacity of 2.5 million tons with our Trinidad plant's 2 million tons of annual capacity brings us to about 2\/3 of our goal to control from 6 million to 7 million tons of annual capacity in high-quality scrap substitutes.","Successful execution of our raw materials strategy, our DRI production capability, PED, with our long-term and low-cost supply of natural gas is a game changer for the cost structure of Nucor's Steelmaking Operations. It does more than just support our growth in the higher-value added and higher-margin sheet in SBQ markets. Our investments in DRI production capacity and in natural gas assets will provide Nucor significant competitive cost advantages for raw materials and energy. The raw materials strategy is also a game changer by shortening our supply chain for high-quality iron units.","The Nucor team is in a position of strength to build on our company's proven ability to be effective stewards of our shareholders' valuable capital. As always, our success will be driven by the adaptability and sustainability of Nucor's business model. In everything we do, our focus remains on long-term sustainable growth and Nucor's profitability. We are continuing Nucor's historical and highly successful strategy of preparing for the good times during the bad times. Working together, our team is building an exciting and very rewarding future for all members of the Nucor family, our shareholders, our customers and our teammates. Thank you. Dan?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Thank you, John. The biggest near-term challenge facing Nucor and the entire U.S. steel industry is the current flood of steel imports into our country. Based on U.S. Census Bureau data, steel imports are on a pace to reach 27.7 million short tons for full year 2012. This represents an increase of more than 20% from 2011 imports of 22.8 million tons and more than 40% from 2010 imports of 19.3 million tons. Such increases are totally inconsistent with a domestic economy that is barely growing as well as a U.S. steel industry capacity utilization rate mired in the range of 70%.","Not only are we concerned about dumped and subsidized steel and steel products. We're taking action to protect our interest by asking our government to enforce rules-based free trade. A number of sunset reviews are pending or about to be initiated by the U.S. International Trade Commission. These include cases on galvanized steel sheet, rebar and hot-rolled sheets for a variety of countries. Maintaining these orders is critical to maintaining free and fair trade in the U.S. market.","And it's highly likely that new trade cases will soon be filed. The Nucor culture will always be proactive and aggressive in addressing all risks to our business. For that same reason, our team continues to take a leadership role in advocating real solutions to our nation's economic challenges. Our view of the situation is unchanged. The time is right and long overdue to reinvigorate the American economy by seizing new and exciting opportunities. They include capitalizing on our nation's vast energy resources, growing a globally competitive U.S. manufacturing sector ready to prosper on a truly level playing field and rebuilding our decaying infrastructure.","Long term, we are bullish in the profitable growth opportunities for the American economy and Nucor. That is why we're working hard to build a stronger Nucor. A stronger Nucor is one positioned to deliver higher highs and higher lows in earnings power to successive economic cycles. Our disciplined execution of our multipronged growth strategy has invested nearly $7 billion of our shareholders' valuable capital since the last cyclical peak in 2008. Those investments have dramatically increased our company's long-term earnings power. That is why our confidence has never been greater that Nucor's best years are ahead of us.","Thank you for your interest in Nucor, and we'd now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michelle Applebaum with Steel Market Intelligence.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","I wanted to also applaud you for taking the time in your release and in your script to talk about the issue of imports, to put that front center because you've got over $1 billion of projects that we could spend 90 minutes on. But this is an industry problem that is just plaguing everywhere you look. There's no place to hide. I wanted to address how that can be fixed because in my 30 years, I've only seen one time where action really made a huge difference, and that was the Reagan era VRAs back in the '80s. Is there a solution like that? And is there a real trade solution here?","Daniel R. DiMicco","The trade solutions that we have available to us have numerous facets, and I've mentioned several of them in my script. In addition to that, we are exploring some very new and unique ways to deal with these trade issues that I will not go into on this call. But rest assured that our trade of users [ph] have been hard at work to come up with new ways to deal with the abuse of our markets by trading companies and by foreign steel companies and countries, particularly state-owned enterprises. And we will continue to be very active on these issues along with the entire industry and many in our domestic manufacturing customer base. So just stay tuned, and over the next 6 to 9 months will be a number of things that will be obvious to people about the directions we're taking to deal with these issues. I would also suggest that VRAs are probably not the only time when we had a strong action on the part of our government to deal with a massive flood that occurred during these 2000 to 2003 time period. And there are opportunities for us to deal with this today with tools that are in toolbox and tools that will be added to the toolbox. In addition to that, we are working with our government to find more proactive ways to stop this before it becomes damaging. And that's enough said on that subject.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","Can I ask another question?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, certainly.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","Okay, I -- there's been a kind of overwhelming number of price increases for sheet this week, and there hasn't been anything since July. And I was just wondering if you could give us some color on what's prompting that.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, as you know, we don't really get into discussing the pricing situation, particularly on a short-term basis. And I'll leave John the opportunity to make some comments. John?","John J. Ferriola","In general terms, Michelle, when you look at sheet, first of all, the market was oversold. Pricing had reached unsustainably low levels. Also, when you look at the inventory throughout the supply chain, the inventory's low throughout the entire supply chain on sheet. Imports are down a little bit, and we're reaching a point where customers are beginning to place their first quarter business. So we've seen an improvement in our backlog, in our order entry rate. Right now, our lead times are out just about to December. So all of those factors played into making an announcement on sheet increases.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question, I guess, sort of following on the importing just slightly. Your prepared remarks, as well as in the press release earlier, it sort of called out imports and new domestic supply as kind of a headwind. But generally speaking, we've seen imports starting to trail off a little bit. We've had a big bankruptcy in the space as well, too. Do you believe that, that's enough to sort of readjust the supply-demand balance? Or do you need to see a little bit more capacity come out as well, too? I was just trying to understand sort of where you're thinking things are going from that perspective.","Daniel R. DiMicco","First thing we need is a recognition in Washington that the best way to get out of this mess that we're in, whether it be jobs or deficit spending, is to get increased revenues coming in from a stronger economy, and that will drive increased demand in steel sectors. Having said that, imports are not falling off significantly enough to have a major impact. We've got -- as I've mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's coming at an annualized rate of almost 28 million tons. That's ridiculous considering how much tonnage is actually being produced by the domestic producers that are operating in the low 70 utilization rates. So there's much more that needs to be dealt with there, and they will be dealt with. And in many cases, the penalties will be retroactive. And so as far as the domestic production and the shuddering at the present time with the RG assets, that's obviously a positive thing for the supply-demand balance, and it helps cushion the negative impact of the poor economy and the flood of imports that have come in. And as far as the new startups go, they're in a desperate situation. They're bankrupt. They're selling their assets, and they're behaving that way in the marketplace. Sooner they're sold, the better.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A follow-up question if I may. While iron ore prices have bounced in the last couple of weeks, they're certainly off from where they were. Given what's -- given your focus on DRI and so forth, has there been any thought or consideration to kind of some vertical integration as to maybe picking up some assets in that respect to sort of vertically integrate your operation at all?","Daniel R. DiMicco","We are thinking about a whole host of things all the time, exploring all different opportunities. And if we make a move in that space, it will be because the opportunity says it's the right price and the right time to do it. But we are constantly exploring opportunities throughout the downstream through the upstream space literarily on a daily basis.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And one last question. There's a competitor of yours out there talking about SBQ weakness and so forth. Is this something that you're seeing as well, too? Is it unique to them? Or I was wondering if you have some color on that market.","John J. Ferriola","There certainly has been some slowing in some of the markets of SBQ. In other areas, it's still significant strength. Automotive would be one example of that, and though heavy trucks are off a little bit from the peak where they were a few months ago, still fairly strong. So some SBQ markets have weakened for sure, but then there's others that we're very active in that have remained strong.","Daniel R. DiMicco","In general, the larger sections in the SBQ marketplace have been hit the hardest, and certainly, some competitors are more impacted by that than others.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So this won't necessarily impact the expansion of the Memphis [indiscernible] ...","Daniel R. DiMicco","No, no. We're -- what we're doing with our SBQ expansions in Memphis and at 2 of our other mills that focus on SBQ is based upon how we see the future. If it was based upon how we saw it today, we would probably stop them all. But we are very confident that we're going to see an influx of manufacturing coming back to this country for a host of reasons in sectors that are strong consumers of SBQ-type products and in the energy area as well. John?","John J. Ferriola","The other thing I would add, Dan, is that when you look at the investments we are making in SBQ, they're investments that get us into new products, new geographical territories, new applications with new customers. So even if the market remains a little stagnant, we have opportunities to grow in those areas.","Operator","Next we have Sohail Tharani from Goldman Sachs.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Dan, you are going to start the DRI mid-2013, so it means that you will not start looking for buying iron ore a few months before that. I was wondering if anything you've thought about, was it because there's some new capacity coming in, in the Minnesota region in the U.S. Also the pellets, would that be a good alternative? Or do you think you -- think that Brazil is the best source for you to bring pellets into the plan?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Currently, we buy pellets from 3 different pellet producers. Two are in Brazil. One is in Canada. The startup and the continued operation of Louisiana's first DRI plant will be supplied by those same suppliers and probably in similar percentages to what they do today for us. And we have been and are currently exploring other supply sources. And we will be successful in bringing out some additional supply sources from other parts of the world.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And continuing on that, remember you had mentioned that there's an opportunity to actually get to the resource and buy the resource or acquire the resource of iron ore. That would also be an option. But with the iron ore prices now weakening, do think that option's still on the table?","Daniel R. DiMicco","I think that the options become less expensive that are on the table, and that may exist for some period of time. And so again, we will be opportunistic. If we can get something that looks like it'll be a good long-term add to our raw materials strategy, we will take serious look at it. And you'll hear about it when it happens, if it happens. The opportunities -- We believe there'll be more opportunities for that going forward that will happen [ph] .","Operator","We have next Luke Folta with Jefferies & Company.","Luke Folta - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","First question, I think I read recently that Moody's had put Nucor on review for potential downgrade on the credit rating, and Jim talked about how important that is to you guys. I just kind of want to hear your thoughts on what you thought about that, number one, and then also if that factors into your view on how you look at spending opportunities over the next term here.","Daniel R. DiMicco","I'll let Mr. Frias to take a shot at that one. Jim?","James D. Frias","Yes, we are several levels above investment grade. The bottom investment grade is a BBB-, and we're right now on middle A, so we're like 5 brackets above the bottom. And we may end up with a split rating if Moody's does, in fact, downgrade us to a low single A. We will still have an A rating that's split. So we don't like the idea that it could happen, but it's a real possibility. We've always been committed to maintaining a strong credit rating, and we will remain committed to maintaining a strong credit rating. And there's a lot of different ways to achieve growth investments that don't always require issuing significant amounts of debt. So as opportunities come, we'll evaluate them from a number of different perspectives.","Daniel R. DiMicco","In addition, I would add to the comments that Jim made in his presentation, his prepared remarks, that the countercyclical cash generation that we benefit from is actually adding to our stronger cash position at the end of the year people might be forecasting. So that only serves to help us in regard to issues like you're talking about.","Luke Folta - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got you. Okay. And then I guess just secondly, I think you guys probably have as much insight into non-residential construction as any other company in the U.S. And I just wanted to understand your thoughts on -- typically we see -- the rule of thumb is basically that once housing starts to recover you get a lag, 12 to 18 months or whatever it is recovery in commercial construction. And I just wanted to get a sense on how you -- is there anything different that you see in this cycle that would result in that not happening?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, first off, people all like to focus on the positive when possible. I mean, when we see a nice uptick in the housing side of things, it tends be portrayed as good news, which it is. But relatively speaking, we're still at dismal levels overall. And so I think that this will -- it's something that is going to take longer to have a positive impact on the commercial construction than would have been normally the case coming out of recessions where housing had suffered. I have no idea exactly the timeline on that, but the way things are going in Washington with the lack of action on the economy, the dismal performance of the economy and job creation, the threats to the business community and the private sector, there's -- things are going to happen slower as long as that's the case. And hopefully, that won't be the case for a whole lot longer. Whoever wins the presidency, hopefully, they will do the right things to stimulate this economy and create job creation. And so we still see the nonresidential, which commercial would be a component, struggling. While our downstream businesses have been profitable now for 2 quarters in a row, as Jim mentioned, it's still a very weak environment out there. And we've got -- under the current set of circumstances, we've got a couple of years yet to deal with before we start to see strong non-residential construction market. Hopefully, we can -- we will be able to change that. I know we can change it if we do the right things. It remains to be seen if we will or not as a country.","Luke Folta - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can I ask one more quick one?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Sure.","Luke Folta - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just on Skyline, are the shipments that are going through Skyline showing up in your reported sales tons in your supplemental data? And also when the segment data is reported, is that going to be in the downstream segment?","John J. Ferriola","It will be in the steel segment. It is included in the tons right now.","Luke Folta - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Is it -- can you tell me which category?","John J. Ferriola","It will be in the structural.","Operator","Our next question is from Dave Martin with Deutsche Bank.","David S. Martin - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim and Dan, as you pointed out, you had a very good cash flow and cash quarter in the last couple of months, and some of this was due to asset investment sales. But I'm just kind of curious as to whether any of this may reverse in the fourth quarter if there's anything unusual.","John J. Ferriola","David, I would say very little of it had to do with the asset sales. The proceeds from the sale of wire products were in the tens of millions of dollars, in fact, less than 20, I think, as I recall. And so that really wasn't a factor. In fact, if the pricing trends that we've kind of seen in the pipe for steel was weaker in the second half, the third quarter, than it was in the first half, so we're starting off with a low pricing position, I would say the more likelihood is that we'll get another benefit in the fourth quarter from working capital. And so no, this isn't a onetime thing that's going to reverse direction. It's likely to get another little bit of pop of cash burst in the fourth quarter as well. Maybe not as big as third quarter, but still something there.","David S. Martin - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, just had a quick question on structural pricing, which was up in the quarter versus second, which looks a little odd. But was that -- is that just a function of Skyline?","John J. Ferriola","Yes.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","John was going through in detail with the projects and I kind of caught the part about auto and wanted to probe a little bit more. Given the additional investments you've been making there and the time frame for starting up late 2013, so I mean it's been a parable at least in the steel industry that the mini mills could never make auto-quality exposed sheet. Can you tell us if you're attempting to break down that expectation and what your plans are there?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Before John gives you details on your question, I will just repeat one phrase that I've always thought of as being very important: Never say never. If people haven't learned that after the last 30-plus years of mini mills in the steel business, then they have not been awake or alive until very recently. Never say never. John?","John J. Ferriola","And I will tell you with a great deal of confidence, we will be able to achieve that at some point. I go back to the history of mini mill steelmaking, and I remember when people told us we couldn't make garbage-can-quality steel. Look at the things that we're doing today in every aspect of our business. So the investments that we're making, the world-class galvanizing line, other investments, the wide and light project that we're working on, the degassers that we are adding virtually in every one of our mini mills, focus on moving up the value chain in our SBQ business, clearly we are focused on automotive, and we have a great deal of confidence that we will be able to make all of the steels that are used in automotive at some point.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So not a timeline...","Daniel R. DiMicco","Excuse me, Timna. I think on one previous call, John talked about a product that we made for Nissan, was it, and satisfied the most demanding hood quality requirements for exposed hoods.","John J. Ferriola","Yes, we are -- I will say this, Timna. We have done trials in -- with many different new domestic and domestic auto producers on a wide range of automotive steel, okay. And what Dan is referring to is a particular application which is, without a doubt, the most difficult application in terms of surface quality. And we did extremely well in that trial.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So at some point in the next couple of years, when we list who's suppliers to the main auto companies, we'll expect to see Nucor up there on the top?","John J. Ferriola","I would be disappointed if it was measured in years.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Months? Okay, got it. All right. So then my other question is for Jim. I think I'm understanding the LIFO. But just with the extent of the swing this last couple of quarters, can you help us understand the assumptions behind the change to credit from earlier this year?","James D. Frias","Yes, if you think about what's happened during the year, in the first quarter, we were experiencing a somewhat inflationary look forward, and so we were recording LIFO expenses, expecting the cost of scrap to be higher by the end of the year. That moderated in the second quarter so we reversed our accrual and went to a neutral position. And now in the third quarter, it's clear that scrap prices are going to be lower than they started the year at. And overall raw materials costs -- because scrap is not the only thing that goes in the LIFO calculation. It just tends to be the biggest driver. So having said that, we recorded 3 quarters of what we expect to book for the year at the end of September. And so you'll see a smaller charge or credit in the fourth quarter if things stay the way we foresee them. So we booked, I think, $84 million this quarter. We'll book 1\/3 of that in the fourth quarter, if things stay the way we see them right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from Longbow Research.","Arun S. Viswanathan - Longbow Research LLC","Just had a couple of quick questions. So I guess can you just tell me what you guys are you seeing in scrap right now? There's been, I guess, speculation that things appear to be bottoming. What are you seeing on both domestic and export side for scrap?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Before I turn it over to Mr. Ferriola, the only comment I would make about the term bottoming is, it seems like we had several bottoms throughout a 12-month period in the course of the year, and you seem to hear talk about another \"bottom.\" At the end of the day, the demand in the marketplace will establish where scrap goes and right now, demand is still pretty weak. But John, you had  some...","John J. Ferriola","The only thing that I would add to that, Dan, I think you said it really well. Predicting where scrap is going is always somewhat of a challenge. But there has always been a correlation to iron ore pricing. When you look at iron ore pricing, it's at lows over the last couple of years. Well, it did have a small period where it spiked up, I'd say spiked by a few dollars, and it's on its way back down. So it's -- I don't want to say that it's at a bottom either. I think it's going to -- I think the best way to say it is that at the end of the day, the market will determine what the price of scrap is. And it will be a function of volumes, production levels, utilization levels and what's happening in other raw materials, such as iron.","Daniel R. DiMicco","It's also impacted by what the rest of the world is doing, and there has been a general slowing. But that can change, and so it's probably more difficult to forecast today than -- and over the last couple of years than it ever has been. So we'll just leave it at that.","Arun S. Viswanathan - Longbow Research LLC","That's why we're asking you guys because you guys are right there in the thick of it, right?","Daniel R. DiMicco","We're the experts, all right.","Arun S. Viswanathan - Longbow Research LLC","All right. Just another question I guess on DRI. You expect start up in mid-'13 of the first plant. I mean, are you still planning for further capacity increases? And then I think you've discussed the economics previously on a previous call. Can you just help me try to think about how much you will save by these 2 projects?","Daniel R. DiMicco","The answer to your first question is yes. We are still on track to move the second DRI facility shortly after starting up the first, if I understood your question properly.","Arun S. Viswanathan - Longbow Research LLC","And is there a timeline for that?","Daniel R. DiMicco","When we start up, the one that we are projecting for midyear and we see that some of the different technologies, not necessarily new technologies but different ones than we were used to working with, prove to be as effective as we've been told, we will begin immediately.","James D. Frias","The second part of your question, you talked about the economics of making the DRI. We have an investor presentation that's available on our website where there's a slide that gives a side-by-side comparison of our DRI making cost at $100 iron ore costs compared to best in class in the world blast furnace with every recovery possibility that exists. And you can see that side by side. And that shows the benefit of what I view at the bottom of a market. And the real benefit -- so it's very cost-competitive with an advantage at the bottom of the market. And at peak market, we'll be a cost-based producer of iron, and iron ore may go up to, say, 180 like it did the last economic peak. Whereas pig iron went to $1,000 a ton, and that's where we will have our real savings.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Garchitorena from Credit Suisse.","Richard Garchitorena - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is in the press release, you mentioned excess domestic sheet supply is an issue impacting the market. Obviously, RG Steel is offline. Utilization rates are at 70%. So where do you think utilization need to be or is this more a function of where demand is right now?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, it's a function of overall where demand is. But you have 27 million, 28 million tons of imports coming in, it undermines even the supply, demand situation from an economic standpoint. So it's a combination of those, plus we have, as I probably stated before, plants built that never should have been built, as witnessed by the fact that now they're being basically sold off and should never have been rejuvenated for the umpteenth time and are being sold off again without any strategic players stepping forward. So whether it be new stuff that was brought in, much to the chagrin of some of the major steel player in the world, that's not worked out well. It has impacted the entire industry. And so that's the kind of situation we're in. Even in a good market, \"good market\" with the imports rate at these kind of levels, there would be a supply, demand imbalance. And -- but certainly, some of the things that are taking place at RG and elsewhere will have a moderating effect. But right now, the demand is -- and the import flows don't allow for it to show up in higher utilization rates, which need to be north of 80%.","Richard Garchitorena - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then my other question, noticed a bit of an uptick in the conversion cost this quarter. Can you give us some color as to what drives that? And is Skyline Steel part of that and then how should we think about that going forward?","Daniel R. DiMicco","The main issue that drives it is if you take a look at the utilization rates and the production numbers this quarter prior to the previous quarter, you'll see that it's throughput-related and tons-related. John, anything else?","John J. Ferriola","It's volume. Volume is the driver.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I thought I'd ask you a question on OCTG since you're a pretty big supplier of feedstock there. We've been hearing a lot about an inventory overhang as some people may have overbought, assuming the rig count would just continuously go up through the course of the year, and it flattened out. I just wanted to get your thoughts on where you see that market headed, what are we in for as far as destocking, when you think that could stabilize.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Well, I appreciate the fact that you highlighted that some people overbought. I think the bigger problem with the OCTG supply side has been the amount of tons have been shoved into this market from overseas again when the market wasn't there for it.  It wasn't a question of people having greater expectations as much as it was stuff being dumped into our market, which will be addressed shortly. John, you want to add to that?","John J. Ferriola","No, that's it. There is certainly a concern about the overall inventories. It is a result of the imports and all the buying of those imports.","Daniel R. DiMicco","And the docks that are under siege these days and sagging from the weight of imports sitting on top of them that have not been sold.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got you. And I mean, I guess, at the risk of kind of beating a dead horse. On some of these trade case, it seems like the real issue here is not that -- it's pretty obvious that there's dumping going on, but we have to prove damages as well. And I mean how do you think about it? It seems like OCTG might be a right product as far as the case goes. We've been hearing more and more about that in the news flow. But what do we need to see on the damages front before some of these things can actually start going forward?","Daniel R. DiMicco","Damages are occurring. It's a matter of a timing issue, and there's time that needs to -- you need to have passed by where those damages are and the case is put together. And those are -- will roll along the way as an industry on a number of those fronts right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Galison with CIBC World Markets.","David Galison - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to touch on the automotive again. We've talked in the past about efforts to increase automotive market share. We've seen some good success in this area. I was just wondering do you have a target level that you're looking for that you're working towards for the automotive market.","John J. Ferriola","Do we have a target level for the automotive market? Well, 100% would be nice, okay?","David Galison - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","I mean, as a percentage of Nucor's business.","John J. Ferriola","As a percentage of Nucor's business? Somewhere in the neighborhood of 15% to 20% would be a good number for us.","David Galison - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just if you could touch on your operating rates in the quarter. It looked like there was a possibility to get a bit of an uptick in Q3 with some of the downtime expected. But operating rates actually sort of trailed the industry. Just wondering if you could provide some color there.","John J. Ferriola","Well, actually if you look at our operating rate as it was recorded, it's 71%. When you look at the industry numbers, the most recent AISI number was just over 71%, 71.2%, something in that neighborhood. And what you have to look at there, David, is there's a little bit of a trailing effect on the industry-recorded numbers because of the way that they are calculated. So we feel confident when you look at the history, be it today's numbers, for example, we're right in the ballpark with the AISI numbers as we were last year. The last year the full year the AISI number was about 74.4%, we were just at 74% even. So we feel comfortable that we're right there with them.","Daniel R. DiMicco","The problem with comparing any individual company's latest information with the number reported by AISI is it's complicated even for us to figure out, but it has to do with what John said, and that is that the reporting is not from the current time period in some of the numbers that are reported as current. It may sound strange to you, but that's the way it is because it's a reporting line and what have you. It's the best estimate the industry can give at the time, but it won't be as current as what any individual company can give you.","John J. Ferriola","And that's why the best way to take a look at it is to look at it over a period, and so you're not looking at any one particular week of numbers. It doesn't give you an active picture.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Feel free to call AISI up and ask them their methodology.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Over the last 30 years or so, we've seen many foreign steel companies coming in and buying assets or building assets in North America with just tremendous failures. The specific one being the most recent and even as we speak, there's an article out on The Financial Times saying Mittal is looking to sell part of their iron ore up in Canada now. Do you think this is just the tip of the iceberg? Do you think you're going to see more opportunities, more distressed opportunities in some of these assets? I think back in 2003, you picked up, I think, it was Tuscaloosa pretty cheap. You think there's more coming?","Daniel R. DiMicco","That's a tough call. Certainly, if things don't improve from where they're at, there'll be more opportunities, i.e. failures in the marketplace. And as you well know, sometimes these things take a couple of reiterations of failure to go away. But specifically, I couldn't give you a really good feel for what the odds are of that happening. You'd have to tell me where the economy is going to be in 6 to 9 months. Principally to the flat rolled side, that's probably the most impacted by the things that you're talking about in the marketplace with new mills being built and new players coming in from overseas. Even though these companies haven't gone out of business yet, they're not making a whole lot of money on new plants they've built.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. You've mentioned there's a bit [ph] of this down in Alabama. What exactly do you see in that property?","Daniel R. DiMicco","I think, at this point in time, all of the people that have been mentioned, if they are indeed looking, including us, are doing it because it's nonbinding, whatever they're [indiscernible] ...","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's a free look.","Daniel R. DiMicco","At this point in time and at the very least, people would want to know, \"Okay, what am I going to be up against in the future because this is a new asset?\" It didn't need to be built. Despite all the rhetoric, it's never been built, and it's not going to go away. It will end up in somebody's hands. So if you can get a free look-see of what's in there, people are taking a free look-see. But it will get sold, don't get me wrong. It's not worth anywhere near what they spent on it and -- but at the end of the day, the market will determine what it gets sold for and who ends up with it. But the main attraction to it is it's new, it's there, and it's not going to be cut up by anybody.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. For you, would the most interesting parts be just the cold rolled and galvanized?","Daniel R. DiMicco","No, our interest would encompass the entire thing. I don't mean the Brazilian assets. We're talking specifically about the U.S. assets.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So you'd have to work a traditional castor into that if you're going to do it?","Daniel R. DiMicco","I don't want to give anything exactly what our plans would be if we actually ended up bidding and binding rounds and what have you. There are a couple of alternatives for how you deal with the factors, there's no melt shop there, including building one at some point in time.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. So basically you're saying that it's just a free look right now?","Daniel R. DiMicco","I think everybody is safe, they're taking a look at it, in that respect. Everybody that's looking at it is taking a look at it to see what they can make out of it. When it gets to the point where it's binding, that's when the rubber meets the road on people's interest.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aldo Mazzaferro with Macquarie.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","I just had a couple of housekeeping questions and then one other one. The housekeeping ones are just if you could update us on how many people you picked up when you bought Skyline, and what the total employees are now. And secondly, if you had any startup costs in the quarter and what they may have been.","Daniel R. DiMicco","The Skyline teammates  that came on board are a lean, mean 350 in total.","John J. Ferriola","Dan, it's a little higher than that.","Daniel R. DiMicco","It's a little higher than that?","John J. Ferriola","It's about 490, and pre-operating startup cost, the trend, Aldo, was back...","Daniel R. DiMicco","There are people looking at me cross-eyed here. It's somewhere between 350 and 490, Aldo. We'll get our s*** together.","James D. Frias","And in the second quarter, our pre-operating startup costs were $19 million. They actually slipped a little bit in the third quarter to $16 million, and we're expecting next quarter to be around $19 million again.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","All right, great. And then Dan, this is not an import-related question. It's a question of a little bit on politics. If you were to go forward with the request for import protection and cases like that, which political party you think gives you better support in that? It's a little confusing to me.","Daniel R. DiMicco","First off, we're not going forward on import protection. We're going forward on enforcement of the laws that these trading -- so-called trading partners agreed to have access to global markets, including the markets here in the U.S., both WTO-related and U.S. trade law-related and favored nation trading status-related and so on and so on. So we're not looking for protection. We're looking for enforcement of the laws to stop cheaters from cheating. That's number one. Number two, as far as the political parties go, I'm not going to get into commenting about that. I certainly like the strong tough language that Romney is putting out on China and stopping the cheaters. As you well know, our position on China is well known, well documented and no running from that, no desire to run from that. We've had good success with support on trade cases in Washington in the Democratic resilience [ph] too although we've been disappointed there hasn't been stronger action on China, which is the #1 trade issue facing this country not just the steel industry. So at the end of the day, it's who walks the talk as opposed to who just says the words.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Parr from KeyBanc.","Mark L. Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. The one area that I was curious, if you could maybe give some color on would be every month you have to make a determination on scrap buy and those [ph] that would potentially be in a position to see how other mills would buy it. I mean we've seen such a downdraft in scrap, particularly in October. Just wondering if you characterize the buying activity as about in line with what you would normally do or maybe it's a little heavier than usual. Any color that you've got will be appreciated.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Our buying opportunity or the industry's buying?","Mark L. Parr - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just whatever you -- either way would be great. I mean, if you think the industry bought heavy in October because the price came down so much, that would be interesting.","Daniel R. DiMicco","I know it would be, but I wouldn't comment on either one. No offense, but that's not something we should comment on. I think you just take a look at the pricing, and it tells you what's going on. If prices are dropping $40 to $50 a ton one month, going up $40 to $50 a ton another month, that pretty much gives you an idea how the industry is behaving, particularly if you understand what's going on with the Turks and others in terms of exporting scrap out of our market. So I don't really want to comment about exactly what we saw taking place and not taking place. But I understand your question. It's a good question.","Operator","Our next question is from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just had a question for Jim. CapEx this year, about $1 billion. What are we looking at for next year preliminarily?","James D. Frias","We haven't put our budget together yet.  We'll have those budget meetings in November to set that, but we expect it to be lower with the windup of the DRI facility.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And any help you could give us on startup costs? I know you don't like to break those out necessarily anymore.","James D. Frias","I think the next quarter -- I just talked about next quarter, that's about as far out as we have a good view at. We think might be in the neighborhood of $19 million next quarter, with $16 million this quarter. We'll start ramping up obviously, next year as the DRI facility gets to full employment prior to them actually up -- being up and running. So we'll start ticking up probably, and the second quarter will be the heaviest quarter, I would think.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Second quarter will be the heaviest on startup costs?","James D. Frias","Yes, and we'll probably start disclosing it in our earnings release itself when it becomes a material number. Not probably, we will.","Philip Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So we should expect basically a ramp from this rate of startup into startup peaking in the second quarter next year?","James D. Frias","Yes, sir. It will probably be at a similar level in the third quarter and then it will fall off.","Operator","And our final question comes from Michelle Applebaum with Steel Market Intelligence.","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","Just a follow-up question, and hopefully, it's just a housekeeping question. When you say that you expect earnings to be down exclusive of onetime items, that's down from $0.45, is what you're assuming as the clean number?","James D. Frias","Michelle, we specifically don't give quantitative guidance. We're giving qualitative guidance. And you do a good job with math. We've talked about what LIFO was. It was $0.84 -- $84 million, $0.16. It will be about 1\/3 of that next quarter, so you can make that adjustment. You know the onetime startup costs are going to be not recurring. There may be other ones, but we don't know what those are or what those might be right now. And then finally, we are saying that steel mill profits will be lower. So you can do the math from there. We're not saying a specific number.","Daniel R. DiMicco","We're not saying a specific number, but there is a...","Michelle Applebaum - Steel Market Intelligence Inc","I'm asking about the LIFO, the $0.11.","James D. Frias","Yes. Well, I answered the question on LIFO for an earlier caller. We said $0.16 year-to-date. It was booked all in the third quarter. We're expecting to be in the neighborhood of $0.05 in the fourth quarter. It could change depending on what happens to scrap prices this quarter, but that's our current expectation.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to our speakers for any closing comments.","Daniel R. DiMicco","Thank you, Camille. And once again, we'd just like to thank all our teammates, our shareholders and our customers for your support, our suppliers and also, thank everybody listening for their interest in Nucor.

As a reminder today's call is being recorded. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will come at that time.","Certain statements made during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. The words we expect, believe, anticipate and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify those forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and information that is currently available.

Please go ahead sir.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call and for your interest in Nucor. Other members of Nucor's executive team are also on the call today including Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer, Joe Stratman, our Chief Digital Officer, Craig Feldman responsible for Raw Materials, Ladd Hall responsible for Sheet and Tubular Products, Ray Napolitan responsible for Engineered Bar Products, Dave Sumoski, responsible for Merchant Bar and Rebar Products, Leon Topalian, responsible for Beam and Plate Products, and Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated Construction Products.","Before we review our 2018 financial results. Let me make a few comments about safety. Safety continues to be job number one for every Nucor teammate. Nucor safety incident rates are consistently below the national averages for comparable operations almost always less than half of the nationwide figure, but we're not satisfied with that. Our goal is zero incidents in all Nucor facilities. Our teammates remind each other regularly that they must work safely so that each of us returns home to our families at the end of every shift.","So let me just take a moment to repeat what I say every time I visit a Nucor facility. Nothing is more important than safety. Absolutely nothing.","I want to thank all of our teammates for working safely and identifying and mitigating the risks in your operations. I appreciate your continued focus on driving our incident rates towards our ultimate goal which always must be zero.","Now I'll review some highlights from the year, then Jim Frias will discuss our financial performance for the fourth quarter and for the year.","The best way for me to sum up 2018 is this. It was a record year for Nucor. We posted record earnings per share and we shipped a record amount of steel. Strong economic growth fueled our record year, tax reform and the ongoing efforts to reform the Federal Regulatory System took a good economy at the end of 2017 and made it even better. The Section 232 steel tariffs provided another tailwind for Nucor. Between the tariffs and the cumulative impact of the trade cases the industry has won in recent years unfairly traded imports to the U.S. market have declined significantly. Increased demand levels and lower inputs generated approximately 6 million tons of added volume for the U.S. steel industry last year. Over the past decade, we have been positioning Nucor to take full advantage of an upturn in the steel market. During that time we invested more than $9 billion to increase the company's peak earnings power. These investments enhanced our competitive strengths by building on our product diversity and market leadership positions.","Our financial results demonstrate that Nucor is disciplined strategy of investing for profitable growth is working. Here are just a few examples of how those investments are growing our company's earnings power and driving shareholder value creation. Our sheet metal group's 2018 pre-tax contribution was more than 80% greater than the group's prior record performance achieved during the previous steel industry's up cycle.","During the economic downturn, our sheet metal investments included the acquisition of Gallatin steel, Decatur's galvanizing line, Berkeley's caster and Hot Mill upgrade and Hickman's vacuum degasser.","Our engineered bar products group also delivered record earnings last year driven by strategic investments that expanded value-added product capabilities at our mills in Nebraska, Tennessee and South Carolina.","The plate mill group realized attractively terms because of the investments we made to add heat treating and normalizing capabilities at our Nucor steel Harford. And to add accelerated cooling capabilities at Tuscaloosa.","The structural steel mill group is capitalizing on Nucor [new] [ph] models expanded product portfolio that now includes high strength, low alloy beams and wider lighter sheet pilings. Shipments of high strength low alloy beams more than doubled in 2018 from the prior year level. This has been achieved after making our first shipments in late 2016 into this product market previously served exclusively by imports.","Our Downstream steel product segment delivered record earnings in 2018, powered by the impressive performance of the HSS and electrical conduit product acquisitions, we completed in late 2016 and early 2017. Finally, significant earnings gains were achieved by our David J. Joseph scrap business and both of our DRI plants. The Louisiana DRI facility established new annual records for plant uptime, production and shipments in 2018. David J. Joseph's profitability was just shy of its record performance achieved during 2008 unprecedented raw materials market, successful execution of DJJ's mill alignment and efficiency initiatives is enhancing the returns delivered by both our scrap recycling and steelmaking businesses.","We continue to invest in Nucor's future in order to build our Nucor's long track record of delivering superior returns for investors. Over the course of 2018, we announced approximately $1 billion of value enhancing investments to build new mills, expand production capacity at existing mills and advanced Nucor's technological capabilities.","In 2019, we have already announced another $1.3 billion investment to build a modern state-of-the-art plate mill in the U.S. Midwest, which I'll discuss in greater detail shortly.","In the coming year, we expect to complete many of these high return initiatives which will grow our steelmaking capabilities in both long and flat products. Six projects will begin operations this year that represent approximately $1 billion in capital investment and will create approximately 700 new full time jobs at Nucor. We are excited to begin realizing the benefits of these value enhancing investments.","Many of you joined us earlier this month for the announcement of our newest growth initiative a state-of-the-art plate mill to be located in the Midwest. The mill will have an annual capacity of 1.2 million tons and it's expected to be operational in 2022. This investment will position us right in the heart of America's largest plate consuming region, which will give us logistical advantages over our competitors. It is also a region with excellent scrap availability. A new mill will allow us to produce 97% of the plate products demanded in the domestic market including the highest margin products enabling us to build a clear market leadership position in the U.S. plate market. Now these investments, Nucor will be well-positioned to capitalize on regional market opportunities and drive continued profitable growth. We will post a status update on our major investment initiatives on the Investor Relations page of our Web Site later today.","As we begin 2019, we are encouraged about the outlook for our domestic end-use market. In fact, we see improving market conditions in 20 of the 24 end-use markets we participate in today. Three of the remaining four are stable and one is declining as we head into 2019. 2019 is expected to be another solid year for automotive sales and Nucor plans to continue growing our share of this important market.","In construction, we expect low single-digit growth this year and we have a strong presence in this market from highways to HVAC. Despite recent volatility in the energy market, market demand for line pipe will continue to grow as longer mileage projects get underway. We look forward to expanding our Gallatin Mill in order to produce the API grades required by this market. And in the heavy equipment and agricultural markets, we continue to experience healthy demand and high replacement needs.","2018 was an extra ordinary year and while we are proud of Nucor's continued success, we remain focused on taking care of our customers, executing our growth strategy and delivering even higher returns on our invested capital.","Jim Frias will now provide more specific detail about our fourth quarter performance and financial position. Jim?","Jim Frias","Thanks John.","Nucor reported fourth quarter 2018 earnings of $2.07 per diluted share and full year 2018 record earnings of $7.42 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results exceeded the top-end of our guidance range by about $0.12 per diluted share due to stronger than expected performance by our sheet structural and raw materials businesses. 2018 record annual earnings represent an increase of 24% compared to our previous earnings record of $5.98 per diluted share reported in 2008.","Our strategy for profitable growth is working. Nucor continues to benefit from our longstanding tradition of investing opportunistically through economic cycles to grow long-term earnings power.","Nucor also generated exceptionally strong cash flow over the course of 2018. For the year, cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $2.4 billion as compared with 2017's operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion. These results combined with our disciplined approach to capital allocation enable us to return more than $1.3 billion to shareholders via dividends of $485 million and share repurchases of $854 million. After repurchasing 13.7 million shares last year, Nucor ended 2018 of approximately 306 million shares outstanding, $1.5 billion remains available under Nucor's existing share repurchase authorization.","In addition, in December, Nucor's Board increased our regular quarterly cash dividend by more than 5% to $0.40 per share. Our company has increased its base dividend for 46 consecutive years every year since we first began paying dividends in 1973. Nucor's long-term success in rewarding our shareholders has been and will continue to be driven by effective and balanced capital allocation.","Our ongoing investments to deliver future profitable growth are the vital foundation to that work. For 2019, we estimate capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 billion. That represents a significant increase from 2018 capital spending of approximately $1 billion approximately 70% of planned 2019 capital expenditures are for expansion, product improvement and cost savings projects with the remaining 30% for replacement or maintenance purposes.","As John has already noted, Nucor has announced 10 significant growth projects that represent total capital investment of approximately $3.5 billion that will begin operations between 2019 and 2022. Of these capital outlays, approximately $600 million has been spent through 2018 an estimated $900 million will be spent in 2019 and the remaining investments of about $2 billion will occur through the end of 2022.","We are excited about the impact that these investments will have for Nucor and all its stakeholders. We are directing our capital very strategically towards clear market opportunities and expect these projects to provide incremental EBITDA exceeding $600 million during normal market conditions. Nucor is already amongst the most diversified steel producers in the world with leadership positions in numerous products, regions and end use markets. These investments will enhance those leadership positions and position Nucor to outperform the industry for many years to come. We intend to fund these investments with internally generated cash flow and plan to continue returning a minimum of 40% of our earnings to our shareholders while maintaining our strong financial condition.","With respect to our balance sheet at year-end, our total debt outstanding was $4.3 billion and our gross debt to capital ratio was 30%. Our year-end cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.4 billion.","Now turning to our outlook. John has already mentioned the positive trends we are observing in our major end use markets. We do think that 2019 will be another strong year with earnings performance among the best in Nucor's history. For the first quarter of 2019, although sheet pricing and margins are expected to decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect that this will be partially offset by increases in profitability at bar and structural mills.","The performance of the raw materials segment is expected to decrease in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the decreased performance of our DRI businesses. We expect the profitability of our steel products segment in the first quarter of 2019 to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2018.","Overall, we do expect that the first quarter of 2019 will be much stronger for Nucor than the first quarter of 2018.","Thank you for your interest in our company. Now I'll turn the call back over to John. John?","John Ferriola","Thanks Jim.","Before I wrap up, I want to say a few words about our newly updated corporate Web Site nucor.com. The new Web Site and branding reflect our focus on our customers. It is part of our effort to achieve commercial excellence by using our broad product portfolio and financial strength to give our customers the best possible experience. This is summed up by our new tagline 'Powerful Partnerships. Powerful Results.'","The Web Site is a great resource for anyone who wants to learn more about our company. We will continue to build upon and improve this site to meet the needs of our stakeholders. My thanks to the team that brought this new site together.","Let me conclude by thanking our more than 25000 teammates across Nucor for making 2018 a record year for our company. Your efforts not just in 2018, but as we pursued our growth strategy over the last decade enabled us to attain this milestone. I am proud that we could recognize your hard work with an extraordinary bonus last year. You certainly deserved it.","The team at Charlotte appreciates the work you do every day to build a safer and more profitable Nucor. I'd also like to say thank you to our customers. We appreciate the trust you place in Nucor and we'll continue to do our very best to earn it with every order.","We would now be happy to answer your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse.","Curt Woodworth","Hi. Good afternoon John and Jim.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon.","Curt Woodworth","Two questions not relating to the flat-rolled market which tends to get all the press. But firstly, when you look at your long products portfolio, you seemed pretty significant change in metal spread across most of all your line product categories as well as plate. So I just did some quick numbers looking at 1Q'18 versus 4Q'18 and it's at $1.6 billion of incremental EBITDA run rate just on metal spread change. So first question is, do you think that fundamentals for these products in terms of consolidation in the bar market tariffs is everything you're seeing on the demand side would that suggest you think margins would stay elevated relative to where you were this year?","And then, second question, certainly just on the downstream businesses obviously HSS had a very good performance this year. Do you think that hollow structural pricing can stay relatively solid even though we've seen clearly a big step down in HRC and just talk to how we should model that business? Thank you.","John Ferriola","Let me start by addressing the first question. Clearly, as we mentioned in the script, we've seen demand staying strong in our downstream businesses in the downstream markets that includes our long products. So we see a lot of good year for that. I'm not going to comment on what's happening with any of our competitors. I'll just refer to the demand and say the demand looks good going forward. We continue to work with some projects that will actually help us in 2019 lower our cost structure and some of the capital products that we're bringing online. We're excited about that. So with demand strong and us bringing on some capacity what we think will be very competitive in the marketplace. We think it's going to be a strong year for our long products and it looks really good going into the year also, I don't see anything changing there slipping just a little bit as we start the year with the end demand remain strong. So I think it's going to be a good year for that also.","Now to address your question on HSS, now that has been just an outstanding business for us both the HSS and the conduit business. Certainly, we'll see pricing dip a little bit with [HR] [ph] high demand dipping a little bit but the margin should stay pretty constant. And so we think demand is certainly good. And as you might have heard, we just announced a price increase of $40 on HR and on our flat-rolled products and also on the HSS. So, we see our market picking up in terms of pricing.","Curt Woodworth","Have you seen customer every time extended on those price hike announcements. You think that's enough to get consumers out of the destock mindset?","John Ferriola","Well, I can't comment it's really too early to comment on what's happening there. I know our lead times on high demand today are about three to four weeks and cold-rolled and galv was about five to six weeks someone in that neighborhood. But it's too early to see any change in that based up on the price increases was just on yesterday.","Curt Woodworth","Fair. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Korn","Hey good afternoon everyone. Congratulations on a great year.","John Ferriola","Thank you.","Matthew Korn","Want to ask on the scrap markets, it seems as though the market was fairly shocked at the gap down in price that we saw in early January and watching the recent reports, it seems that the export markets have come off their bottom. Turkish mills are buying again, that's in your view, you think this is meaningful yet for the domestic market, should be getting a little bit more constructive as we think about February and afterwards?","John Ferriola","Well, it's certainly going into -- we think it's hit the bottom we think that it's going to strengthen going forward. You mentioned several other reasons why I would also add to that known seasonal issue as we go into the winter months. Right now the flows are still very strong there's no issue with flows, but it was -- we are about to hit a terrible cold snap in the Midwest that could impact that. So I would say certainly no more down movement. We don't think. We think it's going to be pretty stable to moving up slowly.","Matthew Korn","And then, ex-scrap costs, how should we think about the total drag from any other higher year-over-year raw materials into '19, electro, natural gas other metallics. Assuming that there's a little bit less DRI availability from Louisiana this year versus last year. Overall, what would you say you're budgeting for '19 on all the raw material sides in that front versus '18, if you could give any color?","John Ferriola","Jim, do you have any details on what we have budgeted?","Jim Frias","Not specifically but I would say that we would not expect material inflation in those areas.","John Ferriola","Most of the electrode increases that we saw last year were based into last year's numbers and frankly we see that's starting to soften a bit. So we expect them to be no higher and probably a little bit softer as we go into 2019. Alloys, we think will be flat going forward. So in terms of raw material cost, what I've known out there is still the iron ore with the situation that just occurred in Brazil. We don't know what impact that will have on us. It's too early to tell.","Matthew Korn","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we'll get to Seth Rosenfeld with Jefferies.","Seth Rosenfeld","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Two follow ups on the downstream products division please. Can you comment on the outlook for order backlog in that division and how that's developed over the last year comparing this to January 2018 would you see a stronger, a weaker backlog at this stage? And secondly, can you comment on fabrication margin obviously rebar fab has been under pressure for some time. What are your expectations for those margins going through 2019? Thank you.","John Ferriola","Jim, why don't you kick it off?","Jim Frias","Yes. I will address the first part of the question on demand for our downstream year-over-year. And I would say overall the demand for our downstream business is as strong as we enter 2019. Most of our downstream businesses have improved backlogs year-over-year. I might mention that last year we were in a margin squeeze as steel prices went up and we're proud of the teams they were able to navigate that. And we're looking forward to 2019 as we expect some expansion in margins with steel prices having come down slightly.","In regards to your second part of the question which was rebar fab. That is one of the still challenging markets that we have. That's no secret. That market has been challenged especially in the U.S. for the last 12 to 18 months. Demand is solid. Imports have declined and rebar steel costs have risen. However, the marketplace fabrication pricing has not yet fully reacted to that. We are encouraged, however, recently by the pricing dynamics that we're starting to see. We do have a backlog, however, we have to work through, but we do expect improved performance as we enter the second half of the year in rebar fabrication.","Seth Rosenfeld","Thank you. And just to clarify, given the tenure of that backlog, would you expect rebar fab on a standalone basis to see a meaningful improvement in margin by second half or take longer entirety that order book to turn more positive.","Jim Frias","I think we'll see in the second half of the year, yes, more improved margin especially in the U.S. Our Canadian fabrication business which is a significant part of our business is very strong, very strong backlogs with better margins. But in the U.S. we'll work through those over the next six to eight months. But with current pricing dynamics that we see currently we are encouraged for the second half of the year.","Seth Rosenfeld","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we'll go to Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners","Hey good afternoon guys. How are you?","John Ferriola","Good afternoon.","Timna Tanners","First, I thought I'd start out asking if we could make some comments about some of the new capacity in the marketplace recently. So specifically the JSW Mill and the restart in Granite City, are you seeing them, are you running up against them, is that part of the market weakness? And what do you think the market will look like in a couple of years. You see all this new capacity being as daunting as some fear or do you think that we'll have a shakeout?","John Ferriola","Well, I think there's always a shakeout if there's a stocking in demand. Let me address the first question. When you look at what's come online today particularly in the sheet markets exclusively in the sheet market, you are looking at about 2.5 million tons of new capacity coming online. Imports are down about 1 million tons. So you have a net of about 1.5 million tons in a market that's 60 million tons overall, the whole sheet market. So it's not that great of a change.","At the end of the day, the most cost competitive most efficient, best operating company will be the one that does the best, [think of others] [ph] if what happens with capacity coming online. And we think we do pretty well in all of those areas. So there will be some shakeout probably. Are we seeing a major impact today? Some. I don't believe that the current pricing situation that you see today as a result of that additional capacity. I believe that some of it is a result of the service that have filled up that took place at the end of last year. And there's going to be a period of time when they're looking to unload some of those tons. When you look at the months on hand for sheet products you can kind of see where we -- what happened over the months between October and December. So there's some of that going forward.","But the key thing here is demand continues to be strong and we think that demand will continue to grow. Our best estimate today on sheet is probably about 1.5% to 2% growth over the course of this year. So between the demand growth as we work our way out of this inventory situation that's short lived. I think you're going to see things return to a more normalized state. We announced the price increase the other day and we would not do it if we weren't confident that we'd be able to collect on it.","Timna Tanners","Okay. Super. That's helpful. And then, just because the buyback in Q4 was particularly high and you have that high quality problem of generating a lot of cash even and when I plug in there's some new CapEx guidance. Should we consider this being a good run rate given what you know of your current project profile or are there other factors that we could consider when contemplating what your buyback program might look like?","John Ferriola","Jim, you want to tackle that?","Jim Frias","Yes. I'll take it. We will return 40% of profits as a minimum to investors. And then with the Board of Directors, we'll look at our net debt to capital position through the year and if we think we have extra liquidity that should be returned to investors we will. And we will choose between additional dividends or share purchases based on what our intrinsic value model says about the stock price at that time.","The other thing I'd add is, we did raise the dividend issue by 5% and we were able to do that because we reduced the share count by 4%. And so year-over-year, our dividend outlays will be about the same in 2019 compared to '18 even though the dividend per share is higher than 5% percent. Is that helpful?","Timna Tanners","Yes, it is. I mean I guess I would just say is there anything in particular that helped drive that Q4 size of the buyback. I think I understand you saying it was also an analysis of where you think the share price should be and where it is? Is that a factor then as well?","Jim Frias","Yes, it is. But I think the bigger factor was just that we recognize we're going to proceed with such strong good liquidity and so we felt like it was the appropriate thing to do.","Timna Tanners","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Phil Gibbs","Hey, good afternoon.","John Ferriola","Good afternoon.","Phil Gibbs","Hey, John. During your mid-quarter you stated in the release that you thought your cash balance would be flat quarter-over-quarter and this morning it showed it was down over $500 million and I guess we were surprised by that to say the least. Any thoughts on that?","John Ferriola","Well, in general it was a result of an inventory build that we weren't anticipating. Jim you want to get into any more detail?","Jim Frias","Phil, I would just say that we weren't expecting the trade to go up the way it did. And we think it's something needs to come back down early in 2019. So we'll work on that. But that's the reason we didn't hit the cash numbers we were expecting.","Phil Gibbs","Do you think that was more related to the -- some of the contract or service center customers not taking as much volume as you thought late in the year pushing that out?","Jim Frias","There were a number of factors that was one of the factors. There's also quite a lot of lead time or some of the things that we used to make steel and that plays a factor to the forecast of what we're going to be operating at had to be made months and months in advance of our actually receiving the materials.","Phil Gibbs","Okay. And then secondly costs within the steel business looked a little bit elevated to our model. Just curious if there were any maintenance outages in the number or was there some catch up that got played through into the numbers from earlier in the year on some of those inflationary items?","John Ferriola","No. There wasn't anything extraordinary in the way of maintenance. As far as the end of the year when we had some available time we took the opportunity some extra maintenance but there was nothing extraordinary that we can report to you.","Phil Gibbs","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Next we'll go to Derek Hernandez with Seaport Global Securities.","Derek Hernandez","Hi, good afternoon. I was just hoping if you could elaborate your view on the positive end use demand and general economic conditions as well as the three segments that you said were not as positive as previously.","John Ferriola","Well, what I said was that we saw out of the 24 markets that we followed 23 of them are steady or increasing the one that we see declining slightly as we go into 2019 is power generation.","Derek Hernandez","I see. Thank you very much.","Operator","That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to John Ferriola for any additional comments or closing remarks.","John Ferriola","Thank you, David. Well, let me sign-off by saying thank you to our shareholders. We appreciate your ongoing confidence and your support. Thank you to our customers. We appreciate the opportunity to earn your business every day. We believe that together we can build powerful partnerships and powerful results. And finally to my Nucor teammates, thank you for a great year and your ongoing commitment to take care of our customers. And as always most importantly thank you for doing it safely. Thanks for your interest in Nucor. Have a great day.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation you may now disconnect."]}}
