Susan?","Susan Karlix","John Deere announced its third quarter earnings today. And in our view, it was a solid performance in light of the weak conditions in the global agricultural sector. Deere\u2019s results reflected the sound execution of our operating plans and the success of efforts to manage costs.","Although results were lower than in the same quarter a year ago, all of our businesses remained solidly profitable. As a result the company continues to be well positioned to meet the needs of customers while funding its growth plans and returning cash to stockholders.","Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at the third quarter in detail beginning on slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 20% to $7.594 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $512 million. EPS was $1.53 in the quarter.","On slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 22% to $6.8 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by two points. Currency translation was negative by six points.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let\u2019s start with Agriculture & Turf on slide 5. Net sales were down 24% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in all regions of the world, but the decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes of large Ag equipment in the United States and Canada. Also hurting sales was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange.","Operating profit was $472 million. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by lower shipment volume, a less favorable product mix and foreign exchange partially offset by price realization and lower production cost. The division\u2019s decremental margin the quarter was 28%, quite respectable considering the decrease in large Ag sales.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let\u2019s look at fundamentals affecting the Ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts, our 2014 forecast calls for cash receipts of about $418 billion, up about 1% from 2013, and the highest level ever recorded.","Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and consequently the lower commodity prices we\u2019re seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 7%.","Looking ahead to next year, based on our expectation of - above trend-line yields for 2015 and declining livestock prices, our very early forecast calls for total cash receipts to be down slightly in 2016.","On slide 7, global grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels, even after the abundant harvests of the past two years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong, while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tensions could disrupt trade, lower production, reduce stocks-to-use ratio, and result in prices quickly moving higher.","Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on slide 8. Gradual economic growth continues in the region. While grain prices appear to be stabilizing at levels near the long-term average, the dairy sector remains under pressure. As a result, farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be lower for the year. I should mention, we are encouraged by some early indications that this market maybe in the early stages of recovery.","On slide 9, you\u2019ll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In China, the government\u2019s continued investment in equipment subsidies and mechanizations are supportive of agriculture. However, the economic slowdown and lower commodity prices have led to a decrease in forecast industry sales.","Turning to India, positive consumer and investors sentiment are encouraging economic growth. While the government continues to support agriculture, two consecutive below normal monsoon seasons are hurting the farm sector. In the CIS, continued deterioration of economic growth and further tightening of credit continue to weigh on equipment sales. Notably, western equipment manufacturers are being heavily affected by the weak Russian currency and geopolitical uncertainties.","Shifting to Brazil, slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness. Ag production is expected to decrease about 11% for the year in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices.","However, with the weak real, the value of production is much more attractive in the local currency, up about 10% that\u2019s because Brazilian farmers sell their crops in dollars. Even with the recent drop in prices, Ag fundamentals remain positive for grains. Our early forecast calls for the value of production to be down slightly in 2016.","Slide 11 illustrates eligible finance rates for Ag equipment in Brazil. The 2015\/2016 Ag budget affirmed eligible finance rates for Ag equipment are 7.5% and 9%, through the end of June 2016 depending on a farmer\u2019s revenues, with no change on the required down payment.","So, rates have increased, they are not considerably higher than they were in 2011 which was a banner year for industry sales in Brazil. And they remain below current market rates of about 14%. Nonetheless, farmer confidence is lower as a result of these rising interest rates, economic uncertainty and political concerns, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. Still, long term fundamentals for the Ag business in Brazil are solid.","Our 2015 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on slide 12. Lower commodity prices and falling farm incomes are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, especially larger models. At the same time, conditions in the livestock sector are more positive, providing support to sales of small and mid-sized tractors. We continue to expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 25% for 2015.","The EU 28 industry outlook is down about 10%, unchanged from last quarter, due to lower crop prices and farm income, as well as pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 20% to 25% in 2015, a reflection of the factors already discussed.","Shifting to Asia, we now expect sales to be down moderately with most of the decline in India and China. In the CIS, we continue to expect industry sales to be down significantly, due to limited credit availability, the weak ruble and overall economic concerns.","Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2015, no change from our prior forecast.","Putting this all together on slide 13, fiscal year 2015 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 25%, including about five points of negative currency translation. Our forecast for the Ag & Turf divisions operating margin continues to be approximately 8%.","Now let\u2019s focus on Construction & Forestry on slide 14. Net sales were down 13% in the quarter and operating profit was down 34% due to lower shipment volumes and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency. The division\u2019s decremental margin was 29%.","Moving to slide 15, looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide. GDP growth is positive, unemployment is falling, construction hiring is on the increase, and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units this year.","In spite of these encouraging economic indicators and positive dealer and customer sentiment, we are seeing weakening in our order books. Some contributing factors to the slowdown in demand are the conditions in the energy sector and energy producing regions, wet weather that slowed construction activities this spring and summer, the decline in rental utilization rates and sluggish economic growth outside the United States.","As a result, Deere\u2019s Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 5% in 2015. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about three points. Global forestry markets are now expected to be flat to up 5% on the heels of a 10% increase in 2014, as gains in the U.S. and Europe are offset by declines in other regions of the world. C&F\u2019s full year operating margin is now projected to be about 10%.","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operations. Slide 16, shows annualized provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average owned portfolio was 12 basis points at the end of July. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios.","The financial forecast for 2015 now contemplates a lot provision of about 13 basis points versus 9 basis points in 2014. The increase is a reflection of unsustainably low loss levels of the last four years. It remains well below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and the 15-year average of 43 points.","Moving to slide 17, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $153 million in the third quarter versus $162 million last year. Lower results for the quarter were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, partially offset by lower selling administrative and general expenses. The division\u2019s forecast net income attributable to Deere & Company remains at about $630 million for the year.","Slide 18 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $1.5 billion. That\u2019s equal to 30.6% of prior 12-month sales compared with 29.8% a year ago. We expect to end the year with total receivables and inventories down about $350 million. With this decrease forecast to come entirely from Ag & Turf, the division will have reduced receivables and inventories by almost $2 billion over the last two years. At constant exchange rates, the two-year decline is about $1.4 billion.","Our 2015 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales, shown on slide 19, is about 78%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2015, keep these factors in mind: price realizations of about one point; favorable raw material costs; an unfavorable mix of product and Tier 4 product costs.","With respect to R&D expense on slide 20, R&D was down 4% in the third quarter, including four points of negative currency translation. So, essentially flat on a constant exchange basis. Our 2015 forecast now calls for R&D to be down about 2% for the full year, including about three points of negative currency translation.","Moving now to slide 21, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 7% in the third quarter, including five points of currency translation. Our 2015 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 11% with landscapes, water, incentive compensation and currency accounting for about nine points of the change.","Turning to slide 22, pension and OPEB expense was up $25 million in the quarter and is forecast to be up about $70 million in 2015.","On slide 23, the equipment operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter. For the remainder of fiscal 2015, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.","Slide 24 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $3.2 billion in 2015.","The company\u2019s fourth quarter financial outlook is on slide 25. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 24% compared with 2014. This includes about one point of price realization with unfavorable currency translation of about five points.","Turning to slide 26 and the full-year outlook, the forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 21%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about one point with negative currency translation of about four points.","Finally, our forecast now calls for net income attributable to Deere & Company to be about $1.8 billion for the full year.","As a closing thought, John Deere is well on its way to another good year and doing so in the face of some pretty significant headwinds. Our performance highlights our success establishing a wider range of revenue sources and a more durable business model.","As a result, the company is showing great resilience and discipline and performing much better than in previous farm downturns. Longer term, we believe our steady investment in new products and geographies will make Deere the provider of choice for a growing global customer base.","What\u2019s more, we believe the impact of these actions will become increasingly clear as the end-markets for our products start moving ahead. These are just some of the reasons we have confidence in the company\u2019s present course and in our ability to deliver significant value to customers and investors well into the future.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Tony.","Tony Huegel","Thanks Susan. Now we\u2019re ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Our operator David will instruct you on the polling procedure. But, in considerations of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. David?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question today will be from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning.","A - Tony Huegel","Hi Jamie.","Q - Jamie Cook","Hi, I guess two questions. One, Tony, could you or Susan or Raj speak to where you guys are relative to expectation with regards to inventory in the channel, that\u2019s a big concern in the market and how that sort of impacts2016? And whether the excess inventory rolls into \u201816? And then I guess my second question is if you could just give us some color on the order book, the early order book so far? Thanks.","A - Tony Huegel","In the spirit of one question, I\u2019ll go ahead and answer your first one and then we\u2019ll pick the second one up hopefully from someone else or I\u2019ll ask you to get back in the queue, okay.","Q - Jamie Cook","Okay.","A - Tony Huegel","So, as we think about inventory, and I\u2019ll split it between new and used inventory, and I\u2019m assuming, you\u2019re primarily looking at large Ag in the U.S. and Canada?","Q - Jamie Cook","Of course.","A - Tony Huegel","Okay. As you think about new inventory and I would say similar situation to what we talked about in the past, in the sense that we continue to have new inventory well below the competitors. We tend to have 50% or less as you look at inventory as a percent of sales and that continues to be the case. We continue to evaluate that of course as we go through the year and see various changes in the market.","Used equipment continues to be a challenge. We are making good progress on used equipment. As you look at some of the factors from a large Ag perspective, we\u2019re down about 10% year-over-year in July in terms of where we\u2019re at with used inventory. Pricing is holding in okay, if you look at it kind of from a two-year average, we would be slightly below that. But believe we continue to maintain a healthy premium versus our competition.","And again, we are making progress but it\u2019s likely we would expect these efforts will continue into 2016, we continue to coordinate with our dealers to assist with the movement of the used equipment. But it is still especially on large tractors continues to be a challenge that we\u2019re working on within the market.","Q - Jamie Cook","Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Your next question will be from Steven Fisher with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Steven Fisher","Great, thanks, good morning. So, I guess, I\u2019ll pick up on the second half of Jamie\u2019s question on how early order programs are trending year-over-year and specifically if you could talk also about your approach to incentives year-over-year on the early order program?","A - Tony Huegel","One of the challenges that we do have in terms of comparison year-over-year is there are some timing differences in terms of when we have various phases of the early order programs. And the closing of the first phase is a bit different year-over-year.","Now, having said that, so, I just want to make sure I have that clearly out front but directionally what we\u2019re seeing is order activity on those early order programs are off year-over-year. And just to be clear, what we\u2019re talking about is planters sprayers and tillage. A lot of people will have questions around combine early order programs I\u2019m guessing, but remember those just started up in early August. And candidly it\u2019s just too early to make any type of conclusions related to where that program is.","One of the challenges we do have also as you think about the spring seasonal early order programs, and where we would think that perhaps in this current environment where they may not be as close of a correlation to overall, or as good of an indicator of overall demand going into next year, is the fact that they do have a much higher level of stock component versus retail orders in those spring seasonal order programs.","And again, given the dynamics in the market, there is candidly not as much pressure to put orders in at this particular point. And we really believe the combine early order program, as that continues to develop, will be a better indicator of actual demand. And again, I want to be clear, I\u2019m not trying to skirt the issue, certainly we are seeing in those early order programs, orders being off year-over-year which historically would indicate some additional weakening as you move into 2016.","Q - Steven Fisher","Can you say what degree of magnitude they\u2019re off year-over-year?","A - Tony Huegel","Similar to last year we aren\u2019t going to discuss the magnitude again, because and some of that goes back to the timing of the ending of the early order program. And it could give some misleading numbers both, more positive or more negative depending on the program in terms of when they actually close. So, but again, it is directionally down year-over-year. So we will go to the next.","Q - Steven Fisher","Thanks a lot.","A - Tony Huegel","Okay, thank you. Next question.","Operator","Next question is from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Adam Uhlman","Hi guys, good morning.","A - Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Q - Adam Uhlman","Could you talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing in Europe, you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing some early stage of recovery in that market, maybe talk to your orders on a year-over-year basis for the quarter, do you expect to hit positive sales anytime soon? What are you looking for to confirm that early stage of recovery? Thanks.","A - Tony Huegel","Sure. I think some of that, as you look at the general economy, we\u2019re starting to see that. As you look, there are different confidence indicators that are available as well, and those are starting to trend more positive still \u2013 I want to be clear, I mean, they\u2019re still in more negative territory but directionally moving the right direction in the sense of a more positive direction in terms of overall sentiment.","And we are, and as you look at the forecast change, obviously for Ag & Turf we did bring the sales forecast down slightly but there was, there were couple markets that were a little weaker but some offsetting strength in Europe. So we\u2019re seeing a little bit of improvement but as Susan pointed out, we\u2019re seeing early indications of the possibility that you\u2019re going to start to see some turnaround there.","Q - Adam Uhlman","Okay, thank you.","A - Tony Huegel","Great. Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Next question will be from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Jerry Revich","Hi, good morning.","A - Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Q - Jerry Revich","I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about the decision not to cut production more aggressively in the fourth quarter in Construction & Forestry to reduce that channel inventory. It looks like you\u2019re still planning to build receivables and inventories by $375 million for the year? I guess I\u2019m wondering is that behind the lower margin guidance for 4Q, are you giving yourselves room to reduce the inventory and receivables or should we think that as first half 2016 event?","A - Tony Huegel","Remember, as you think about Construction & Forestry, and we talked about this earlier in the year because there was some question as to why ending receivables and inventory were up as much as they were versus the forecasted sales increase. And as you recall, there were some changes in 2015 related to wholesale terms which we believe was going to drive some higher level of receivables and that has been the case.","So, that\u2019s part of what\u2019s driving that. Now, as you look at the underlying forecast for receivables and inventory, it looks like there was just a slight reduction. Actually, what\u2019s underlying there is more of a reduction in receivables, so field inventory with some offsetting increase in inventory so Deere company-owned inventories.","And again, some of that have to do with final Tier 4 transitions, and plans along that way, as well as recognizing this has been a pretty rapid change in the business environment. There was about seven-point change in our sales outlook. I\u2019m sorry, apparently I said a decrease in receivables, there is an increase in receivables, no, no, a decrease in the forecasted receivables, in the level of forecast.","So, again, we\u2019re still - just to be clear, we\u2019re still forecasting an increase in receivables but it\u2019s less of an increase versus our prior guidance. And inventory is a little higher than in our prior guidance. And again, a combination of final Tier 4 and as well as just the rapid change in that business environment from an inventory perspective.","Q - Jerry Revich","I guess, Tony, part of the question there, are you planning to adjust that in 4Q or is that an early \u201816, you mentioned the quick change in the business environment. Just can you clarify?","A - Tony Huegel","We would always be evaluating as we move forward, and this would be true not just for C&F, this would be true for Ag & Turf as well. We are always evaluating business environment and what we feel we need from an inventory or receivables. So, whether it\u2019s a company owned inventory or a field inventory level. And what I can tell you is we will make those changes as quickly as we can.","And I think fourth quarter last year is a good example of our ability to make those changes very rapidly, if we see the environment changing and necessitating that, so.","Q - Jerry Revich","Thank you.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Tim Thein of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Tim Thein","Thank you, and good morning.","A - Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Q - Tim Thein","Just one question is on pricing and the change albeit probably modest when you break the numbers down. But the overall change in pricing for this year, just curious if you can comment directionally if one of the two segments was a bigger contributor to that? I guess, on Ag Tony, you\u2019ve called out the risk on Ag since late or early calendar year, early part of the calendar year. So, I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s the change or in light of what you just mentioned in terms of the steep drop-off in construction. Just where the delta if any has been greater between the two segments? Thank you.","A - Tony Huegel","Sure. Certainly if you look at our guidance for the year, last quarter we were at 2 points for fiscal year \u201815 and our current guidance is one point. I\u2019ll start with recognizing that both last quarter and this quarter there is some fair amount of rounding to get to that whole number. So we\u2019ve been fluctuating candidly right around 1.5 points.","And we just happen, the last quarter it rounded up and this quarter rounds down. Now, so there hasn\u2019t been a substantial change in the pricing environment since last quarter. And I would say it\u2019s a little bit of both. Certainly I wouldn\u2019t point all to Ag & Turf I mean Construction & Forestry continues to be a challenging environment. We have competitors in the marketplace who are very aggressive on pricing right now. And that hasn\u2019t changed. And if anything has potentially gotten a bit stronger over the year. And so, it is a little bit of a decrease in terms of price realization really coming from both.","Okay, and with that we\u2019ll go to next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning guys.","A - Tony Huegel","Hi Ann.","Q - Ann Duignan","And my question is around your outlook for U.S. farm cash receipts, Tony there is one thing that JPMorgan and Deere have always agreed on and that\u2019s the very strong correlation between cash receipts and equipment sales.","So, in an environment where you\u2019re forecasting a decline in 2016 cash receipts, if that holds up and I realize that it\u2019s a forecast, then isn\u2019t it inconceivable that you would be able to forecast an increase in equipment sales at this point?","A - Tony Huegel","Couple of things there. First of all, keep in mind as you think about cash receipts and I think we would agree on this as well, it\u2019s not necessarily one-for-one in the sense of 2016 cash receipts driving 2016 sales. Remember it\u2019s a combination of both current year and prior year.","So, as you look at while it\u2019s relatively flat from \u201815 to \u201816, when you look at the 2014\/2015 combination that drove last year\u2019s sales, and the 2015\/2016 cash receipts looking in into next year, you\u2019d have to argue that it would be down even more than what just the single year-over-year implications would be.","What I would tell you is, at this point given that outlook in cash receipts, given what we\u2019re seeing and in the very early stages of our early order programs it is likely that you would see some reduction, further reduction in large Ag sales retail sales next year.","Q - Ann Duignan","Okay. That was my question. Thank you, Tony.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Andy Casey","Thanks. Good morning everybody.","A - Tony Huegel","Hi Andy.","Q - Andy Casey","I\u2019m just trying to bridge the operating profit elements, tax and credit guidance for \u201815 to the $1.8 billion net income guidance. Is there any sizeable change in other income or interest expense that\u2019s going to pull down the net income?","A - Tony Huegel","Keep in mind, and again, I hate using this explanation. But do remember that our operating profit outlook forecast for both Ag & Turf and C&F are rounded numbers. And so, it can drive some differences as you come down to operating profit. I wouldn\u2019t cite anything on any of those factors that you just pointed out that would be a significant change for the year.","Obviously on the tax rate, we are as normal. We continue to assume no discreet items and tax rate being in that 34% to 36% range. We\u2019ve had some positive discreet items through the year that have pulled the year-to-date rate down. But we\u2019d use that 34% to 36% for the forward-looking period but outside of that nothing really noteworthy that I could point to.","Q - Andy Casey","Okay, thank you.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Mike Shlisky of Global Hunter Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Mike Shlisky","Good morning guys.","A - Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Q - Mike Shlisky","Last quarter you said in the call that summer weather the crus of the growth story going forward. And if the weather cooperates and yields are above trend-line, it would be challenging to see improvement anywhere around the globe in 2016. But here we are, and it does look in fact like yields will be above trend-lines. So, I\u2019d kind of ask you to follow-up on last quarter, I guess, do you still stand by your statement, and therefore, is the general direction down for 2016 in all regions of the world?","A - Tony Huegel","I would - certainly I would say that I would be a little careful to extrapolate what happens in the U.S. drives global markets. So you would really have to look at that statement would be true if you look at production on a global basis being positive than on a global basis there would be certainly some challenges to see some increases.","And as you look, you see some varying weather patterns but not of any kind of significant factor in that regard. Again, as we look into next year, well we don\u2019t have of course any guidance until next quarter, we are starting to see some positive signs coming from Europe in that regard that certainly as you look at other parts of the world, we\u2019ll see what happens with the growing conditions in Brazil as we move forward. They\u2019re heading towards planting season now and we\u2019ll see what factors might be driven there.","Keep in mind as we go into 2016, we did have some favorable weather conditions, El Nino actually strengthened through the summer. And that certainly bodes well normally for U.S. market or growing areas. But keep in mind that can have some more negative and dry impact on other parts of the world.","So, as you think about weather, there are a number of regions of the world that we would point to on a watch-list if you will of what impact El Nino may have, when you think about Southeast Asia, India, Australia, even Brazil and Argentina, quite often that can drive some very wet spring summer type of weather, which a little bit of extra moisture is good in some cases, but if it\u2019s excessive obviously that can have some negative ramifications as well.","So, we\u2019ll see how things develop as we move forward for the rest of the world. But certainly we did have a very good summer here in the U.S. from a weather perspective at least in aggregate. And you\u2019re seeing that reflected in the guidance or the outlook for yields.","A - Raj Kalathur","Hi Mike, this is Raj. Let me add that broader picture, the weather has been good so far and production for grains on a global basis are likely to be good. Now, the other side of the equation, demand has grown as well, and that\u2019s always been what we are saying, if you take since the mid-90s the demand for grains have grown consistently and it\u2019s grown very nicely this year as well.","So, the demand-supply equilibrium is still pretty tight. You again see like June\/July type conditions where, if there is excess rain or assumptions of any shortfall in weather conditions and the prices just vary quickly. So, again, the demand side is also very healthy.","Q - Mike Shlisky","Great point. Thanks.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Eli Lustgarten","Good morning, everyone.","A - Tony Huegel","Hi Eli.","Q - Eli Lustgarten","Pardon my voice. Can we get some comment, as you look at the fourth quarter and actually on decrementals in the quarter for the fourth quarter, is there anything happening that will alter this, the kind of decremental we saw in the third quarter into the fourth quarter, are we seeing the same levels? And the second part of it is, production being held up and inventory built because of the Labor Contract on October 1 that you\u2019re maybe developing a little bit of a strike an edge inventory being for yourself?","A - Tony Huegel","As you think about fourth quarter and decrementals, implied within the forecast if you look at sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter you would see some higher decrementals. So it would be around 32% for equipment ops is roughly, what\u2019s implied there. But keep in mind you also have a fourth quarter where we\u2019re forecasting the largest reduction in terms of year-over-year sales on a percentage basis at that 24% reduction.","And so, the next closest quarter would have been first quarter where our decrementals were 35%. So, again I would argue sequentially would be a little higher decremental but still very good performance and especially relative to what we in the first quarter, would be very very strong.","There was a hint at the UAW contract we\u2019ll begin negotiations later this month to officially kick those off. Beyond that as agreed on with UAW we really just have no comments related to that. And we\u2019ll have to leave that there. So, we\u2019ll move on to the next caller.","Q - Eli Lustgarten","Thank you.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you.","Operator","Next question will be Mig Dobre with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Mig Dobre","Good morning everyone. I think I\u2019m going to stick with the same line of thinking as Eli here. And obviously, you guys have done a great job in terms of decrementals and in A&T considering the headwinds that you\u2019re dealing with. But I\u2019m wondering here, can you hold these levels of decrementals in to 2016 given that we\u2019re probably talking about yet another decline. I\u2019m wondering if there is more left on variable cost that you can do or are we getting to the point that we\u2019re talking about something that requires larger restructuring, more permanent cost take-out if you would?","A - Raj Kalathur","Okay Mig, this is Raj. Let me take that. Now, you\u2019re asking kind of hypothetical question. For 2016, now don\u2019t take this answer as indicating any forecast for 2016, right. So the answer depends on the mix of products, the level of softness we\u2019re going to see or level of upside we might see in 2016 and several other factors.","Now, if we assume all of the factors stay the same and say demand for all product lines are down by 10% from the 2015 forecasted levels, we should be able to deliver less than 40% decremental margins like we did this year.","And remember, our units prepare not only for the forecasted scenario but also for downside and upside scenarios. And we expect to manage assets and costs with discipline as always to deliver at least 12% operating, return on operating assets at about 80% of mid-cycle.","And at the enterprise level, we have plans in place for 2016 SA&G, R&D and on the cash side capital expenditures. And if we are able to execute with discipline to our plans as we normally have, we should deliver decent decremental or incremental margins depending on the scenario we face.","Q - Mig Dobre","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Raj.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from David Raso of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - David Raso","Thank you. I apologize in advance for making this a math question, but guys, I\u2019m sorry I need to understand this because obviously the fourth quarter is going to influence how people think about \u201816. I know you mentioned rounding Tony but I heard you correctly, C&F margins for the full year 10%, Ag & Turf 8%, that\u2019s just a clarification, correct me if I\u2019m wrong.","A - Tony Huegel","That\u2019s correct, yes.","Q - David Raso","If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019re implying the Construction & Forestry margins in fourth quarter to go up from 8.4% this quarter to 10.3%. You\u2019re implying the segment profits to be at a level that does not collaborates a net income number to get the full-year to $1.8 billion, I mean, it\u2019s literally like $0.30 of EPS off, it\u2019s a difference between $0.65 implied to the fourth quarter versus roughly $0.95. So, I apologize but if you can please just for modeling here for the whole street going forward, can you help us understand that\u2019s not rounding?","If you stick with your Ag, and you go well, that the wiggles in Construction, it\u2019s the difference between saying C&F margins are 10% in the fourth quarter or break-even. So, please just indulge us, walk us through what are you really implying about segment margins for the fourth quarter or are you maybe sandbagging the net income implied to the fourth quarter. Just the math, it just doesn\u2019t make sense?","A - Tony Huegel","I\u2019m not following necessarily your math on, especially on C&F.","Q - David Raso","Tony, the math, am I wrong you\u2019re saying sales for the year at $6.252 billion right, that\u2019s 5% down, 10% margins are $625 million, that\u2019s a full year EBIT, we only have $464 million year-to-date, so you need profits of $161 million in the fourth quarter to get your full-year C&F. And on these revenues that\u2019s a 10.3% margin for the fourth quarter its, just the math?","A - Tony Huegel","If you do a full 10% and if that 10% was exactly 10.0%, I would agree with you. But as I said before, remember, when we say 10% that\u2019s anywhere from 9.5% to 10.4% round to\u2026","Q - David Raso","I don\u2019t mean to make this a math question, but the fourth quarter margin on C&F, even if you get anywhere near that rounding issue, it\u2019s implying a segment EBIT for the whole company well above what you\u2019re implying net income to be to the fourth quarter, I mean, it\u2019s a positive story, maybe it is cushion in the net income number and you think the segments do these numbers, and that\u2019s great.","So, I\u2019m not making a bullish or bearish comment here, I\u2019m just trying to make sure I understand that math doesn\u2019t make sense, it could wildly swing the C&F margin for the fourth quarter and thus influence people\u2019s thoughts on how they model C&F into \u201816? And if need to take it offline that\u2019s fine, but this is not rounding?","A - Tony Huegel","We will have to take it offline, but remember again as I said, this is both the margins are rounded. And so, again, just like we had with pricing there are times when you\u2019re rounding it can be more aggressive than other times.","So you have to take that into consideration as you\u2019re trying to reconcile down to where we are with our net income number. And so, beyond that there is really not much more I can say. When we follow-up later, we can certainly discuss this a bit more.","Q - David Raso","I appreciate it. And again, I apologize for the math. I just wanted to clarify. So thank you. We\u2019ll talk later.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Vishal Shah","Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. Tony, can you maybe comment on the extent of over capacity that you think is coming out of your oil patch and how long it will take to get some of that capacity to be absorbed and the headwinds to overcome? Thank you."," ","A - Raj Kalathur","C&F. Energy Sector."," ","A \u2013 Tony Huegel","I think from our perspective, our dealers tend to react pretty quickly when they see some of those changes in terms of their end demand. We are hearing, and again, as Susan pointed out in her comments, when you think about C&F, there is little bit of dichotomy because you talk to our contractors, our dealers, the sentiment is generally - fairly positive especially outside of those energy impacted areas.","The underlying fundamentals that we would normally point to are actually fairly positive year-over-year. We\u2019re just seeing a softness in orders. And certainly in energy is weaker year-over-year. You\u2019re hearing some, there is commentary about some of the independent rental companies for example shifting inventory out of those areas that are more energy dependent into the rest of the country. And that is in fairly large sizes, some large auctions and in places like Western Canada, in more recent months, so those sorts of things can have some impact.","So, again, we\u2019ll see as we move forward where this market ends up going. But both in current year as well as you look out into 2016, most of the indications from a general economic perspective would be relatively positive. But again, as I started to say, our dealers respond quickly with our order fulfillment process and the ability for them to replenish equipment very rapidly.","They tend to when there is uncertainty, they tend to pull-back quickly and adjust their inventories very rapidly which is exactly what we would hope to see. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve seen in the quarter as well as is those dealers making those adjustments quickly.","And with that, we\u2019ll go ahead with the next caller.","Operator","Next question is from Nicole DeBlase with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Nicole DeBlase","Yes, thanks good morning guys.","A - Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Q - Nicole DeBlase","I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but I\u2019m going to try to ask this in a really simple way. So, pricing you guys are now seeing 1% growth for the full year, my math suggests that that implies negative pricing in the fourth quarter, can you just confirm if you think pricing goes negative in 4Q or if it\u2019s just decelerating from what we\u2019ve seen in 2Q and 3Q?","A - Tony Huegel","Yes, our forecast would not be negative in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind as you think about that as I mentioned earlier, remember there is rounding in that number. So, even within some of the other prior quarters, third quarter for example, we were actually running much closely to that 1.5 points versus, even in our prior forecast when you saw the 2 points we were rounding up to that 2 points. Now we\u2019re rounding down to 1 point. And so, the implied change from last quarter to this quarter isn\u2019t a full point.","Q - Nicole DeBlase","Okay. That makes total sense, thanks for clarifying.","A - Tony Huegel","And just to clarify, both divisions while we don\u2019t talk about details by division, both divisions are forecasting positive price in the fourth quarter.","Q - Nicole DeBlase","Okay, thank you.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Joel Tiss with BMO Asset Management. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Joel Tiss","Hi, I just have one for Raj. I just wondered if you can talk to us why the free cash flow seemed so weak in the quarter or for the year-to-date given how much inventories are coming down?","A - Raj Kalathur","So, I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re saying it\u2019s weaker. The previous forecast for cash flow from operations was $3.4 billion, the current is about $3.2 billion, but $100 million should be explained by our net income in our guidance reduction from $1.9 billion to $1.8 billion, and the rest of that is essentially working capital. By the way the $3.2 billion, as we actually achieve would be I think the third best in recent history if not the third best ever.","Q - Joel Tiss","My question was about free cash flow though not operating and year-to-date it\u2019s about $800 million down from $1.5 billion last year. And so, with almost $1 billion of inventory coming out year-to-date I wondered why it looks like it\u2019s a lot lower than just the inventory reduction?","A - Raj Kalathur","I think we look at operating cash flow, if you look at - if you reduce the capital, the capital expenditures are actually, our forecast for capital expenditures, last quarter to this quarter has actually come down. So, I still am not adding up what you\u2019re adding up yet, so.","Q - Joel Tiss","Okay, all right.","A - Tony Huegel","We can take that offline too and talk about a little bit more detail, but yes, actually again, I think as you look for the year, we\u2019re certainly continuing to forecast we think very strong cash flow, down a little bit as receivables and inventory adjusted in the quarter versus prior guidance, is that adjusted in the quarter but still very healthy level of cash flow.","Okay, next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Seth Weber","Hi, good morning everybody.","A - Tony Huegel","Hello.","Q - Seth Weber","Hello, hi, can you hear me?","A - Tony Huegel","I can.","Q - Seth Weber","Great, thanks. So, the decremental margins in the Construction business, Construction & Forestry about 29%, it looks like you\u2019re forecasting something around 30% for the fourth quarter. If revenues are down next year, is the 30% decremental the right way to think about Construction & Forestry for next year? And maybe can you comment on mix that you\u2019re seeing there?","A - Tony Huegel","Yes, I think normally we would be, some of that can be mix driven to your point. And I think as you think about that decremental, especially in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter, keeping in mind some of that is caused by the rapid change in the environment. So, as you think about pulling some of the levers we would pull, those sorts of things, there are lead times on that.","So, if we would continue to see negative sales going into 2016, certainly that division would be looking at ways to improve the decremental sounds like an odd way to say it, but to see lower levels of decrementals.","Q - Seth Weber","Lower, relative to the 30%?","A - Tony Huegel","Yes.","Q - Seth Weber","Okay, thank you very much.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Ross Gilardi","Hi, good morning everybody.","A - Tony Huegel","Hi Ross.","Q - Ross Gilardi","I guess, I just want to ask you quickly about South America, and you\u2019ve taken your outlook down for Ag again. But I mean, the data that\u2019s come out year-to-date still feels like a lot worse than that outlook. So, what are you seeing there, I mean, is the data overall in both Ag and Construction in Brazil just feel terrible. And I know Deere\u2019s obviously bullish on the long-term. But any signs of stability at all, why down only 20% to 25%?","A - Tony Huegel","Well, first of all, I would keep one thing to keep in mind is as you\u2019re looking at year-to-date data out of Brazil, that\u2019s a calendar basis. And we would be looking at a fiscal basis, so we still have within our outlook for fiscal 2015 we still have November\/December of last year where those FINAME rates were still at very low levels relative to where they are today. And so I think that maybe some of the change in terms of what our outlook is versus maybe what you\u2019re seeing in the calendar year-to-date numbers.","Q - Ross Gilardi","Okay. Just can you comment at all? It was all, meant to be kind of wrapped up in one question, just your thoughts on stabilization at all there? It just doesn\u2019t feel like the data \u2013 it feel like the data is still in the process of getting worse not better?","A - Tony Huegel","Yes, I think it\u2019s FINAME financing I would argue has created some stabilization with the announcement earlier this year of rates really through next June of 2016. The funding seems to be appropriate, so they didn\u2019t increase it from where rates went to in April of this year. And so, there is some stability there of course, there is always risk that that can change.","And again, the funding that was announced is, we believe at a very appropriate level for the business, so that\u2019s one positive aspect. But I think FX creates certainly uncertainty in the environment, farmers there have benefited from the weakening of the real in this year as they sell their crops in U.S. dollars and they convert that back. It\u2019s actually kept their cash receipts and margins pretty favorable. But there is always the risk of when does that change and move back the other direction.","So, there is uncertainty there. And more importantly just around the general economy and that doesn\u2019t seem to be seeing much stabilization at this point. I\u2019d argue that\u2019s probably the biggest risk as we move next year.","Q - Ross Gilardi","Got it, thanks Tony.","A - Tony Huegel","Okay. Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Kwame Webb with Morningstar. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Kwame Webb","Good morning everyone.","A - Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Q - Kwame Webb","So, maybe just a little bit of a longer-term question, I know you guys have been doing a lot on the Telematics front, recent acquisition in Brazil. Can you just kind of talk about what are the product development priorities there? And then just any commentary on what if renewal rates been for products like JDLink once customers get beyond the trial period?","A - Tony Huegel","Yes, at this point we really haven\u2019t talked about any kind of renewal rate publicly and that sort of thing but clearly as we\u2019ve talked about longer term from intelligence in machinery that\u2019s a key focus that we continue to have especially around machine and job optimization functions.","From an R&D perspective I think we\u2019ve talked about as well, certainly increasing the amount that we\u2019re spending in that area today. What we spend on intelligence would be comparable to the type of R&D we would have on things like large tractors or combines. So it\u2019s certainly right up in parity.","With that and again just reflects the importance that we see of intelligence as we move forward. And we think we have a great opportunity to continue to provide efficiency to our customers through intelligence and believe that will be a way that we continue to differentiate as we move forward.","Q - Kwame Webb","Just, if you aren\u2019t willing to give like a hard number, maybe just some commentary on whether it\u2019s trended, renewal rates have been in-line, below or better than expectations?","A - Tony Huegel","Yes, that\u2019s just not something we\u2019ve commented on publicly. So we\u2019re going to have to move on to the final call. We have time for one more call. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question will be from Larry De Maria with William Blair & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Larry De Maria","Hi, thanks, hi Tony. I guess, not to go back and harp on the book order but if they\u2019re similar to last year, obviously that implies down double-digit, which means that large Ag probably is down like you said. I think you would hope for a flat demand next year and have inventory in shape, which would give you positive delta for next year.","So, I\u2019m just wondering where we stand now, do you think Deere and field inventory can get into relatively decent shape at year-end? And then therefore what kind of order of magnitude if not do we need in production cuts into next year do you think to kind of right-size things?","A - Tony Huegel","Right. First of all I want to be clear we did not have guidance on 2016. I think a lot of people implied some of our commentary to assume we were looking at flat for 2016. We were using that as an example, just like Raj earlier mentioned if it were down 10% what would our decremental margins be, I want to be clear we are not trying to signal down 10% for next year on all product lines, that\u2019s just an example.","And we similarly use that really to reflect the fact that as we under-produce this year, you don\u2019t need an increase in end-markets, retail sales to necessarily see an increase in Deere sales.","But clearly as you look at the early order programs, I want to be clear there as well. We\u2019re down year-over-year we\u2019re not talking about seeing the type of magnitude of decrease that we saw last year but certainly down directionally is what we\u2019re seeing in those early order programs at this point. So, in that regard we certainly have under-produced this year from a new inventory perspective.","Certainly we feel like, our inventories will be in good shape. But as I mentioned earlier in the call, we will have some additional challenges to work through next year on used equipment especially as it relates to large tractors. Beyond that there is not much more I can really say about 2016.","End of Q&A","Tony Huegel","So, we appreciate your call. But we\u2019re going to have to wrap up.

Susan?","Susan Karlix","John Deere announced its third quarter earnings today. And in our view, it was a solid performance in light of the weak conditions in the global agricultural sector. Deere\u2019s results reflected the sound execution of our operating plans and the success of efforts to manage costs.","Although results were lower than in the same quarter a year ago, all of our businesses remained solidly profitable. As a result the company continues to be well positioned to meet the needs of customers while funding its growth plans and returning cash to stockholders.","Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at the third quarter in detail beginning on slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 20% to $7.594 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $512 million. EPS was $1.53 in the quarter.","On slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 22% to $6.8 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by two points. Currency translation was negative by six points.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let\u2019s start with Agriculture & Turf on slide 5. Net sales were down 24% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in all regions of the world, but the decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes of large Ag equipment in the United States and Canada. Also hurting sales was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange.","Operating profit was $472 million. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by lower shipment volume, a less favorable product mix and foreign exchange partially offset by price realization and lower production cost. The division\u2019s decremental margin the quarter was 28%, quite respectable considering the decrease in large Ag sales.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let\u2019s look at fundamentals affecting the Ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts, our 2014 forecast calls for cash receipts of about $418 billion, up about 1% from 2013, and the highest level ever recorded.","Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and consequently the lower commodity prices we\u2019re seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 7%.","Looking ahead to next year, based on our expectation of - above trend-line yields for 2015 and declining livestock prices, our very early forecast calls for total cash receipts to be down slightly in 2016.","On slide 7, global grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels, even after the abundant harvests of the past two years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong, while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tensions could disrupt trade, lower production, reduce stocks-to-use ratio, and result in prices quickly moving higher.","Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on slide 8. Gradual economic growth continues in the region. While grain prices appear to be stabilizing at levels near the long-term average, the dairy sector remains under pressure. As a result, farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be lower for the year. I should mention, we are encouraged by some early indications that this market maybe in the early stages of recovery.","On slide 9, you\u2019ll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In China, the government\u2019s continued investment in equipment subsidies and mechanizations are supportive of agriculture. However, the economic slowdown and lower commodity prices have led to a decrease in forecast industry sales.","Turning to India, positive consumer and investors sentiment are encouraging economic growth. While the government continues to support agriculture, two consecutive below normal monsoon seasons are hurting the farm sector. In the CIS, continued deterioration of economic growth and further tightening of credit continue to weigh on equipment sales. Notably, western equipment manufacturers are being heavily affected by the weak Russian currency and geopolitical uncertainties.","Shifting to Brazil, slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness. Ag production is expected to decrease about 11% for the year in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices.","However, with the weak real, the value of production is much more attractive in the local currency, up about 10% that\u2019s because Brazilian farmers sell their crops in dollars. Even with the recent drop in prices, Ag fundamentals remain positive for grains. Our early forecast calls for the value of production to be down slightly in 2016.","Slide 11 illustrates eligible finance rates for Ag equipment in Brazil. The 2015\/2016 Ag budget affirmed eligible finance rates for Ag equipment are 7.5% and 9%, through the end of June 2016 depending on a farmer\u2019s revenues, with no change on the required down payment.","So, rates have increased, they are not considerably higher than they were in 2011 which was a banner year for industry sales in Brazil. And they remain below current market rates of about 14%. Nonetheless, farmer confidence is lower as a result of these rising interest rates, economic uncertainty and political concerns, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. Still, long term fundamentals for the Ag business in Brazil are solid.","Our 2015 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on slide 12. Lower commodity prices and falling farm incomes are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, especially larger models. At the same time, conditions in the livestock sector are more positive, providing support to sales of small and mid-sized tractors. We continue to expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 25% for 2015.","The EU 28 industry outlook is down about 10%, unchanged from last quarter, due to lower crop prices and farm income, as well as pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 20% to 25% in 2015, a reflection of the factors already discussed.","Shifting to Asia, we now expect sales to be down moderately with most of the decline in India and China. In the CIS, we continue to expect industry sales to be down significantly, due to limited credit availability, the weak ruble and overall economic concerns.","Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2015, no change from our prior forecast.","Putting this all together on slide 13, fiscal year 2015 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 25%, including about five points of negative currency translation. Our forecast for the Ag & Turf divisions operating margin continues to be approximately 8%.","Now let\u2019s focus on Construction & Forestry on slide 14. Net sales were down 13% in the quarter and operating profit was down 34% due to lower shipment volumes and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency. The division\u2019s decremental margin was 29%.","Moving to slide 15, looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide. GDP growth is positive, unemployment is falling, construction hiring is on the increase, and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units this year.","In spite of these encouraging economic indicators and positive dealer and customer sentiment, we are seeing weakening in our order books. Some contributing factors to the slowdown in demand are the conditions in the energy sector and energy producing regions, wet weather that slowed construction activities this spring and summer, the decline in rental utilization rates and sluggish economic growth outside the United States.","As a result, Deere\u2019s Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 5% in 2015. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about three points. Global forestry markets are now expected to be flat to up 5% on the heels of a 10% increase in 2014, as gains in the U.S. and Europe are offset by declines in other regions of the world. C&F\u2019s full year operating margin is now projected to be about 10%.","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operations. Slide 16, shows annualized provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average owned portfolio was 12 basis points at the end of July. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios.","The financial forecast for 2015 now contemplates a lot provision of about 13 basis points versus 9 basis points in 2014. The increase is a reflection of unsustainably low loss levels of the last four years. It remains well below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and the 15-year average of 43 points.","Moving to slide 17, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $153 million in the third quarter versus $162 million last year. Lower results for the quarter were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, partially offset by lower selling administrative and general expenses. The division\u2019s forecast net income attributable to Deere & Company remains at about $630 million for the year.","Slide 18 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $1.5 billion. That\u2019s equal to 30.6% of prior 12-month sales compared with 29.8% a year ago. We expect to end the year with total receivables and inventories down about $350 million. With this decrease forecast to come entirely from Ag & Turf, the division will have reduced receivables and inventories by almost $2 billion over the last two years. At constant exchange rates, the two-year decline is about $1.4 billion.","Our 2015 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales, shown on slide 19, is about 78%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2015, keep these factors in mind: price realizations of about one point; favorable raw material costs; an unfavorable mix of product and Tier 4 product costs.","With respect to R&D expense on slide 20, R&D was down 4% in the third quarter, including four points of negative currency translation. So, essentially flat on a constant exchange basis. Our 2015 forecast now calls for R&D to be down about 2% for the full year, including about three points of negative currency translation.","Moving now to slide 21, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 7% in the third quarter, including five points of currency translation. Our 2015 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 11% with landscapes, water, incentive compensation and currency accounting for about nine points of the change.","Turning to slide 22, pension and OPEB expense was up $25 million in the quarter and is forecast to be up about $70 million in 2015.","On slide 23, the equipment operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter. For the remainder of fiscal 2015, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.","Slide 24 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $3.2 billion in 2015.","The company\u2019s fourth quarter financial outlook is on slide 25. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 24% compared with 2014. This includes about one point of price realization with unfavorable currency translation of about five points.","Turning to slide 26 and the full-year outlook, the forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 21%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about one point with negative currency translation of about four points.","Finally, our forecast now calls for net income attributable to Deere & Company to be about $1.8 billion for the full year.","As a closing thought, John Deere is well on its way to another good year and doing so in the face of some pretty significant headwinds. Our performance highlights our success establishing a wider range of revenue sources and a more durable business model.","As a result, the company is showing great resilience and discipline and performing much better than in previous farm downturns. Longer term, we believe our steady investment in new products and geographies will make Deere the provider of choice for a growing global customer base.","What\u2019s more, we believe the impact of these actions will become increasingly clear as the end-markets for our products start moving ahead. These are just some of the reasons we have confidence in the company\u2019s present course and in our ability to deliver significant value to customers and investors well into the future.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Tony.","Tony Huegel","Thanks Susan. Now we\u2019re ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Our operator David will instruct you on the polling procedure. But, in considerations of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. David?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question today will be from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning.","A - Tony Huegel","Hi Jamie.","Q - Jamie Cook","Hi, I guess two questions. One, Tony, could you or Susan or Raj speak to where you guys are relative to expectation with regards to inventory in the channel, that\u2019s a big concern in the market and how that sort of impacts2016? And whether the excess inventory rolls into \u201816? And then I guess my second question is if you could just give us some color on the order book, the early order book so far? Thanks.","A - Tony Huegel","In the spirit of one question, I\u2019ll go ahead and answer your first one and then we\u2019ll pick the second one up hopefully from someone else or I\u2019ll ask you to get back in the queue, okay.","Q - Jamie Cook","Okay.","A - Tony Huegel","So, as we think about inventory, and I\u2019ll split it between new and used inventory, and I\u2019m assuming, you\u2019re primarily looking at large Ag in the U.S. and Canada?","Q - Jamie Cook","Of course.","A - Tony Huegel","Okay. As you think about new inventory and I would say similar situation to what we talked about in the past, in the sense that we continue to have new inventory well below the competitors. We tend to have 50% or less as you look at inventory as a percent of sales and that continues to be the case. We continue to evaluate that of course as we go through the year and see various changes in the market.","Used equipment continues to be a challenge. We are making good progress on used equipment. As you look at some of the factors from a large Ag perspective, we\u2019re down about 10% year-over-year in July in terms of where we\u2019re at with used inventory. Pricing is holding in okay, if you look at it kind of from a two-year average, we would be slightly below that. But believe we continue to maintain a healthy premium versus our competition.","And again, we are making progress but it\u2019s likely we would expect these efforts will continue into 2016, we continue to coordinate with our dealers to assist with the movement of the used equipment. But it is still especially on large tractors continues to be a challenge that we\u2019re working on within the market.","Q - Jamie Cook","Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Your next question will be from Steven Fisher with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Steven Fisher","Great, thanks, good morning. So, I guess, I\u2019ll pick up on the second half of Jamie\u2019s question on how early order programs are trending year-over-year and specifically if you could talk also about your approach to incentives year-over-year on the early order program?","A - Tony Huegel","One of the challenges that we do have in terms of comparison year-over-year is there are some timing differences in terms of when we have various phases of the early order programs. And the closing of the first phase is a bit different year-over-year.","Now, having said that, so, I just want to make sure I have that clearly out front but directionally what we\u2019re seeing is order activity on those early order programs are off year-over-year. And just to be clear, what we\u2019re talking about is planters sprayers and tillage. A lot of people will have questions around combine early order programs I\u2019m guessing, but remember those just started up in early August. And candidly it\u2019s just too early to make any type of conclusions related to where that program is.","One of the challenges we do have also as you think about the spring seasonal early order programs, and where we would think that perhaps in this current environment where they may not be as close of a correlation to overall, or as good of an indicator of overall demand going into next year, is the fact that they do have a much higher level of stock component versus retail orders in those spring seasonal order programs.","And again, given the dynamics in the market, there is candidly not as much pressure to put orders in at this particular point. And we really believe the combine early order program, as that continues to develop, will be a better indicator of actual demand. And again, I want to be clear, I\u2019m not trying to skirt the issue, certainly we are seeing in those early order programs, orders being off year-over-year which historically would indicate some additional weakening as you move into 2016.","Q - Steven Fisher","Can you say what degree of magnitude they\u2019re off year-over-year?","A - Tony Huegel","Similar to last year we aren\u2019t going to discuss the magnitude again, because and some of that goes back to the timing of the ending of the early order program. And it could give some misleading numbers both, more positive or more negative depending on the program in terms of when they actually close. So, but again, it is directionally down year-over-year. So we will go to the next.","Q - Steven Fisher","Thanks a lot.","A - Tony Huegel","Okay, thank you. Next question.","Operator","Next question is from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Adam Uhlman","Hi guys, good morning.","A - Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Q - Adam Uhlman","Could you talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing in Europe, you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing some early stage of recovery in that market, maybe talk to your orders on a year-over-year basis for the quarter, do you expect to hit positive sales anytime soon? What are you looking for to confirm that early stage of recovery? Thanks.","A - Tony Huegel","Sure. I think some of that, as you look at the general economy, we\u2019re starting to see that. As you look, there are different confidence indicators that are available as well, and those are starting to trend more positive still \u2013 I want to be clear, I mean, they\u2019re still in more negative territory but directionally moving the right direction in the sense of a more positive direction in terms of overall sentiment.","And we are, and as you look at the forecast change, obviously for Ag & Turf we did bring the sales forecast down slightly but there was, there were couple markets that were a little weaker but some offsetting strength in Europe. So we\u2019re seeing a little bit of improvement but as Susan pointed out, we\u2019re seeing early indications of the possibility that you\u2019re going to start to see some turnaround there.","Q - Adam Uhlman","Okay, thank you.","A - Tony Huegel","Great. Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Next question will be from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Jerry Revich","Hi, good morning.","A - Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Q - Jerry Revich","I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about the decision not to cut production more aggressively in the fourth quarter in Construction & Forestry to reduce that channel inventory. It looks like you\u2019re still planning to build receivables and inventories by $375 million for the year? I guess I\u2019m wondering is that behind the lower margin guidance for 4Q, are you giving yourselves room to reduce the inventory and receivables or should we think that as first half 2016 event?","A - Tony Huegel","Remember, as you think about Construction & Forestry, and we talked about this earlier in the year because there was some question as to why ending receivables and inventory were up as much as they were versus the forecasted sales increase. And as you recall, there were some changes in 2015 related to wholesale terms which we believe was going to drive some higher level of receivables and that has been the case.","So, that\u2019s part of what\u2019s driving that. Now, as you look at the underlying forecast for receivables and inventory, it looks like there was just a slight reduction. Actually, what\u2019s underlying there is more of a reduction in receivables, so field inventory with some offsetting increase in inventory so Deere company-owned inventories.","And again, some of that have to do with final Tier 4 transitions, and plans along that way, as well as recognizing this has been a pretty rapid change in the business environment. There was about seven-point change in our sales outlook. I\u2019m sorry, apparently I said a decrease in receivables, there is an increase in receivables, no, no, a decrease in the forecasted receivables, in the level of forecast.","So, again, we\u2019re still - just to be clear, we\u2019re still forecasting an increase in receivables but it\u2019s less of an increase versus our prior guidance. And inventory is a little higher than in our prior guidance. And again, a combination of final Tier 4 and as well as just the rapid change in that business environment from an inventory perspective.","Q - Jerry Revich","I guess, Tony, part of the question there, are you planning to adjust that in 4Q or is that an early \u201816, you mentioned the quick change in the business environment. Just can you clarify?","A - Tony Huegel","We would always be evaluating as we move forward, and this would be true not just for C&F, this would be true for Ag & Turf as well. We are always evaluating business environment and what we feel we need from an inventory or receivables. So, whether it\u2019s a company owned inventory or a field inventory level. And what I can tell you is we will make those changes as quickly as we can.","And I think fourth quarter last year is a good example of our ability to make those changes very rapidly, if we see the environment changing and necessitating that, so.","Q - Jerry Revich","Thank you.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Tim Thein of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Tim Thein","Thank you, and good morning.","A - Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Q - Tim Thein","Just one question is on pricing and the change albeit probably modest when you break the numbers down. But the overall change in pricing for this year, just curious if you can comment directionally if one of the two segments was a bigger contributor to that? I guess, on Ag Tony, you\u2019ve called out the risk on Ag since late or early calendar year, early part of the calendar year. So, I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s the change or in light of what you just mentioned in terms of the steep drop-off in construction. Just where the delta if any has been greater between the two segments? Thank you.","A - Tony Huegel","Sure. Certainly if you look at our guidance for the year, last quarter we were at 2 points for fiscal year \u201815 and our current guidance is one point. I\u2019ll start with recognizing that both last quarter and this quarter there is some fair amount of rounding to get to that whole number. So we\u2019ve been fluctuating candidly right around 1.5 points.","And we just happen, the last quarter it rounded up and this quarter rounds down. Now, so there hasn\u2019t been a substantial change in the pricing environment since last quarter. And I would say it\u2019s a little bit of both. Certainly I wouldn\u2019t point all to Ag & Turf I mean Construction & Forestry continues to be a challenging environment. We have competitors in the marketplace who are very aggressive on pricing right now. And that hasn\u2019t changed. And if anything has potentially gotten a bit stronger over the year. And so, it is a little bit of a decrease in terms of price realization really coming from both.","Okay, and with that we\u2019ll go to next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning guys.","A - Tony Huegel","Hi Ann.","Q - Ann Duignan","And my question is around your outlook for U.S. farm cash receipts, Tony there is one thing that JPMorgan and Deere have always agreed on and that\u2019s the very strong correlation between cash receipts and equipment sales.","So, in an environment where you\u2019re forecasting a decline in 2016 cash receipts, if that holds up and I realize that it\u2019s a forecast, then isn\u2019t it inconceivable that you would be able to forecast an increase in equipment sales at this point?","A - Tony Huegel","Couple of things there. First of all, keep in mind as you think about cash receipts and I think we would agree on this as well, it\u2019s not necessarily one-for-one in the sense of 2016 cash receipts driving 2016 sales. Remember it\u2019s a combination of both current year and prior year.","So, as you look at while it\u2019s relatively flat from \u201815 to \u201816, when you look at the 2014\/2015 combination that drove last year\u2019s sales, and the 2015\/2016 cash receipts looking in into next year, you\u2019d have to argue that it would be down even more than what just the single year-over-year implications would be.","What I would tell you is, at this point given that outlook in cash receipts, given what we\u2019re seeing and in the very early stages of our early order programs it is likely that you would see some reduction, further reduction in large Ag sales retail sales next year.","Q - Ann Duignan","Okay. That was my question. Thank you, Tony.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Andy Casey","Thanks. Good morning everybody.","A - Tony Huegel","Hi Andy.","Q - Andy Casey","I\u2019m just trying to bridge the operating profit elements, tax and credit guidance for \u201815 to the $1.8 billion net income guidance. Is there any sizeable change in other income or interest expense that\u2019s going to pull down the net income?","A - Tony Huegel","Keep in mind, and again, I hate using this explanation. But do remember that our operating profit outlook forecast for both Ag & Turf and C&F are rounded numbers. And so, it can drive some differences as you come down to operating profit. I wouldn\u2019t cite anything on any of those factors that you just pointed out that would be a significant change for the year.","Obviously on the tax rate, we are as normal. We continue to assume no discreet items and tax rate being in that 34% to 36% range. We\u2019ve had some positive discreet items through the year that have pulled the year-to-date rate down. But we\u2019d use that 34% to 36% for the forward-looking period but outside of that nothing really noteworthy that I could point to.","Q - Andy Casey","Okay, thank you.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Mike Shlisky of Global Hunter Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Mike Shlisky","Good morning guys.","A - Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Q - Mike Shlisky","Last quarter you said in the call that summer weather the crus of the growth story going forward. And if the weather cooperates and yields are above trend-line, it would be challenging to see improvement anywhere around the globe in 2016. But here we are, and it does look in fact like yields will be above trend-lines. So, I\u2019d kind of ask you to follow-up on last quarter, I guess, do you still stand by your statement, and therefore, is the general direction down for 2016 in all regions of the world?","A - Tony Huegel","I would - certainly I would say that I would be a little careful to extrapolate what happens in the U.S. drives global markets. So you would really have to look at that statement would be true if you look at production on a global basis being positive than on a global basis there would be certainly some challenges to see some increases.","And as you look, you see some varying weather patterns but not of any kind of significant factor in that regard. Again, as we look into next year, well we don\u2019t have of course any guidance until next quarter, we are starting to see some positive signs coming from Europe in that regard that certainly as you look at other parts of the world, we\u2019ll see what happens with the growing conditions in Brazil as we move forward. They\u2019re heading towards planting season now and we\u2019ll see what factors might be driven there.","Keep in mind as we go into 2016, we did have some favorable weather conditions, El Nino actually strengthened through the summer. And that certainly bodes well normally for U.S. market or growing areas. But keep in mind that can have some more negative and dry impact on other parts of the world.","So, as you think about weather, there are a number of regions of the world that we would point to on a watch-list if you will of what impact El Nino may have, when you think about Southeast Asia, India, Australia, even Brazil and Argentina, quite often that can drive some very wet spring summer type of weather, which a little bit of extra moisture is good in some cases, but if it\u2019s excessive obviously that can have some negative ramifications as well.","So, we\u2019ll see how things develop as we move forward for the rest of the world. But certainly we did have a very good summer here in the U.S. from a weather perspective at least in aggregate. And you\u2019re seeing that reflected in the guidance or the outlook for yields.","A - Raj Kalathur","Hi Mike, this is Raj. Let me add that broader picture, the weather has been good so far and production for grains on a global basis are likely to be good. Now, the other side of the equation, demand has grown as well, and that\u2019s always been what we are saying, if you take since the mid-90s the demand for grains have grown consistently and it\u2019s grown very nicely this year as well.","So, the demand-supply equilibrium is still pretty tight. You again see like June\/July type conditions where, if there is excess rain or assumptions of any shortfall in weather conditions and the prices just vary quickly. So, again, the demand side is also very healthy.","Q - Mike Shlisky","Great point. Thanks.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Eli Lustgarten","Good morning, everyone.","A - Tony Huegel","Hi Eli.","Q - Eli Lustgarten","Pardon my voice. Can we get some comment, as you look at the fourth quarter and actually on decrementals in the quarter for the fourth quarter, is there anything happening that will alter this, the kind of decremental we saw in the third quarter into the fourth quarter, are we seeing the same levels? And the second part of it is, production being held up and inventory built because of the Labor Contract on October 1 that you\u2019re maybe developing a little bit of a strike an edge inventory being for yourself?","A - Tony Huegel","As you think about fourth quarter and decrementals, implied within the forecast if you look at sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter you would see some higher decrementals. So it would be around 32% for equipment ops is roughly, what\u2019s implied there. But keep in mind you also have a fourth quarter where we\u2019re forecasting the largest reduction in terms of year-over-year sales on a percentage basis at that 24% reduction.","And so, the next closest quarter would have been first quarter where our decrementals were 35%. So, again I would argue sequentially would be a little higher decremental but still very good performance and especially relative to what we in the first quarter, would be very very strong.","There was a hint at the UAW contract we\u2019ll begin negotiations later this month to officially kick those off. Beyond that as agreed on with UAW we really just have no comments related to that. And we\u2019ll have to leave that there. So, we\u2019ll move on to the next caller.","Q - Eli Lustgarten","Thank you.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you.","Operator","Next question will be Mig Dobre with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Mig Dobre","Good morning everyone. I think I\u2019m going to stick with the same line of thinking as Eli here. And obviously, you guys have done a great job in terms of decrementals and in A&T considering the headwinds that you\u2019re dealing with. But I\u2019m wondering here, can you hold these levels of decrementals in to 2016 given that we\u2019re probably talking about yet another decline. I\u2019m wondering if there is more left on variable cost that you can do or are we getting to the point that we\u2019re talking about something that requires larger restructuring, more permanent cost take-out if you would?","A - Raj Kalathur","Okay Mig, this is Raj. Let me take that. Now, you\u2019re asking kind of hypothetical question. For 2016, now don\u2019t take this answer as indicating any forecast for 2016, right. So the answer depends on the mix of products, the level of softness we\u2019re going to see or level of upside we might see in 2016 and several other factors.","Now, if we assume all of the factors stay the same and say demand for all product lines are down by 10% from the 2015 forecasted levels, we should be able to deliver less than 40% decremental margins like we did this year.","And remember, our units prepare not only for the forecasted scenario but also for downside and upside scenarios. And we expect to manage assets and costs with discipline as always to deliver at least 12% operating, return on operating assets at about 80% of mid-cycle.","And at the enterprise level, we have plans in place for 2016 SA&G, R&D and on the cash side capital expenditures. And if we are able to execute with discipline to our plans as we normally have, we should deliver decent decremental or incremental margins depending on the scenario we face.","Q - Mig Dobre","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Raj.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from David Raso of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - David Raso","Thank you. I apologize in advance for making this a math question, but guys, I\u2019m sorry I need to understand this because obviously the fourth quarter is going to influence how people think about \u201816. I know you mentioned rounding Tony but I heard you correctly, C&F margins for the full year 10%, Ag & Turf 8%, that\u2019s just a clarification, correct me if I\u2019m wrong.","A - Tony Huegel","That\u2019s correct, yes.","Q - David Raso","If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019re implying the Construction & Forestry margins in fourth quarter to go up from 8.4% this quarter to 10.3%. You\u2019re implying the segment profits to be at a level that does not collaborates a net income number to get the full-year to $1.8 billion, I mean, it\u2019s literally like $0.30 of EPS off, it\u2019s a difference between $0.65 implied to the fourth quarter versus roughly $0.95. So, I apologize but if you can please just for modeling here for the whole street going forward, can you help us understand that\u2019s not rounding?","If you stick with your Ag, and you go well, that the wiggles in Construction, it\u2019s the difference between saying C&F margins are 10% in the fourth quarter or break-even. So, please just indulge us, walk us through what are you really implying about segment margins for the fourth quarter or are you maybe sandbagging the net income implied to the fourth quarter. Just the math, it just doesn\u2019t make sense?","A - Tony Huegel","I\u2019m not following necessarily your math on, especially on C&F.","Q - David Raso","Tony, the math, am I wrong you\u2019re saying sales for the year at $6.252 billion right, that\u2019s 5% down, 10% margins are $625 million, that\u2019s a full year EBIT, we only have $464 million year-to-date, so you need profits of $161 million in the fourth quarter to get your full-year C&F. And on these revenues that\u2019s a 10.3% margin for the fourth quarter its, just the math?","A - Tony Huegel","If you do a full 10% and if that 10% was exactly 10.0%, I would agree with you. But as I said before, remember, when we say 10% that\u2019s anywhere from 9.5% to 10.4% round to\u2026","Q - David Raso","I don\u2019t mean to make this a math question, but the fourth quarter margin on C&F, even if you get anywhere near that rounding issue, it\u2019s implying a segment EBIT for the whole company well above what you\u2019re implying net income to be to the fourth quarter, I mean, it\u2019s a positive story, maybe it is cushion in the net income number and you think the segments do these numbers, and that\u2019s great.","So, I\u2019m not making a bullish or bearish comment here, I\u2019m just trying to make sure I understand that math doesn\u2019t make sense, it could wildly swing the C&F margin for the fourth quarter and thus influence people\u2019s thoughts on how they model C&F into \u201816? And if need to take it offline that\u2019s fine, but this is not rounding?","A - Tony Huegel","We will have to take it offline, but remember again as I said, this is both the margins are rounded. And so, again, just like we had with pricing there are times when you\u2019re rounding it can be more aggressive than other times.","So you have to take that into consideration as you\u2019re trying to reconcile down to where we are with our net income number. And so, beyond that there is really not much more I can say. When we follow-up later, we can certainly discuss this a bit more.","Q - David Raso","I appreciate it. And again, I apologize for the math. I just wanted to clarify. So thank you. We\u2019ll talk later.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Vishal Shah","Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. Tony, can you maybe comment on the extent of over capacity that you think is coming out of your oil patch and how long it will take to get some of that capacity to be absorbed and the headwinds to overcome? Thank you.","A - Raj Kalathur","I think from our perspective, our dealers tend to react pretty quickly when they see some of those changes in terms of their end demand. We are hearing, and again, as Susan pointed out in her comments, when you think about C&F, there is little bit of dichotomy because you talk to our contractors, our dealers, the sentiment is generally - fairly positive especially outside of those energy impacted areas.","The underlying fundamentals that we would normally point to are actually fairly positive year-over-year. We\u2019re just seeing a softness in orders. And certainly in energy is weaker year-over-year. You\u2019re hearing some, there is commentary about some of the independent rental companies for example shifting inventory out of those areas that are more energy dependent into the rest of the country. And that is in fairly large sizes, some large auctions and in places like Western Canada, in more recent months, so those sorts of things can have some impact.","So, again, we\u2019ll see as we move forward where this market ends up going. But both in current year as well as you look out into 2016, most of the indications from a general economic perspective would be relatively positive. But again, as I started to say, our dealers respond quickly with our order fulfillment process and the ability for them to replenish equipment very rapidly.","They tend to when there is uncertainty, they tend to pull-back quickly and adjust their inventories very rapidly which is exactly what we would hope to see. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve seen in the quarter as well as is those dealers making those adjustments quickly.","And with that, we\u2019ll go ahead with the next caller.","Operator","Next question is from Nicole DeBlase with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Nicole DeBlase","Yes, thanks good morning guys.","A - Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Q - Nicole DeBlase","I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but I\u2019m going to try to ask this in a really simple way. So, pricing you guys are now seeing 1% growth for the full year, my math suggests that that implies negative pricing in the fourth quarter, can you just confirm if you think pricing goes negative in 4Q or if it\u2019s just decelerating from what we\u2019ve seen in 2Q and 3Q?","A - Tony Huegel","Yes, our forecast would not be negative in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind as you think about that as I mentioned earlier, remember there is rounding in that number. So, even within some of the other prior quarters, third quarter for example, we were actually running much closely to that 1.5 points versus, even in our prior forecast when you saw the 2 points we were rounding up to that 2 points. Now we\u2019re rounding down to 1 point. And so, the implied change from last quarter to this quarter isn\u2019t a full point.","Q - Nicole DeBlase","Okay. That makes total sense, thanks for clarifying.","A - Tony Huegel","And just to clarify, both divisions while we don\u2019t talk about details by division, both divisions are forecasting positive price in the fourth quarter.","Q - Nicole DeBlase","Okay, thank you.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Joel Tiss with BMO Asset Management. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Joel Tiss","Hi, I just have one for Raj. I just wondered if you can talk to us why the free cash flow seemed so weak in the quarter or for the year-to-date given how much inventories are coming down?","A - Raj Kalathur","So, I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re saying it\u2019s weaker. The previous forecast for cash flow from operations was $3.4 billion, the current is about $3.2 billion, but $100 million should be explained by our net income in our guidance reduction from $1.9 billion to $1.8 billion, and the rest of that is essentially working capital. By the way the $3.2 billion, as we actually achieve would be I think the third best in recent history if not the third best ever.","Q - Joel Tiss","My question was about free cash flow though not operating and year-to-date it\u2019s about $800 million down from $1.5 billion last year. And so, with almost $1 billion of inventory coming out year-to-date I wondered why it looks like it\u2019s a lot lower than just the inventory reduction?","A - Raj Kalathur","I think we look at operating cash flow, if you look at - if you reduce the capital, the capital expenditures are actually, our forecast for capital expenditures, last quarter to this quarter has actually come down. So, I still am not adding up what you\u2019re adding up yet, so.","Q - Joel Tiss","Okay, all right.","A - Tony Huegel","We can take that offline too and talk about a little bit more detail, but yes, actually again, I think as you look for the year, we\u2019re certainly continuing to forecast we think very strong cash flow, down a little bit as receivables and inventory adjusted in the quarter versus prior guidance, is that adjusted in the quarter but still very healthy level of cash flow.","Okay, next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Seth Weber","Hi, good morning everybody.","A - Tony Huegel","Hello.","Q - Seth Weber","Hello, hi, can you hear me?","A - Tony Huegel","I can.","Q - Seth Weber","Great, thanks. So, the decremental margins in the Construction business, Construction & Forestry about 29%, it looks like you\u2019re forecasting something around 30% for the fourth quarter. If revenues are down next year, is the 30% decremental the right way to think about Construction & Forestry for next year? And maybe can you comment on mix that you\u2019re seeing there?","A - Tony Huegel","Yes, I think normally we would be, some of that can be mix driven to your point. And I think as you think about that decremental, especially in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter, keeping in mind some of that is caused by the rapid change in the environment. So, as you think about pulling some of the levers we would pull, those sorts of things, there are lead times on that.","So, if we would continue to see negative sales going into 2016, certainly that division would be looking at ways to improve the decremental sounds like an odd way to say it, but to see lower levels of decrementals.","Q - Seth Weber","Lower, relative to the 30%?","A - Tony Huegel","Yes.","Q - Seth Weber","Okay, thank you very much.","A - Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Ross Gilardi","Hi, good morning everybody.","A - Tony Huegel","Hi Ross.","Q - Ross Gilardi","I guess, I just want to ask you quickly about South America, and you\u2019ve taken your outlook down for Ag again. But I mean, the data that\u2019s come out year-to-date still feels like a lot worse than that outlook. So, what are you seeing there, I mean, is the data overall in both Ag and Construction in Brazil just feel terrible. And I know Deere\u2019s obviously bullish on the long-term. But any signs of stability at all, why down only 20% to 25%?","A - Tony Huegel","Well, first of all, I would keep one thing to keep in mind is as you\u2019re looking at year-to-date data out of Brazil, that\u2019s a calendar basis. And we would be looking at a fiscal basis, so we still have within our outlook for fiscal 2015 we still have November\/December of last year where those FINAME rates were still at very low levels relative to where they are today. And so I think that maybe some of the change in terms of what our outlook is versus maybe what you\u2019re seeing in the calendar year-to-date numbers.","Q - Ross Gilardi","Okay. Just can you comment at all? It was all, meant to be kind of wrapped up in one question, just your thoughts on stabilization at all there? It just doesn\u2019t feel like the data \u2013 it feel like the data is still in the process of getting worse not better?","A - Tony Huegel","Yes, I think it\u2019s FINAME financing I would argue has created some stabilization with the announcement earlier this year of rates really through next June of 2016. The funding seems to be appropriate, so they didn\u2019t increase it from where rates went to in April of this year. And so, there is some stability there of course, there is always risk that that can change.","And again, the funding that was announced is, we believe at a very appropriate level for the business, so that\u2019s one positive aspect. But I think FX creates certainly uncertainty in the environment, farmers there have benefited from the weakening of the real in this year as they sell their crops in U.S. dollars and they convert that back. It\u2019s actually kept their cash receipts and margins pretty favorable. But there is always the risk of when does that change and move back the other direction.","So, there is uncertainty there. And more importantly just around the general economy and that doesn\u2019t seem to be seeing much stabilization at this point. I\u2019d argue that\u2019s probably the biggest risk as we move next year.","Q - Ross Gilardi","Got it, thanks Tony.","A - Tony Huegel","Okay. Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question will be from Kwame Webb with Morningstar. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Kwame Webb","Good morning everyone.","A - Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Q - Kwame Webb","So, maybe just a little bit of a longer-term question, I know you guys have been doing a lot on the Telematics front, recent acquisition in Brazil. Can you just kind of talk about what are the product development priorities there? And then just any commentary on what if renewal rates been for products like JDLink once customers get beyond the trial period?","A - Tony Huegel","Yes, at this point we really haven\u2019t talked about any kind of renewal rate publicly and that sort of thing but clearly as we\u2019ve talked about longer term from intelligence in machinery that\u2019s a key focus that we continue to have especially around machine and job optimization functions.","From an R&D perspective I think we\u2019ve talked about as well, certainly increasing the amount that we\u2019re spending in that area today. What we spend on intelligence would be comparable to the type of R&D we would have on things like large tractors or combines. So it\u2019s certainly right up in parity.","With that and again just reflects the importance that we see of intelligence as we move forward. And we think we have a great opportunity to continue to provide efficiency to our customers through intelligence and believe that will be a way that we continue to differentiate as we move forward.","Q - Kwame Webb","Just, if you aren\u2019t willing to give like a hard number, maybe just some commentary on whether it\u2019s trended, renewal rates have been in-line, below or better than expectations?","A - Tony Huegel","Yes, that\u2019s just not something we\u2019ve commented on publicly. So we\u2019re going to have to move on to the final call. We have time for one more call. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question will be from Larry De Maria with William Blair & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Larry De Maria","Hi, thanks, hi Tony. I guess, not to go back and harp on the book order but if they\u2019re similar to last year, obviously that implies down double-digit, which means that large Ag probably is down like you said. I think you would hope for a flat demand next year and have inventory in shape, which would give you positive delta for next year.","So, I\u2019m just wondering where we stand now, do you think Deere and field inventory can get into relatively decent shape at year-end? And then therefore what kind of order of magnitude if not do we need in production cuts into next year do you think to kind of right-size things?","A - Tony Huegel","Right. First of all I want to be clear we did not have guidance on 2016. I think a lot of people implied some of our commentary to assume we were looking at flat for 2016. We were using that as an example, just like Raj earlier mentioned if it were down 10% what would our decremental margins be, I want to be clear we are not trying to signal down 10% for next year on all product lines, that\u2019s just an example.","And we similarly use that really to reflect the fact that as we under-produce this year, you don\u2019t need an increase in end-markets, retail sales to necessarily see an increase in Deere sales.","But clearly as you look at the early order programs, I want to be clear there as well. We\u2019re down year-over-year we\u2019re not talking about seeing the type of magnitude of decrease that we saw last year but certainly down directionally is what we\u2019re seeing in those early order programs at this point. So, in that regard we certainly have under-produced this year from a new inventory perspective.","Certainly we feel like, our inventories will be in good shape. But as I mentioned earlier in the call, we will have some additional challenges to work through next year on used equipment especially as it relates to large tractors. Beyond that there is not much more I can really say about 2016.","End of Q&A","Tony Huegel","So, we appreciate your call. But we\u2019re going to have to wrap up. Again, thank you for your participation. And we look forward to the call backs as we go through the rest of the day.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session of today's conference.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tony Huegel, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Hello. Also on the call today are Raj Kalathur, our Chief Financial Officer; and Susan Karlix, our Manager of Investor Communications.","Today, we'll take a closer look at Deere's second quarter earnings then spend some time talking about our markets and our outlook for the second half of fiscal 2015. After that, we'll respond to your questions.","Please note that slides are available to complement the call this morning. They can be accessed on our website at www.johndeere.com.","First, a reminder, this call is being broadcast live on the Internet and recorded for future transmission and use by Deere & Company.

Additional information concerning these measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, is included in the release and posted on our website at www.johndeere.com\/earnings under Other Financial Information.","Susan?","Susan Karlix - Manager, Investor Communications","John Deere announced second quarter earnings today. And in our view, the results were impressive in light of the weak conditions plaguing the global agricultural sector. Our performance reflected the skillful execution of our operating plans and the contributions of a well-rounded business lineup.","The company's Construction & Forestry and Financial Services businesses had higher results for the quarter, while our Agriculture & Turf operations remained solidly profitable despite lower demand for large models of farm machinery.","We also saw benefits from our success holding the line on costs and assets, a fact that gives our performance a measure of resilience we have not seen in prior downturns. Another item weighing on our results was the strong U.S. dollar. It continued to put pressure on reported sales made outside of the United States and is expected to continue doing so for the rest of the year.","Now let's take a closer look at the second quarter in detail, beginning on slide three. Net sales and revenues were down 18% to $8.171 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $690 million. This includes a $38 million after-tax gain associated with the previously announced sale of our crop insurance business. EPS was $2.03 in the quarter.","On slide four, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 20% to $7.4 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by two points. Currency translation was negative by five points.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on slide five. Sales were down 25% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in all regions of the world, but the decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes of large Ag equipment in the United States and Canada. Also hurting sales in the quarter was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange. Operating profit was $639 million. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was 31%, quite respectable considering the decrease in large Ag sales.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the Ag business. Slide six outlines U.S. farm cash receipts, which in spite of softer commodity prices, remain near historically high levels thanks to help from record livestock receipts. As a result, our 2014 forecast calls for cash receipts of about $418 billion, up about 1% from 2013, and the highest level ever recorded. Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and consequently the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 6%. Of note, crop receipts for 2015 are forecast to be about 23% lower than 2012's record.","On slide seven, global grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels, even after the abundant harvests of the past two years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong, while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tensions could lower production, reduce stocks-to-use ratio, and result in prices quickly moving higher.","Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on slide eight. Economic growth continues in the region, although at a slow pace. Grain prices appear to be stabilizing at levels near the long-term average. While livestock margins remain at good levels, dairy margins are being squeezed. As a result, farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be lower for the year.","On slide nine, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In China, the government continues its investment in Ag equipment subsidies, but the growth rate has slowed. This as well as the continued slowdown in economic growth and lower commodity prices has led to a decrease in forecast industry sales.","Turning to India, the 2015 monsoon season rainfall is expected to be below normal. That on top of last year's relatively dry monsoon season will result in lower overall agriculture output. In the CIS, continued deterioration of economic growth and further tightening of credit continued to weigh on equipment sales. Notably, western equipment manufacturers are being heavily impacted by the weak Russian currency and geopolitical uncertainties.","Shifting to Brazil, slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness. Ag production is expected to decrease about 11% for the year in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. However, with the weak real, the value of production is much more attractive in the local currency, as the price for which farmers sell crops is set in U.S. dollars, but paid in Brazilian real. Even with the recent drop in prices, Ag fundamentals remain positive for grains. On balance, though, farmer confidence in Brazil is lower as a result of economic uncertainty and political concerns in the country, leading to lower equipment purchases.","Slide 11 illustrates eligible finance rates for Ag equipment in Brazil. Eligible finance rates for Ag equipment through the end of June increased 3% in April to 7.5% and 9%, depending on a farmer's revenues, with no change on the required down payment. Uncertainty over the 2015 \u2013 2016 Ag budget as well as concerns about possible further increases in interest rates are also weighing on farmer confidence.","Our 2015 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on slide 12. Lower commodity prices and falling farm income are putting pressure on demand for farm equipment, especially larger models. At the same time, conditions in the livestock sector are positive, providing support to sales of small and mid-sized tractors. As we refine our forecast of market conditions, we now expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 25% for 2015.","The EU 28 industry outlook is down about 10%, unchanged from last quarter, due to lower crop prices and farm income, as well as pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 15% to 20% in 2015. The decline in our outlook is a result of economic uncertainty in Brazil, the questions surrounding government-sponsored financing noted previously, and potential currency movements.","Shifting to Asia, we now expect sales to be down modestly. In the CIS, we continue to expect industry sales to be down significantly, due to economic concerns, limited credit availability and the weak ruble. Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2015, no change from our prior forecast.","Putting this all together on slide 13, fiscal year 2015 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 24%, including about five points of negative currency translation. The one point change in the forecast from last quarter is all attributable to the impact of foreign currency exchange. The Ag & Turf division operating margin is now forecast to be about 8%.","Before turning to Construction & Forestry, let's take a look at our all-new 8000 Series Self-Propelled Forage Harvester on slide 14. After 20 years of incremental changes to our SPFH product line, it represents a complete update with a total of 5,500 new part numbers. The new machine addresses the needs of livestock and dairy customers, as well as biogas producers for higher efficiency and productivity. It offers innovative features such as field guidance, products, and smart unloading systems, as well as a new cab, which combine to increase performance and up time and decrease the cost of ownership, while adding comfort for the operator.","Earlier this year, the 8000 Series won the 2015 Forage Harvester Machine of the Year at SIMA, the Paris International Agri Business Show. The 8000 Series Forage Harvester added to our lineup of self-propelled windrowers. And our recent entry into the large square baler business better positions Deere within the hay and forage market.","Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on slide 15. Net sales were up 2% in the quarter and operating profit was up 43%. The division's incremental margin was about 173%.","Moving to slide 16, looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, the economy continues to move forward. GDP growth is improving, unemployment is falling, construction hiring is on the increase, and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units this year.","In contrast, we are seeing weakening conditions in the energy sector and energy producing regions. Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be up about 2% in 2015. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about three points. The change in our forecast from last quarter is due to lower sales outside the U.S. and Canada, as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange. Global forestry markets are expected to be about flat on the heels of a 10% increase in 2014. C&F's full year operating margin is projected to be about 11%.","Before moving to financial services, the first Deere-designed and built production-class dozer is shown on slide 17. The model 1050K is the largest crawler dozer John Deere has ever produced and is part of our growing production-class equipment portfolio. It was introduced earlier this year for mass earthmoving and quarry operations. Its dual-path, hydrostatic transmission, a unique feature to this size class, provides better fuel economy and maneuverability. Other improvements include a higher power-to-weight ratio, which provides more pushing power and more turning power with full loads. In addition, the 1050K crawler is equipped with John Deere WorkSight telematics to allow technicians to connect to the machines wirelessly, reducing the repair cycle time, the overall cost of repair and customer downtime.","Let's move now to our financial services operations. Slide 18 shows that the financial services annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio was eight basis points at the end of April. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2015 now contemplates a loss provision of about 14 basis points versus nine basis points in 2014. The year-over-year increase is a reflection of the unsustainably low loss level of the last four years. For reference, the 10-year average is 26 basis points and the 15-year average is 43 points.","Moving to slide 19, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $170 million in the second quarter versus $148 million last year. Net proceeds from the sale of the crop insurance business benefited the division's second quarter income by about $27 million after-tax. Earlier, I mentioned a $38 million enterprise gain on the sale. The difference is largely due to the enterprise utilization of capital loss carry-forwards not originating at the financial services division level. 2015 net income attributable to Deere & Company is forecast at about $630 million, no change from our previous forecast.","Slide 20 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $1.6 billion. That was equal to 31.4% of prior 12-month sales compared with 32.1% a year ago. The decrease, which came entirely from Ag & Turf, is reflective of the aggressive way we have cut production in line with our 2015 outlook. We expect to end the year with total receivables and inventories down about $600 million. The decrease in the Ag division from prior guidance is due to reductions outside the United States and Canada and foreign currency exchange.","Our 2015 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales, shown on slide 21, is about 78%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2015, keep these factors in mind: price realizations of about two points; favorable raw material costs; an unfavorable mix of product; and Tier 4 product costs. Looking at R&D expense on slide 22, R&D was down about 4% in the second quarter, including about three points of negative currency translation. Our 2015 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1% for the full year, including about three points of negative currency translation. The forecast reflects higher R&D spending in the second half of the year which is the typical pattern.","Moving now to slide 23, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down about 14% in the second quarter, including about four points of currency translation. Our 2015 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 11% with landscapes, water, and currency accounting for about six points of the change. Similar to the situation with R&D spending, SA&G expense is forecast to be higher in the second half of the year.","Turning to slide 24, pension and OPEB expense was up about $15 million in the quarter and is forecast to be up about $70 million in 2015.","On slide 25, the equipment operations tax rate was approximately 30% in the quarter, primarily due to mix of income and discrete items. For the remainder of fiscal 2015, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.","Slide 26 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $3.4 billion in 2015.","The company's third quarter financial outlook is on slide 27. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 17% compared with 2014. This includes about two points of price realization with unfavorable currency translation of about six points.","Turning to slide 28 and the full-year outlook, the forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 19%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about two points. Currency translation is negative about four points. Finally, despite strong currency headwinds, our full-year 2015 net income forecast is now about $1.9 billion, an increase from our previous guidance.","In closing, John Deere expects to be solidly profitable in 2015. In fact, the year is forecast to rank among our stronger ones in sales and profits, even with the pullback we're experiencing in the farm sector. Such an achievement says a lot about the progress we've made establishing a wider range of revenue sources and a more durable business model. All in all, we remain confident in the company's present direction and in its ability to meet customer needs for advanced machinery and services in the future.","I'll now turn the call back over to Tony.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Susan. Now we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. But as a reminder, in considerations of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate on the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. David?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question today comes from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is open.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe we should start with about how you see the inventory levels at the dealers and what you see in the used equipment pricing market.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","So as you think about used equipment, obviously, overall I assume you're referring mostly to large Ag equipment. So, as you...","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's right.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","So as you look at dealer inventory, certainly we took \u2013 last year, again as a reminder, we pulled a lot of inventory out. As Susan pointed out in the opening comments, we're down pretty significantly year over year. As we ended the quarter this year with receivables and inventory, we're down almost $2 billion year over year for Ag & Turf.","And certainly there's a lot of conversation about used equipment levels as well. And we would tell you, as you look at large Ag in total, certainly, we're always concerned about used equipment. If you ask us are we more concerned today than we were three months ago or six months ago, the answer would be no. We continue to be very focused on that. We believe we're materially in better position than our competition. But we're really focusing on lowering those used inventory levels, but also protecting resale values as we do that. So we believe we're on the right path. We feel pretty good about the direction we're heading with used equipment, but certainly we have a lot of work ahead of us in terms of continuing to pull that down.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's helpful, and just one other question.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Actually, I'm sorry.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you maybe talk about what percentage of...","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","I'm going to have to ask you to get back in the queue. I'm sorry.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sure.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Next caller?","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Good morning.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","A quick question on the modest improvement in the U.S. and Canada outlook. Is that all driven by lower horsepower, or are you seeing better order intake than previously expected in the high horsepower equipment sector?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","I would not characterize that as a significant improvement, really, in any of our businesses. I would argue it's a bit of a tweaking, as Susan pointed out, refining the forecast. But certainly, we have not changed our outlook on large Ag business. We're continuing to see that down closer to the 40% range in the industry, and so not a significant change really anywhere, but certainly not with large Ag.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Okay. Thank you, next caller?","Operator","Your next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, good morning.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Good morning.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Tony, can you talk about the raw material benefit that you folks saw in the quarter and what's factored into guidance? And then can you calibrate us on the transactional impact of currency along those lines as well, please?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Okay, so I'll take the first question. If we want to talk about currency, we'll have to someone get back in, either get back in queue or we'll have someone else pick up on that. As you know, we don't disclose specific guidance in terms of dollar impact from raw materials. A couple years ago now, we switched and started providing guidance on overall cost of sales. But certainly, that has been a benefit in the first half of the year. I would tell you as you look at the second half of the year, certainly for Ag & Turf, but really on the overall business, it's slightly less benefit in the back half of the year.","Now before anyone gets too excited about that, it's not that we're implying that steel costs and other commodity costs necessarily go up. If you think about the timing of our general purchases and our production on any year, we tend to build inventory in the first half of the year sequentially, and then it comes down in the back half. So you tend to get the benefit earlier in the year in some of those material costs. So continued benefit from material costs year over year, but if you're looking first half, second half, there is actually a slight difference, a slightly lower benefit in the back half in our implied guidance. Okay.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, next caller?","Operator","Your next question comes from Mig Dobre of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, everyone.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Good morning.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Tony, can you maybe range us in terms of your expectations for full-year margins in construction versus Ag & Turf?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","So if you look at the margin, I think Susan pointed out on the call, we are looking for C&F margins to be about 11%. For the full year, Ag & Turf would be about 8%. So no change on C&F from our prior forecast, a slight increase actually for Ag & Turf; we had previously forecasted about 7%.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, next caller?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Raso of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Thank you. Given your new inventory and receivable forecast, where do you see production versus retail heading into 2016? And if you can break it out between Ag & Turf and Construction & Forestry, because obviously, I assume that must have been baked into why you altered some of the receivable and inventory forecasts?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","As you look at receivables and inventory, and specifically we'll start with Ag & Turf, as you look at the change in the forecast from last quarter to this quarter, I would tell you it really \u2013 it does not relate to the U.S. and Canada. It relates to receivables and \u2013 both receivables and inventory outside of the U.S. and Canada as well as some FX impact quarter over quarter. But it's mostly about those receivables outside of the U.S. and Canada. But it's implied already and not to be forgotten that we pulled a lot of receivables and inventory out in 2014 as we ended the year, and certainly in our initial \u2013 in our original budget guidance, we had a pretty healthy level of receivables and inventory continuing to come out on Ag & Turf as we seek to under-produce the retail environment through the year.","So we have under-produced year-to-date and we would continue, especially as we go into the back half of the year, we'll be under-producing the retail environment and continuing to bring those field inventories down, both on new as well as providing some additional support that way for our dealers on used equipment. When you think about C&F, remember we talked about it early on, much of that increase and some of that is because of higher sales, of course, so I don't want to imply there isn't any increase in field inventories. But much of that has to do with the change in some of the terms, and we think that will drive some higher levels of receivables. And really the reduction you saw in the quarter had more to do with a refinement of what we think that impact will be from those terms changes versus really any kind of significant expectation in terms of a change in actual field inventories. So that's really what's driving most of that as we look towards the end of the year.","David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","But to my question, just so I'm clear on the takeaway, is this forecast to set you up going into 2016 that whatever we think retail will be, you expect to produce in line with retail?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Our expectation for 2015 is certainly to produce under with the hope that in 2016 we will be able to produce to retail next year. Now again, that's making a lot of assumptions on what 2016 would be as well. But what I don't want to imply is that, as you look at that reduction in receivables and inventory, that there is any kind of signaling of what 2016 may or may not be because, again, that change was not related to the U.S. and Canada.","David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","I totally understand. I just want to make sure the spirit of that forecast is to set you up into 2016 where there isn't necessarily more inventory reduction. The spirit is to enter 2016.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","That has been our expectation all year and that has not changed so.","David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Thank you so much, I appreciate it.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, next caller?","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Fisher of UBS Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Steven M. Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Bigger picture on Ag, we're still seeing most Ag markets down around the world. But looking forward, give us your sense for which Ag market you think has the best potential to turn positive first and why.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","That's a great \u2013 a tough question at this point. And actually I think if you look at the U.S. and Canada markets, for example, and I think it really implies the overall commodity market in general, if you talk to our Chief Economist, he would tell you we're really in kind of a year-to-year type of mode right now. And as frustrating as it may be for people to hear, it really is about what happens this summer with the current crop that's in the ground. If you're going to assume another year of better than average weather, where yields are above trend yield, then certainly it's going to be a challenging argument to make that 2016 would certainly improve really anywhere around the globe.","If you look back at what would the implications be of trend yields or a little less than ideal weather or average weather and you see below trend yield, then that story changes pretty dramatically because we would argue that you're not \u2013 while you certainly have ample supply of commodities and you're seeing that reflected in commodity prices, there isn't a glut of commodities either. And so if you under-produce demand going into \u2013 through the 2015 crop and going into 2016, we believe prices will be very responsive to that and cash receipts would recover in that type of environment, you would see sales begin to recover as well. But that's as close to \u2013 and I can't pinpoint a certain geography, specifically, but I would say that's probably a pretty consistent global statement that we would make, okay.","Steven M. Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, next caller?","Operator","Next question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, good morning. I guess can you just comment on the order book where we stand today versus expectations and where we were last year by combines and 7R, 8R or 9R, et cetera? Thanks.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","You bet. As you think about order book, I think in general we would continue to say, versus our forecast \u2013 obviously, we're forecasting a much lower level of orders, but versus that forecast, we continue to be in very, very good shape compared to last year in terms of the order coverage. And certainly combines at this point in the year with the early order program we're well over 90% covered and the bigger question tends to be things like large tractors. If you think about 7000 Series tractors, today we would be \u2013 really 7000s, 8000s, and 9000s for this year we're out into early October in terms of availability and these are the wheel tractors, not track tractors so across the board on wheel tractors we'd be early October. Last year, on 7000s, that would have been late August. 8000s would have also been early October, so consistent. And on 9000s, it would have been mid-June...","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","...in terms of availability. So our order book is actually \u2013 on, again, much lower order level, our much \u2013 expectations, but as an availability perspective in very good shape. I didn't mention the track tractors. Those would also be on 8000s would be out into early October. 9000s would be in August, which would be a little bit behind where we were last year. Last year, we would have been out into September.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right, great. Thank you for the color.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, next caller?","Operator","Next question comes from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, hi. Good morning.","Susan Karlix - Manager, Investor Communications","Hi, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just a clarification first, if I can. Just on David Raso's question. Your point is that until we get through July and August, July and August make or break the crop, until we get through those months we really cannot even begin to forecast what 2016 might look like. I think you would agree with that.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Yes.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then my real question is if you look at this whole trend in the industry towards leasing, can you talk about the increase in your equipment leasing? It was up about $1 billion, about 31% year over year, talk about the risks of \u2013 on residual values, when those leases expire and why this trend towards leasing versus selling?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Sure, that's a great question. Certainly you're right, we are seeing a move towards more leasing. We think some of that has to do with giving some of the lower margins customers are facing. And as well as \u2013 so again, when you purchase the equipment, you tend to get a better advantage from a tax deduction perspective. So as margins are a bit lower that isn't as attractive always, but then there's also questions around Section 179 and bonus depreciation. Will we really have that or not? And so we think that's factoring into some of those decisions in terms of a move towards leasing.","Really as we look at it, the key here is making sure that residuals \u2013 and I think as you imply, making sure that residuals are valued properly. And that tends be what we focus on, as you know. We tend to be relatively conservative on the setting of residual values. We continue to do that. Today, we certainly evaluate those on a regular basis. We haven't had any kind of write-downs or accruals that we've had to make against the residual values of that leasing portfolio. But that's really where the risk is. It does move some risk to the financial services organization in the sense of if residuals would drop dramatically as they come off of lease that could create some challenges there.","Couple things I would point out, though, related to that is, one, while it's increasing it's still a relatively small part of our total portfolio. So just to keep that in perspective. And the other thing is, and it's one of the reasons why it's so important for us as we manage used inventories in general to make sure we're protective of the \u2013 of pricing on that used equipment. Not only does it help \u2013 the value of that used equipment. So it helps certainly our dealers. So it's supportive there. But it's also supportive of the financial services organization in the sense of making sure we're protecting those residual values as we go through this downturn and as we continue to focus on moving those used equipment levels lower. So it is a balancing act in terms of looking to reduce those and still being protective of those values. So anyway, thank you. And we'll move onto the next caller.","Operator","Next question comes from Ross Gilardi of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, thanks. Good morning.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Hi, Ross.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Brazil, Tony. I mean, soybean fundamentals seemed pretty poor. You've cut your price outlook there. The borrowing rates were up sharply. You tweaked your outlook a little bit more negative but it doesn't seem like anything major. So does the situation feel like it's still in the process of deteriorating, or are you seeing any signs of stabilization at the bottom?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","As you think about Brazil on the Ag side, it's an interesting situation this year with the outlook that we have in place. Because if you look at \u2013 I would actually turn around a little bit with the soybean prices while in U.S. dollars certainly it's down, and consider the impact of currency. Because remember Brazilian farmers sell in U.S. dollars and then convert back to local currency. So their cash receipts in local currency and their margins, because most of their inputs were purchased in local currency. And to the extent that they were purchased in U.S. dollars, it would have been before the currency shifted last fall. And so when you look at margins on the crop that was recently harvested, they're pretty attractive levels, which is in stark contrast to the outlook.","Really what we're seeing in our outlook is, in our view, a concern around the general economy in Brazil. Some of the \u2013 you're seeing that in some of the increased rates of FINAME financing. So I would tell you much of that is going to be dependent on what happens as we move forward with that Brazilian economy. There's still some question. You'll note our slides end in June in terms of what the FINAME financing rates are because they haven't been announced beyond that. So we'll be hearing hopefully in early June is the expectation now, not just what the FINAME financing rates will be for both PSI and Moderfrota, but also what down payment levels they're going to require. Will they keep Moderfrota at the 10%? And as importantly, what's the overall budget? Will they change that overall budget? And then we'll have a much better feel for what happens as we move forward with Brazil, at least in the short term.","But again, I'd remind you this is about as short of a cycle. Longer term, we continue to believe that we have great opportunity in Brazil as agricultural output continues to grow, as acreage continues to grow, and certainly as our market share continues to grow, Okay, next caller?","Operator","Your next question comes from Eli Lustgarten of Longbow Research. Please go ahead with your questions.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning, everyone. Brilliant quarter, actually. Can we talk a little bit about the change in construction equipment, the lower sales and outlook and what you're seeing in the marketplace? I mean 2% is obviously a little disappointing type of gain in currency. But what are you seeing in the marketplace with the impact of oil and gas, and are we basically looking at a flattish environment for you guys for a while?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","I think it's important to point out and remind you, as Susan pointed out I guess in her comments, that the reduction really is not related to the U.S. and Canada. It's more about sales outside of the U.S. and Canada as well as FX. Within the U.S. and Canada, certainly we're seeing in those areas that are heavily influenced by energy, certainly seeing lower orders and business slowing down somewhat, but the overall market continues to be fairly attractive in terms of what we saw at the beginning of the year as well, again, as a reminder, coming off of a very strong 2014. So as you see those growth rates slow as we go into the back half of the year, remember we move into much tougher compares in that division.","But when you look at markets like Brazil, and I just mentioned that in my last commentary on the Ag sector, and I would say certainly the overall business there is down significantly. While we have our new facilities and we continue to look for market share increases in Brazil as we go through 2015, those market share increases just are not going to offset the impact of the overall reduction in the industry. And so again, those are some of the \u2013 it's probably the major reduction quarter over quarter is what our expectation is in Brazil. But a variety of overseas locations really have weakened, in our view, over the quarter. So that's primarily what's driving that difference.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","But you'll able to hold profitability if you...","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Profitability has not \u2013 as you look at that, profitability has not changed. We're still forecasting the same 11% margins, so. Okay?","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","All right, thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Let's move on to the next caller. Thank you, Eli.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nicole DeBlase of Morgan Stanley Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Good morning.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So my question is around the competitive environment. I guess what are you guys seeing on the pricing front out there, both with respect to new and used equipment? I think Vishal asked the question, but I'm not sure if that part of it got answered. And then not just Ag, but also if you're seeing any increase in competitive pricing within construction.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Yes, so competitive pressure certainly, we talked about that with the Ag & Turf division, and it's not a surprise given the level of inventories that our competition has. And as a reminder, we went into the year on large Ag, as you look at inventory as a percent of sales, about half of where our competition was. We would continue to say on large Ag equipment that our inventory levels are, as a percent of sales, about half of what the rest of the industry would be. But certainly that puts pressure because those inventories need to come down, and so you do see some pricing pressure. There's a variety of methods that they may choose to use to do that.","And certainly, we continue to see that \u2013 we talked about it last year in Construction & Forestry, both on our dealer sales as well as with the independent rental business, a lot of pricing pressure. And I would certainly tell you, year over year, that pricing pressure has not reduced. Now we still continue to forecast, even in that environment, a two point price realization. That's for the enterprise, but I would tell you both divisions are contributing to that, both Ag and Construction. And so while it's a tough environment, we continue to focus on bringing value to customers and enable us to get some of that price realization.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, next caller?","Operator","Next question comes from Rob Wertheimer of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","Rob C. Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good morning.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Hi, Rob.","Rob C. Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I'm trying to understand North American row crop inventory, and I totally get that the industry is twice as high as you, I do. But industry dealer inventory I think in units, is up year over year. I think your dealers were up year over year in units for row crops specifically. And sales I think at retail are down like 20%s. I'm just trying to understand. Why isn't your inventory down? Forgetting the industry is worse, why isn't your inventory down because I thought everything was matched to a farmer? So maybe there's just a pulse I'm not understanding or something like that. And then how do you get to the down 40% if it seems like you're down 20% or less for the first six months?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","So as you think about row crop tractors, I think the first thing to keep in mind is the data that's made public is 100 horsepower and above for AEM data. And we would view in terms of row crop tractors that breakdown to be more 180 horsepower to 200 horsepower and above.","So when you look at the AEM data, it gets clouded because you have our 6000 Series tractors in those numbers. You have some of our 5000 Series tractors in those numbers. And certainly those are tied much more closely to the livestock industry. We've talked about year over year seeing some strength in livestock, and so that does cloud that picture. And I would point out those 6000 Series tractors come from Germany. And so while we talk about building to retail order, that is on large Ag, so that would be our 7000s, 8000s and 9000s and that certainly is the case on those. So I think that's part of what is causing maybe some of the confusion.","The other thing to keep in mind, too, is what's reported in AEM is what inventory the dealer owns at the end of the quarter \u2013 or at the end of the month. And so you do get some distortion. Not all of that is inventory or stock at the dealer. You can have retail sold inventory or tractors that are marked as retail sold pounded in those numbers. So from the day it ships from our factory until it's delivered to the customer, it does get reported as dealer inventory. So again, that can distort things.","And I'd also caution any time, and we've talked about this for years, to be very careful about looking at any single month. And especially this year, as you look at year-over-year comparisons through the second quarter, remember last year our 7000 Series tractors and 8000 Series tractors were converting to Final Tier 4. And so you had different levels of inventory as you prepared for that transition and certainly as you came out of that transition. So it can distort the year-over-year comparison. So we would continue to tell you from a new inventory level perspective, we're quite comfortable in large Ag. We continue to have the lowest levels in the industry. And that's not expected to change as we go through the year. Now again that being said, as we talked about earlier, we are under-producing retail which we think will help lower inventories even further as we go through the year.","Rajesh Kalathur - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Rob. This is Raj. Let me add a couple points, okay. So if you just step back think of the industry environment we are facing and what we have done with respect to new and used inventories, we're facing, as you know, the deepest downturn in North American large Ag equipment industry in 25 years. And as Tony mentioned, we've been working on both used and new. Now, on used combine volumes, our position today is less than where our used combine volumes were a year from now \u2013 a year before and two years before. Okay? So we have confidence that we will work down our row crop used inventory as well.","And as for the new row crop equipment sold to the corn and soybean producers in the U.S. and Canada, if you take the 7000 Series and 8000 Series tractors in the first half of this year, our shipments in the U.S. and Canada came down with the decline in retail and a lot further as well. We actually under-shipped retail sales by over 20% in the first half. We are forecasted to under-ship retail for the second half as well. So the point I'm trying to make is we are managing our inventories aggressively while at the same time, and as Tony mentioned, keeping the long-term in mind. So thanks for the question.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Next caller?","Rob C. Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Next question comes from Mike Shlisky of Global Hunter Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Shlisky - Global Hunter Securities, LLC","Good morning, guys. I wanted to touch on Brazil as well, especially on your combine shipments. Some of the data coming out is showing that your shipments were actually down quite a bit in the second quarter here. But I was wondering if you could maybe comment on your company's retail sales versus shipments in Brazil and whether it's in line with your expectations for the quarter?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah, that's a good point. When you think about the information that's available publicly in Brazil, as a reminder, that is shipments not retail sales. While we certainly have continued to push for the industry to move to retail sales, others in the industry haven't been supportive of that change. And so it can distort things. We would tell you that certainly, from a retail sales perspective, things are moving forward as we would expect. We continue to take market share. It's showing, I think, even in the shipment numbers that certainly from a retail sales perspective our market shares continue to grow in Brazil, especially on tractors. And so we feel pretty comfortable with where we're at on inventories as well as the retail sales from a market share perspective in Brazil. Okay?","Michael Shlisky - Global Hunter Securities, LLC","Great. Thanks, Tony.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Emily G. McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning.

Can you hear me?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Yes, I can.","Emily G. McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I just wanted to see if you guys had any update to some of the countries in Europe are any better or worse than what you were thinking three months ago?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","I think probably as you look at Europe from \u2013 maybe the most noteworthy thing is you're starting to see at least some glimmers of hope from just a general economy perspective in some countries. But if you look at the Ag industry, we didn't change the overall outlook, and, I would say, from a country by country perspective, really not any kind of significant changes. It's a year that's really moving forward fairly consistently with what we had anticipated early on. So again, just not really much noteworthy in terms of a year-over-year change.","Emily G. McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Okay. Thanks. Next caller?","Operator","Next question comes from Larry De Maria of William Blair & Co. Please go ahead with your question.","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. Good morning. Just curious, you guys have talked a lot about myjohndeere.com and JDLink over the last couple years. How did the myjohndeere.com platform do this planting season? Have they been collecting data from farmers? Are they using it or blocking the data collection? And related to that, how did the new high speed planter do this year into planting season versus expectations? Thanks.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah, unfortunately I'll have to take \u2013 I'll take the first question. And as you think about the myjohndeere.com, certainly it is being used. Things have gone well with that from our perspective. Obviously, we continue to work with our customers to improve that process, but it is online and it is gathering data. And I think it's mostly being used, obviously, to gather prescription information and download into the machines given that it's more planting season. And certainly, we'll use that. I would expect customers to use that on the back half of the year as they gather harvesting information as well. So again we think it's off to a good start and feel pretty confident that that's going be a real value enhancer for our customers as we move forward.","Rajesh Kalathur - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Larry. This is Raj. I would also add that we watch the metrics on myjohndeere.com, the number of crop acres and a number of other things like that. So far it is actually \u2013 we're very encouraged by the results that we're seeing, okay?","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Can you put some numbers to that in terms of acreage that's been used on...","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","We at this point have not disclosed any kind of acreage that's covered or anything along that line, so. Okay, next caller?","Operator","Next question comes from Brian Sponheimer of Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian C. Sponheimer - G.research, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Hi, Brian. Sure.","Brian C. Sponheimer - G.research, Inc.","Just one clarification on the guidance. It's inclusive of the gain on the landscapes business, right?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","On...","Brian C. Sponheimer - G.research, Inc.","The net income increase is inclusive on the gain on the sale?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","On the sale of the insurance.","Brian C.

Yes.","Rajesh Kalathur - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Crop insurance.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","The crop insurance.","Brian C. Sponheimer - G.research, Inc.","Crop insurance, rather.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Yes. Yes, it is.","Brian C. Sponheimer - G.research, Inc.","And I'm just curious about from a planning, what type of weather is really kind of the 50% base point...","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Brian, I would \u2013 Brian...","Brian C. Sponheimer - G.research, Inc.","...for how you do your planning? And what's the plus, minus, and what will constitute a good year or a bad year as it relates to how you see the next six to 12 months shaping up?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","First of all, I want to make sure I point out, by the way that gain was implied in our forecast last quarter as well for the year.","Brian C. Sponheimer - G.research, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","And so that wasn't necessarily a full change as we go into the rest of the year. So the other thing I \u2013 at this point, you assume average weather. You assume trend yields until you get data that can potentially change that. And so we would continue to use trend yields in our internal forecasting at this point, recognizing that you can certainly see variation from that. We'll start adjusting that as we go through the summer and see weather develop, so. Okay?","Brian C. Sponheimer - G.research, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Tony.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Yep. Thank you. The next call \u2013 our next question will have to be the last question we can take for the call, so.","Operator","And your last question today comes from Brett Wong of Piper Jaffray & Co. Please go ahead with your question.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thanks for fitting me in here at the end, Tony. I appreciate it.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","You bet.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","I'm just wondering. I understand there's a lot of uncertainty around what 2016 will look like, and if we do have a strong crop this year pressuring a potential recovery, what other levers can you pull in order to kind of support margins?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Certainly, we would continue to look at from a cash perspective. Our CapEx would be one area we'd continue to look at, although we did pull that down quite a bit. You continue to look at options with SA&G and R&D. We talked about, when C&F went through their super-trough in 2009; when you get into levels that you didn't anticipate you tend to also find levers that you didn't necessarily anticipate. And depending on the perspective, we kept R&D pretty flat year over year in our outlook, and so that would be something you would continue to look at.","And that's \u2013 as we've said all along, that's something you balance in terms of long-term need. That wouldn't be necessarily a desirable lever, but you \u2013 we would continue to look at those things that we could pull out as we go through the year. But it would \u2013 I would also point out if you see a large incremental drop, that creates challenges given where our capacity, where our facilities are at today in terms of percent of capacity utilization.","And so, but again, we certainly \u2013 as we look at the outlook for next year, unless you're going to argue for better than average weather, it's hard to argue that you're going to see a significant drop in commodity prices given the strength in demand that we continue to see on commodities. So that would be one area I would make sure to remind people, so.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Okay, with that, we will conclude the call. And I think it's important maybe to step back a little bit, too, and think about the year that we're forecasting. As you look at our guidance for 2015 and put that in perspective, in a historical perspective, as you look at what we're forecasting for equipment operations net sales, as you look at what we're forecasting for cash flow from operations in equipment operations, as well as our EPS overall, it puts us in a top five year in all three of those categories in terms of what this guidance provides. And when you put that in context of where our largest business, where the end markets went this year in terms of the significant drop, we think that's really demonstrating again the power of the overall portfolio, the strength of that SVA model and our ability to continue to drive very solid earnings even in lower end markets.","With that, we'll be around for the rest of the day to take any additional questions you may have.

Thank you. You may begin.","Tony Huegel","Thanks, Laura. Hello. Also on the call today are Raj Kalathur, our Chief Financial Officer; and Susan Karlix, our Manager of Investor Communications.","Today we'll take a closer look at Deere's fourth quarter earnings, then spend some time talking about our markets and our initial outlook for fiscal 2015. After that we'll respond to your questions. Please note that slides are available to complement the call this morning. They can be accessed on our website at www.johndeere.com.","First, a reminder.

Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in the company's most recent Form 8-K and periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call also may include financial measures that are not in conformance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America or GAAP. Additional information concerning these measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, is included in the release and posted on our website at www.johndeere.com\/financialreports under Other Financial Information. Susan?","Susan Karlix","Thank you, Tony. With today's announcement of our fourth quarter results, John Deere completed another year of solid performance. We did so in spite of weaker conditions in the global farm sector, particularly in the sale of large farm machinery. In response to this situation, we moved aggressively. We re-streamed costs. We reduced assets. And we realized the benefit of having a broad-based business lineup.","As a result, Deere was able to deliver strong results, including our second best year ever in terms of net income. We also maintained our sound financial condition, generated healthy levels of cash flow and returned some $3.5 billion to investors in dividends and share repurchases. All in all, it was another good year, one in which the company further demonstrated its commitment to disciplined operations and the resilience of its business model.","Now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter in detail beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 5% to $8.965 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $649 million. EPS was $1.83 in the quarter.","On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 7% to $8 billion. In the quarter-over-quarter comparison of net sales, Landscapes and Water accounted for 4 points of the change. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 1 point. Currency translation was a negative 1 point.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Sales were down 13%, primarily due to lower shipment volumes of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada. Operating profit was $682 million. In addition to volume, margins in the quarter were negatively impacted by lower production in our factories. Output hours in the large ag equipment factories were down, depending on the factory, anywhere from 35% to 55%.","This illustrates the aggressive manner in which we stepped on the brakes during the quarter to allowing production with reduced order volumes. Product mix, product costs primarily related to engine emission regulations, warranty costs and an impairment charge for our China operations were other factors impacting margins in the quarter.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines US farm cash receipts which in spite of lower grain prices remained at historically high levels, thanks to help from record livestock receipts. As a result, our forecast calls for 2014 cash receipts to be about $413 billion, up about 1% from 2013, which would be the highest level ever recorded.","Given the record grain yield of 2014 and lower commodity prices going forward, our forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 5% in 2015. Of note, although livestock receipts remain at high levels, crop receipts for 2015 are forecast to be down about 17% lower than 2012 crop receipt record.","On Slide 7, global grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels even after abundant harvest. Global grain and oil seed demand remains strong, while supplies appear to be adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tensions could lower production, reduce the stocks-to-use ratio and result in prices quickly moving higher.","Our economic outlook for the EU28 is on Slide 8. Economic growth continues in the region, albeit at a slow pace. With feed costs easing, beef prices strong and milk prices at good levels, margins remain supportive for livestock and dairy farmers. However, grain prices have declined and dairy margins are expected to tighten, resulting in a decrease in 2015 farm income. As a result, farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be lower for the year.","On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In the CIS, declining economic growth and further tightening of credit availability continue to weigh on equipment sales. Notably, western equipment manufacturers are being heavily impacted by geopolitical uncertainties.","In China, economic growth is slower than expected. The Chinese government continues to increase its investment in ag equipment subsidies, but the growth rate has slowed. This among other things has led to a decrease in industry sales. Turning to India, positive sentiments surrounding the new government continues. However, the monsoon season rainfall was below normal, which could result in lower overall agriculture output.","Slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agri business in Brazil. The information on this slide has changed from what we have presented in the past. Crops included in the value of ag production are now more closely aligned to those that have the largest impact on our business, namely soybeans, sugar, corn, ethanol, cotton, rice and wheat. We are no longer including crops like coffee and fruits.","Additionally, we are now showing the value of ag production in US dollars rather than the local currency. Ag production is expected to decrease about 14% in 2015 in dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. Keep in mind however with the weak real, the value is much more attractive in the local currency. Even with the recent drop in prices, ag fundamental remain positive for grains and sugar margins are expected to improve in the coming year.","Our 2015 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 11. Although the ag economy remains in a relatively healthy state, lower commodity prices and farm income are putting pressure on demand for farm equipment, especially larger models. At the same time, conditions in the livestock sector are more positive, providing support to sales of mid and smaller-sized tractors. As a result, we expect industry sales in the United States and Canada to be down 25% to 30% for 2015.","The EU28 industry outlook is down about 10% due to lower crop prices and farm incomes as well as potential pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be down about 10% in 2015 as a result of the headwinds affecting agricultural producers. This follows a 13% decline in 2014 compared with the extremely strong levels of 2013.","Shifting to the CIS, we expect industry sales to further deteriorate with western ag equipment manufacturers feeling the most impact due to geopolitical issues and resulting restrictions on credit availability. In Asia, sales are projected to be down slightly. Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the US and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2015.","Putting this all together on Slide 12, fiscal year 2015 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 20%. The Ag & Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 8% in 2015 due to lower shipment volumes and a less favorable product mix as large ag machinery shipments declined.","Before moving to Construction & Forestry, I want to stress Ag & Turf sales were down 9% in 2014 and are anticipated to be down another 20% in 2015. In relation to our structure line, that would bring sales down to what we consider trough levels, with the division operating at less than 80% of normal volumes.","Now let's focus on to Construction & Forestry on Slide 13. Net sales were up 23% in the quarter. Operating profit was up 93%, the result of higher shipment volumes and lower SA&G expenses as the division continues to cut costs. The division's incremental margin was about 31%.","Moving to Slide 14, looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, the economy continues to move forward. GDP growth is improving. Unemployment is falling and construction hiring is on the increase. Housing starts are slowly ramping up. Home inventories are low and lot shortages exist.","Based on these factors, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are forecast to be up about 5% in 2015. Global forestry markets are expected to be about flat on the heels of a 10% increase in 2014. C&F's full year operating margin is projected to be about 11%.","Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 15 shows Financial Services provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio at the end of the year was 9 basis points. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. Our financial forecast for 2015 contemplates a loss provision of about 24 basis points. The increased provision is a reflection of the unsustainably low loss levels of the last four years. Even with the increase being forecast, losses would remain below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15-year average of 43 basis points.","Moving to Slide 16, Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $172 million in the fourth quarter versus $157 million last year. 2014 net income attributable to Deere & Company was $624 million. The 2015 forecast is about $610 million.","Slide 17 outlines receivables and inventory. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the year down $1.2 billion. That was equal to 22.7% of prior 12-month sales compared to 24.8% a year ago. The decrease, which came entirely from Ag & Turf, is reflective of the aggressive way we have cut production in line with our 2015 outlook. We expect to end 2015 with total receivables and inventory up about $400 million, with the increase coming from the C&F division.","Our 2015 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on Slide 18 is about 78%. When modeling 2015, keep these factors in mind: price of about 2 points as well as an unfavorable mix of product as we discussed earlier and tier-4 product cost.","Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. Looking at R&D expense on Slide 19, R&D was up about 2% in the fourth quarter and down about 2% for the year. Our 2015 forecast calls for R&D to be about flat with 2014 levels.","Moving now to Slide 20, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down about 14% in the fourth quarter and down 12% for the full year. Landscapes and Water accounted for about 9 points of the change in the fourth quarter and about 8 points for the year. On Slide 21, our 2015 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 5%. Landscapes and Water will account for about 2 points of the change in the year-over-year comparison.","Turning to Slide 22, pension and OPEB expense was down about $20 million for the quarter and down about $145 million for the full year. Pension and OPEB expense is forecast to be up about $85 million in 2015.","On Slide 23, the equipment operations tax rate was approximately 40% in the fourth quarter primarily due to the impairment charge for our China operations mentioned earlier. The full year 2014 tax rate was about 34%. For 2015, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.","Slide 24 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations was approximately $4.5 billion in 2014 and is forecast to be about $2.9 billion in 2015.","Slide 25 outlines our use of cash priorities, which are unchanged and of no doubt familiar to many of you. Our number one priority is to manage the balance sheet including liquidity to support a rating that provides access to low-cost and readily available short and long-term funding. Thus Deere is strongly committed to its A rating.","Our second use of cash priority is funding value-creating investments in our operations. Our third priority is to provide for the common stock dividend, which has been raised 114% since 2010. Over time, we want to consistently deliver a series of moderately increased dividends, while targeting at mid-cycle earnings, 25% to 35% payout ratio on average. In this regard, we are mindful of the importance of maintain the dividend and not raising it beyond a point that can't be sustained by our cash flow.","Share repurchase is our preferred method of deploying excess cash once the previous requirements are met and as long as such repurchase is value enhancing. In 2014, Deere repurchased 31.5 million shares at a cost of $2.7 billion, the highest on record. Cumulatively, from 2004 to 2014, we have returned about 60% of cash from the equipment operations to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","The 2015 outlook for the first quarter and full year is on Slide 26. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 21% compared with 2014. This includes price realization of 2 points. In the year-over-year comparison of first quarter sales, Landscapes and Water account for about 2 points of the change. When modeling the first quarter, keep in mind that ag division will see a considerable decrease in volume in addition to an unfavorable product and geographical mix versus the first quarter of 2014.","The full year forecast calls for net sales to be down about 15%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 2 points. Finally, our full year 2015 net income forecast is about $1.9 billion.","In closing, there is no question John Deere faces challenging conditions in 2015. Yet, even with a further pull-back in the global agricultural sector, the company expects to remain solidly profitable in the year ahead. Our earnings forecast reflects the aggressive actions we are taking to control costs and assets and make deep cuts in factory production. And it shows a benefit of having a business lineup that is about more than large farm equipment.","And one other thing, the trends that hold so much promise for John Deere's future translates on population growth, rising living standards and increased demand for grain remain very much intact. They are largely unaffected by the periodic ups and downs of the farm economy.","As a result, we believe John Deere can earn solid returns even in a weak farm economy, deliver financial performance much improved over downturns of the past and see substantial benefits from the world's growing need for food, shelter and infrastructure in the years ahead.","Tony?","Tony Huegel","Thank you, Susan. Now we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. But as a reminder, in consideration of others, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Laura?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz. Please state your company name.","Andrew Kaplowitz","This is Barclays, nice quarter. Tony, so Susan talked about your FY '15 guidance being as your definition of trough levels. But can you talk about your condition level that the market won't go below trough, given a relatively strong upturn we've had over the last several years? Is it because you see Europe and Brazil at very low levels, or do you think North American high horsepower will trough in FY '15?","Tony Huegel","As Susan mentioned, as you think about the way we view the business and the below 80% and as you're aware, that would put us below trough levels as we tend to be the business running generally between 80 and 120. As you think about the obvious question how long will it last, will things get worse, first of all, let's be fair, it is a bit premature to think about what will happen beyond 2015. But in some of the analysis that's been done internally specifically around from our Chief Economist and again we continue to believe that farm cash receipt is the best indicator of sales in the US and Canada and specifically for large ag it would be tied much more closely to crop cash receipts, which we've seen come down quite a bit recently.","But our Chief Economist had pointed out that much of that increase in the US corn stocks that we've seen is related to a bulk normal weather, and that's resulted in yield really well in excess of trend. If you look out into 2015 and 2016, so the crop that will be planted this spring, if you assume trend yield, so just normal weather, not above normal weather, but normal weather trend yield, assume demand continues at same pace as 2015, so no increase in demand, holding demand solid, even if you assume acreage stays the same, you would see a drawdown in US corn carryovers as a result of that. The demand would outpace the production. And of course, as you're probably aware, most analysts now expect US corn farmers to reduce acreage somewhat next year. So if you assume smaller acreage trend yield, that would be very supportive of both corn prices and would likely boost cash receipts.","Raj Kalathur","You've been talking about the end market demand for commodities. That has been growing strongly since '96. And if you look at corn prices are very sensitive at low stocks-to-use ratio levels. And we are talking about even in the '14\/'15 period about sub-15% stock-to-use ratio levels. And as Tony said, at trend yields, it is hard to see how our current large ag forecast for fiscal 2015 can last several years, let alone get worse, unless and again our Chief Economist would say, unless we can predict very good rally years continuously for multiple years.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Can you talk about your share buyback activity? You obviously stepped it up in the quarter quite a bit. But how should we think about it in 2015, given the lower free cash flow you're going to have? It still seems like you have relatively good flexibility on your balance sheet to keep your A rating, given the strong free cash flow in 4Q. But can you talk about your ability to do more in 2015?","Raj Kalathur","First, 2015 operating cash flows are still pretty strong. And as you know, Andy, our use of cash priorities, they are well articulated. We remain committed to these priorities. And of course, for share repurchases, it is a use of excess cash. And for that, we desire for repurchases to be value enhancing for our long-term shareholders. So we are mindful of the current share price relative to our intrinsic value.","Now share repurchase decision will continue to be made with these factors in mind. And if you look at 2004 through '14, 60% of equipment operations operating cash flow was returned to shareholders either via dividends or share repurchases. And over an extended period of time, we expect to continue returning this level of cash to shareholders.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Volkmann. Please state your company name.","Steve Volkmann","It's Jefferies. I'm wondering if we can just get a little more kind of near term and granular here. Can you just talk about what you're seeing with respect to whatever order reports you might have used as you thought about your forecast for 2015? And I guess I'm trying to think about how much visibility you actually have into this and maybe you can sort of loop in the kind of used equipment question at the same time.","Tony Huegel","As you look at the early order programs that we based the forecast on, again these would relate to large ag equipment except for large tractors, so things like combines, sprayers, planters, tillage equipment. We've certainly seen a reduction, but keep in mind also that we have seen a number of changes year-over-year in these programs. So if you think about combines, last year we had an early order window ahead of the typical early order program related to tier-4 transitions. Sprayers also were impacted by transitions. Planters we had a fast start program, so again kind of an extra early order window.","So there are a lot of differences year-over-year. But given that we look at early November, most programs are down 40% or more on the early order program. That again is not making any adjustments for those year-over-year differences where we saw some more aggressive orders early on with these products. But those are types of numbers that we're seeing. Certainly tractors, as you look at availability on large tractors, that's a bit more challenging, because there we have a significant different year-over-year in our daily build rate. And so availability isn't necessarily that significantly different. The biggest difference would really be on our 8R wheeled tractors. But outside of that, availability is pretty consistent year-over-year. But again, to be fair, that's on lower daily run rates.","If you think about used equipment, certainly as you come through a period, and we talked about this quite a lot, of very strong sales, that's going to result in high levels of used equipment. And certainly we continue to face that. We are working with our dealers to improve and we continue to improve the used equipment management. We talked last quarter about the certified preowned program that was launched in August. That certain gained some traction and helping with the situation. But to be candid, we're still facing higher levels of used equipment than what we would desire moving into a year like we are in 2015. But I think in the past, our dealers have demonstrated their ability to move that equipment through the system and certainly we have pool funds in place to help facilitate that as well.","Probably most importantly, as you look at pricing year-over-year, through the year we saw some reduction. We're starting to lap some of that production a bit and saw prices come down a bit in the year. We're starting to lap some of those lower prices. So most of the large ag equipment, you're plus or minus a single digit in terms of year-over-year pricing. So it has moderated at this point at lease for Deere. We would tell you at least intelligence we show would indicate that our pricing and our inventory levels are in much better shape than the competition.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Fisher. Please state your company name.","Steven Fisher","It's UBS. Just curious how you guys approached the guidance this year. I think a lot of investors are interested in your perspective as to whether it should be considered conservative, because I think you've been conservative historically, but at the same time there were still some surprises this past year on ag. Just curious for any additional color you might be able to provide on your approach.","Tony Huegel","As you think about next year, obviously depending on the market that you're talking about, you have more or less visibility. Kind of going back to Steve Volkmann's previous question, as you think about large ag in the US and Canada, however, while we don't have full visibility at this point, we certainly have a much better visibility in this market for that large ag equipment than we would in any of our other markets through our early order programs, the availability on large factors, those sorts of things. And I would tell you that our forecast is very much in line with those expectations.","To your point, there's always risk, but we would attempt at this point in the year to come out with what our best estimate is for the market based on what we're seeing in our order books and what we're hearing from dealers and customers.","Raj Kalathur","I would add that the way we're preparing for it is pretty aggressive in terms that we're preparing for a greater fall in ag than what may actually happen. And again, the philosophy if at the end the ag end markets prove to be more resilient and positive, it should be easier for us to walk up with the market. And if you look at what we're doing in terms of pulling levers, as you heard in Susan's comments, we are pulling levers pretty aggressively whether it is on the expense side, SA&G.","If you look at what our forecast was in 2014 at the beginning of the year, 4% down to at the end of the year in 2014 12% and '15 it's going to be further 5% down. And inventory receivables even at the end of the third quarter, we said we'll be down about $300 million. We were actually down $1.2 billion. And that should show we are actually pulling levers pretty hard on expenses, costs and assets and you can go on with capital expenditures, you'll see a similar trend. Every agricultural unit is executing our plans to walk down the line. Look at the large ag units, they're implementing crop plants.","So we are aggressively reacting to it.","Steven Fisher","And then just a follow-up on the used inventories question. I know you mentioned, Tony, that maybe they are not coming down as quickly as you'd like. So I guess to what extent do you think dealers need further incentives to help sell that used equipment and to what extent is Deere considering stepping up to provide those incentives?","Tony Huegel","As you know, Steve, we have implemented, especially as it relates to large equipment, a pool fund strategy that's been in place for a number of years now that would provide the incentives that we believe our dealers need to move this equipment. And so we do continue to monitor the level of pool funds available to dealers. We think they're still at supportive levels.","And so in terms of for us when we move into these lower end-markets, you wouldn't see us necessarily with higher incentive costs related to this, because again theoretically the pool funds are there and already available for our dealers to move this equipment based on what we've contributed with the new equipment sales that have driven the use.","So I would say I wouldn't anticipate higher overall incentive budget as you move year-to-year other than what's natural. You'll naturally see a little bit higher percentage as you move into lower end-markets, but you won't see a huge increase or really much of an increase at all in used incentives necessarily.","Operator","The next question comes from David Raso. Please state your company name.","David Raso","Evercore ISI. A question on the C&F segment. I'm just trying to think through the recent growth rates. You're implying strong incremental margins for next year and you're also implying your inventory and receivables to go up $775 million. That all sounds like a positive view on that market. But then you give a 5% topline for the segment. Can you square up that kind of inventory and receivable build, but only assuming 5% for your own growth?","Tony Huegel","That's a great question and glad you mentioned it, because it does look on the surface like field inventories and our inventories are going up pretty dramatically at least relative to the sales level. What I would tell you there is there have been some changes in some of the wholesale terms on C&F and really they're changes that better align us to the market. As a result of that, we believe that will result in a little bit higher level of receivable. In fact, most of that increase, the vast majority of that increase is actually receivables. But I want to stress that not a huge increase in the field inventory levels is really a difference in what gets financed with John Deere financial versus maybe some other outside financing entities.","David Raso","And then lastly, it's the end of the year on ag. Can you help us with North American dealer inventory? I know you look at used inventory at the dealers as a percent of their trailing 12-month sales. Can you give us some metrics so we can benchmark throughout the year, like where do you feel you are now and where do you plan to exit the year when you give us this inventory receivable type number for the company of down $375 million? On a production basis, do you feel you will be setting up your dealers to exit 2015 with the appropriate inventory levels?","Tony Huegel","That would always be our intention. In fact, I would point out we had very large decrease, especially in the fourth quarter, as we pulled back on production. So a lot of what maybe some had anticipated in lower receivables and inventory in 2015 actually happened in early 2014, which builds a little bit to the cash flow story in the sense of some pointed out the lower cash flow in '15. But remember, we ended '14 $500 million higher than what we had been forecasting, and that was all driven by a greater reduction in inventory and receivables than what we had been forecasting.","So we've done a lot of work already, but certainly has some additional work as we move through the year. So absolutely we would expect to have our dealers in good shape from an inventory perspective as we exit 2015. We think we're in pretty decent shape today as it relates to that. In fact if you look in the appendix of the slide, we do talk about some of our inventory as it relates to row crop tractors and combines. Generally as you know, our large ag equipment, we tend to be about half of what the rest of the industry would have as a percent of sales. We ended this year at 6% the end of October 6% of trailing 12-month sales.","We don't have the October data yet for industry, but if you look at the September data, the rest of the industry will be almost six times the level of inventory we would have on combines at the end of October. And I recognize you get a month of difference there. So I'm assuming that you haven't pulled back their inventory during the month of October. But that's a significant difference and one that we would expect to continue to maintain.","David Raso","But on the used side, I think that's clearly the issue, right? Obviously a dealer is telling you to take the used trade in. So his comfort with his used is probably as important as anything right now going into trying to think through '15 going into '16. Is there any metric you can give us, some sense of dealer used to trailing 12-month sales was, whatever the number was at, say, \"the peak\", three, four, five months ago, where is it now and where do you expect to be in '15?","Tony Huegel","Unfortunately, we'd never disclose that. We would be higher in the bands and certainly would be looking to move those inventory levels toward the bottom end of the band. And unfortunately, I just can't share much more than that. From a competitive perspective, we don't share those details.","Operator","The next question comes from Nicole DeBlase. Please state your company name.","Nicole DeBlase","It's Morgan Stanley. So my question is around the Sinko. It looks like you guys are only projecting like a 3% year-on-year decline in Sinko net income during 2015. So I'm just curious with ag down so much, how you're maintaining net income year-on-year and is it possible that we could see a lag impact of this where Sinko net income starts to fall more in 2016?","Tony Huegel","As we talked about, certainly there is a little bit of a lag factor in terms of how lower sales would impact the portfolio of John Deere Financial. In fact next year, we would be expecting some increase in the portfolio even with these kinds of decreases. So as you think about the average life of the note generally is around three years, even though they're five-year notes in most cases, but you'd have an average of about three years. So there is again that kind of tail, as those high sales years continue to benefit the portfolio.","I would also point out that as you think about the slope, and we talked about our structure line, of the structure line for John Deere Financial is much flatter, but you don't tend to see even as you move in and out of cycles as dramatic of an impact on their returns as you go through the cycle. So while you could argue if you're going to assume lower portfolio growth or reduction in the portfolio, you'd see some lower income. You wouldn't expect to see the type of magnitude that you see on the equipment side.","Nicole DeBlase","And then my second question is Section 179, what have you guys embedded in the outlook? Are you expecting reinstatement?","Tony Huegel","Not in our outlook. So just as we said in recent conversations, we continue to assume that they're in our forecasting, we're assuming that there is no extension of the tax incentive. Now at the same time, we would also continue to tell you that we believe the odds still favor an acceptable resolution. Candidly next week will be very telling in terms of whether that will happen this calendar year or whether that's something that will happen in the 2015.","Operator","The next question comes from Jamie Cook. Please state your company name.","Jamie Cook","Credit Suisse. I guess just two questions, one on the pricing front. I think you said about 2%. I know you don't like to disclose what your assumptions are in ag versus construction. I am assuming you'll assume you'll get some pricing on the ag side. Given the severity of the market, can you just talk about your comfort level? And would you be willing to maintain price even at the risk of losing market share?","And then my second question is, I think the implied decrementals on the ag business is like 35%, 40%. Can you just talk about the cadence? Should the first half be much worse, or do we normalize to that level as we exit the year?","Tony Huegel","As you think about pricing into next year, and I would point out both Ag & Turf and Construction & Forestry are contributing to that number. So they're both positive. We would tell you that certainly we feel pretty confident in the forecast that we have with the price realization. And keep in mind, as you look back over the last decade, it's actually been closer to 3%, actually a little over 3% on average. So we are recognizing a little bit lower level of price realization than what we've seen in the last decade or so on average.","Jamie Cook","But for example, on the fourth quarter, I think you only got 1%, right? So I don't know if that's reflective of the market got much weaker.","Tony Huegel","Keep in mind, with tier-4 transitions and so on, some of that is about timing year-over-year of when those hit in terms of the price increases. Generally we would just now start seeing our price increases being effective 1 November. A year ago, you could have seen some products with some earlier price as we moved through the year. In fact, as we talked about the 8R and 7R tractors, we took a short-term price increase and then another bump when we went to final tier-4 as one example.","So sometimes the timing of those will impact the year-over-year quarter. So I wouldn't imply anything by that 1% in the fourth quarter being reflective of lower as we move forward. As you think about the decremental, certainly as we talked about and Susan strongly hinted at it in her opening comments, remember that in our first quarter in particular, we have a very difficult compare with the first quarter of 2014. I think we talked about it actually on the last quarter call as well.","Because of tier-4 transitions, we shipped a fair number of more combines in particular in the first quarter last year than what we typically would. And that is obviously not going to repeat itself this year. And so it will be a difficult comp. And I would argue that you should expect the decrementals to reflect that in the first quarter for sure.","Operator","The next question comes from Jerry Revich. Please state your company name.","Jerry Revich","It's Goldman Sachs. I'm wondering if you could talk about just dealer inventories. It looks like you're not expecting much of a shift in ag trade receivables in inventories next year. And in the slide deck, you laid out the inventories on a trailing 12-month basis. But if you switch those around to a forward-looking basis, based on the orders you outlined, you're at about 30% of forward sales in row crop tractors and 8% in combines. So can you just step us through why we shouldn't expect a more significant reduction in trade receivables in ag compared to the slide that you laid out?","Tony Huegel","I think I mentioned it when speaking with David. Keep in mind that when you're looking at the '15, you have to also look at what we did in '14, in particular in the fourth quarter of 2014. So we have dramatically reduced in the fourth quarter the level of inventory both within our Deere inventory as well as our field inventory levels. And so we've done a lot of work already. We talked about reducing our production to keep our manufacturing in line with what we're seeing in retail demand.","And as importantly, remember that we've done a lot of work in recent years as we have moved to the built-to-order strategy to again really reduce our field inventories in both good years and not so good years. And so we don't have as much work as perhaps some of our competitors, certainly what we would have had historically in terms of heavy levels of field inventory that needs to get draw down as we move into these cycles.","Part of the strategy in terms of being able to continue to provide the type of strong returns is that we would expect throughout an entire cycle even as we move into a downturn. And so I think as you look at our returns next year, that's reflective of that. We're very confident in the level of inventory and receivables that we currently have forecasted at the end of 2015. Of course as we go through the year, we'll refine that and we'll make changes as we look and start to get better visibility of what 2016 is going to look like. But at this point, we're very confident in that forecast.","Jerry Revich","And then I'm wondering if you could talk about on the Financial Services business, just touch on, if you could, the delinquency rates that you're seeing at this point versus a year ago? And I know your loss provision accounting is up slightly. Can you just flush it out for us a bit more, because obviously you're coming off a very good year?","Tony Huegel","I think the short answer to that is as we're certainly forecasting a higher provision level, and Susan mentioned it's really more reflective of the fact that we have been at unsustainbly low, we tried to communicate that repeatedly that we were at unsustainbly low levels. I would maybe turn that around a little bit and say it is absolutely not or should not be taken as any indication that we have weakness in that portfolio. It continues to be a very strong, very sound portfolio. We're not seeing really increases in our past due rates or anything of that nature. It's just recognizing that we aren't going to stay at these historically low levels as we move forward. So there's not much more I can say on that.","Operator","The next question comes from Mircea Dobre. Please state your company name.","Mircea Dobre","Robert Baird. Just maybe looking to clarify from the prior line of questioning here, your shipments to US and Canadian dealers for 2015, my understanding is that based on where inventory levels currently are should be lagging your retail sales forecast. Am I interpreting this correctly? Can you maybe frame it?","Tony Huegel","Our volumes would be slightly lower, yes, because we are bringing down receivables somewhat in the year. That's the $375 million.","Mircea Dobre","And then my second question, I guess, is on R&D and SG&A. You're guiding for flat R&D and I'm trying to understand why we shouldn't be seeing this line item come down a little bit and SG&A down only maybe like 3% excluding Landscapes and Water, even though the revenue obviously is moving quite a bit lower. Are there some levers that you can pull there that perhaps you're not discussing at this point?","Tony Huegel","Certainly last quarter we talked about it. Raj mentioned in his comments that with R&D, we would be balancing both the desire to pull levers as well as recognizing our need to continue to invest in our business. And so effectively holding that flat is a reflection of that. As you look at SA&G, while you could potentially argue that you were apparently anticipating a little higher level of reduction. You also have to look back and recognize what we did in '14 and in particular as we started to pull levers in the fourth quarter.","So I would just tell you similar to receivables and inventory continue to look at both of those together in terms of the two years combined. So instead of looking at just what we did in '15, recognize what we did in '14 as well.","Raj Kalathur","On R&D, while it's flat, if you look at within it the components, the portion that's coming off of the emissions, that will be allocated more towards either production innovations or more towards continuous improvement. And the continuous improvement part should help us in the cost reduction side.","Operator","The next question comes from Ross Gilardi. Please state your company name.","Ross Gilardi","Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I just had a couple of questions on the Brazilian market. I mean the combine numbers were a little steadier last month. Do you have any thoughts on that? Are you seeing any stabilization in your order books down in Brazil, or could that have been some pre-buying in anticipation of a hike in FINAME? And then my related question would be on FINAME. What do you expect to see there?","Tony Huegel","I think you're potentially correct in terms of what's going on there. Again, we are looking for the lower end markets. Our Group there would tell you moving more towards typical or more normal levels were coming off still a very high level than 2013. So the market is still strong. It's still a very attractive market for us, but it is coming down a bit more off of those '14 levels. I wouldn't ever read much into monthly numbers, if you will.","Certainly there is some speculation that farmers will be buying ahead of the announcement on FINAME, simply because there is uncertainty. And generally, what we would expect and what most are expecting is that the FINAME rates will stay close to where they are currently, so flat to up slightly, maybe 50 basis point improvement. That's really what we're assuming is in that realm. I don't think there's anyone assuming they're going to go down. So that's part of the reason why you may be seeing a little bit of pull ahead now in anticipation of what may happen. So flat to slight increase is what we're anticipating for FINAME.","Operator","The next question comes from Ann Duignan. Please state your company name.","Ann Duignan","JPMorgan. Can we talk a little bit about your outlook for '15 to be trough and 80% below normal or at 80% of normal? The last time you said we hit normal was back in 2006. And clearly, the outlook going into '15 is not 20% below the volume levels we saw in 2006. So can you just address your comfort level with '15 being the trough and what could go wrong? Where is the downside? You've given us all the upside.","Tony Huegel","As you think about trough levels, to your point, as we look at the market and to be fair, keep in mind, as you pointed 2006, we adjust what we view as normal levels every year, as we grow our market share, as we enter new markets, those sorts of things. So it isn't a static number as you move forward. And certainly we've seen growth in our business since 2006. By the way, the A&T forecast would not be at 80%. That should be below 80% in our forecast.","I think from a confidence perspective, again it's our best view of the market. It's how we are currently interpreting that. I think if you look historically as well in prior downturns, to expect another significant step-down next year would imply you'd have three years in a row with pretty strong reductions. That would not be the norm, as you look historically. In fact there's only really one period if you look from 1965 forward where we saw three sequential years of lower sales. And even in that scenario, one of those years, I think, was less than 1% down. The other two were a little bit higher step function down.","And so given all of that, given how we view the market, given where we had seen things from a historic basis, our view would be that the risk of 2015 sales certainly being down significantly from this level is relatively small.","Ann Duignan","But what are some of the downside risks?","Tony Huegel","I would tell you the biggest downside risk would be that we would have incredibly positive weather again and that you would see trend yields moving forward. J.B. Penn, our Chief Economist, you know well, would say that normal weather even you would see stock levels come down, commodity prices move up. And that would be supportive of cash receipts. So again, we think that while there's always risk, we think it's really very, very low.","Operator","The final question comes from Adam Uhlman. Please state your company name.","Adam Uhlman","It's Cleveland Research. I was wondering if we could through the Ag & Turf revenue outlook, if you can maybe talk about how you're thinking about Deere's revenues in 2015 in comparison to what you forecast the unit volumes for each of the geographies, where you think you might outperform and underperform. And then wrapped into that, just my question on what your assumption is for parts revenues next year?","Tony Huegel","We don't guide on parts revenues, but similar to Financial Services, we would point out that the slope is much flatter on parts. So you move in and out of downturns and upturns, it will fluctuate with the market, but not as dramatically. So I can't say much more than that really on parts.","Generally I would tell you that most of our assumptions, as you think about industry relatively in line, the biggest one that we always talk about with industry is Brazil at this point. Certainly we would continue to anticipate market share growth. The other thing to always remember with Brazil is that industry outlook is only looking at tractors and combines, not the other markets. And we do have a significant amount of our sales coming from things like sugarcane harvesters and planters and sprayers and that type of equipment.","So with that, we're over a little bit and I apologize for that. So we'll go ahead and bring our call to a close. And we appreciate your participation on the call. And as always, we'll be available the rest of the day to answer any additional questions you may have. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time."],"7103":["Deere & Co.

Your lines have been placed in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference.","I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tony Huegel, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Hello. Also on the call today are Raj Kalathur, our Chief Financial Officer; and Josh Jepsen, our Manager of Investor Communications. Today we'll take a closer look at Deere's first quarter earnings, then spend some time talking about our markets and our current outlook for fiscal 2017. After that we'll respond to your questions. Please note that slides are available to complement the call this morning. They can be accessed on our website at www.johndeere.com\/earnings.","First a reminder, this call is being broadcast live on the Internet and recorded for future transmission and use by Deere & Company.

Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in the company's most recent Form 8-K and periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call also may include financial measures that are not in conformance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. Additional information concerning these measures including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures is included in the release and posted on our website at www.johndeere.com\/earnings under Other Financial Information.","Josh?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","With the announcement of our first quarter earnings, John Deere has started the year on a positive note and done so in the continued face of soft market conditions. Though earnings were somewhat lower than last year, all of our businesses remained solidly profitable. Some of the factors helping our performance in the quarter included sound execution, a broad product portfolio and the impact of a more flexible cost structure. At the same time, we are seeing encouraging signs that after several years of steep declines our key agricultural markets may be stabilizing. Partly as a result, we raised our full year forecast for sales and earnings.","Now let's take a closer look at our first quarter results in detail beginning on slide three. Net sales and revenues were up 2% to $5.6 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $194 million. EPS was $0.61 in the quarter. Our equipment operations effective tax rate was 50% in the first quarter due largely and unfavorable discrete items. It is worth noting the effective tax rate of the equipment operations in the first quarter of 2016 was 20%. That reflected a benefit from a permanent extension of the R&D tax credit and other favorable adjustments.","On slide four, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 1% to $4.7 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation was positive by 1 point. Turning to a review of our individual businesses, starting with Agriculture & Turf on slide five. Net sales were flat in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower shipment volumes and higher warranty costs were offset by price realization and the favorable effect of currency translation.","Operating profit was $213 million, up from $144 million last year. Ag & Turf operating margins were 5.9% in the quarter. The increase in operating profit was driven primarily by a gain on sale of a partial interest in SiteOne Landscape Supply, Inc. and price realization. These were partially offset by voluntary separation expenses, higher warranty costs and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange.","The gain on sale of a partial interest in SiteOne Landscape Supply contributed nearly 3 points of operating margin in the quarter, while expenses related to the voluntary separation program lowered margins by nearly 2 points. Excluding these impacts, operating margins were about 1 point higher than in last year's first quarter.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the Ag business. Slide six outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the large crop harvest and consequently the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2016 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 5% from 2015's levels. Moving to 2017, we expect total cash receipts to be about $367 billion, roughly flat with 2016. It is worth noting that net farm cash income, a good measure of farm business health, is forecast to be up slightly in 2017. You can see this information in the appendix.","On slide seven, global grain and oilseed stocks-to-use for ratios are forecast to remain at elevated but generally unchanged levels in 2016, 2017 as abundant crops are mostly offset by strong demand around the world. Chinese grain and oilseed stocks continued to increase in 2016 with supply, domestic production plus imports outpacing the demand. Chinese stocks of grains and oilseeds now represent almost half of the world's stocks.","Remember, these Chinese stocks are unlikely to be exported. That means the world market, particularly oilseeds remain sensitive to any production setbacks, major geopolitical disruptions or trade disputes. World cotton stocks have now fallen for a second consecutive season to the lowest level in five seasons. This reflects lower planting and stronger global demand.","Our economic outlook for the EU28 is on slide eight. Economic growth in the region is improving at a moderate pace, though geopolitical risks such as Brexit and populist sentiment remain elevated, as does currency volatility. Farm income remains below the long-term average due to high global grain stocks and last year's poor harvest in the Northwest EU, particularly France. The diary market is seeing early signs of recovery as prices are forecast to return to average levels after many years of decline. Sentiment and margins are expected to improve throughout 2017.","Shifting to Brazil on slide nine. The chart on the left displays the crop value of agricultural product, a good proxy for the health of Agri business in Brazil. Ag production is expected to increase about 8% in 2017 in U.S. dollar terms due to record acreage expansion in yield expectations. In local currency, the value of production is forecast to be up about 3%. Profitability for Brazilian farmers remains at good levels as crops are sold in dollars.","On the right side of the slide, you will see eligible rates for Ag-related government-sponsored finance programs. Rates for Moderfrota remain at 8.5% for small and mid-size farmers and 10.5% for large farmers. Importantly, the overall budget for Moderfrota has been raised by nearly 50% from the initial R$5 billion to R$7.5 billion. This demonstrates the government's ongoing commitment to Agriculture and is driving continued improvement in farmer confidence.","Our 2017 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on slide 10. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be down 5% to 10%, with the effects being felt in both large and small models of equipment, particularly affected our products used in the livestock sector such as mid-sized tractors and hay and forage tools. Still, there are signs the large Ag market is nearing bottom. For example, the magnitude of the industry decline expected in 2017 is considerably less than that experienced in 2016.","Also, the used equipment environment is stabilizing. The EU28 industry outlook is forecast to be down about 5% in 2017, due to low crop prices and farm incomes as well as the geopolitical risks mentioned earlier. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be up 15% to 20% in 2017. This is a reflection of improved confidence, slowing inflation, and lower benchmark interest rates in Brazil as well as positive industry sentiment in Argentina. Shifting to Asia, sales are expected to be flat to up slightly, with growth in India being the main driver.","Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be roughly flat in 2017, with Deere sales outpacing the industry.","Putting this all together, on slide 11, fiscal year 2017 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be up about 3%. The forecast change is a result of sales improving in all regions of the world, most notably in South America. The Ag & Turf division's operating margin is forecast to be about 9% in 2017, roughly in line with 2016.","Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on slide 12. Net sales were down 6% in the quarter as a result of lower shipment volumes and higher sales incentive costs. Operating profit was $34 million in the quarter, down from $70 million last year. Lower results were driven mainly by higher sales incentive costs and the voluntary separation program. C&F operating margins were 3.1% in the quarter. Expenses related to the voluntary separation program were incurred as expected in the quarter, creating a nearly 1.5-point headwind to operating margins.","Moving to slide 13, looking at the economic indicators affecting the construction and forestry industries, there was a slight improvement in the fundamentals. GDP growth is positive, job growth continues, construction spending is up from 2016 levels, and housing starts are expected to exceed 1.2 million units this year. Construction investment in oil and gas activity improved in the fourth quarter of calendar 2016 after seven quarters of decline, while residential and commercial institutional construction continued to increase moderately. Machinery rental utilization rates have made slight improvements after multiple quarters of deterioration, and forward-looking sentiment has improved with the prospect for higher infrastructure spending.","On the other hand, used inventory for the industry remains above normal levels and rental rates are still soft. Also, economic growth outside the United States, particularly in Latin America, is sluggish. All in all, our outlook on the construction industry is cautiously optimistic.","Moving to the C&F outlook on slide 14, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be up about 7% in 2017, largely driven by production moving closer to retail demand. The forecast for global forestry markets is flat to down 5%, a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full-year operating margin is now projected to be about 5%.","Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 15 shows the provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. At the end of January, the annualized provision for credit losses was 8 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2017, shown on the slide, contemplates a loss provision of 29 basis points, unchanged from the previous forecast. This will put losses just above the 10-year average of 26 basis points and below the 15-year average of 34 basis points.","Moving to slide 16, Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $114 million in the quarter versus $129 million last year. The lower results were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads and expenses related to the voluntary separation program. 2017 net income attributable to Deere & Company is forecast to be about $480 million, unchanged from our previous forecast.","Slide 17 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $461 million. We expect to end 2017 with total receivables and inventory down about $200 million, with reductions being made by both equipment divisions. With respect to North American large Ag field inventories, Deere inventories as a percent of rolling total sales are roughly half of those of the rest of the industry. As an example, at the end of December, the inventory-to-sales ratio for Deere two-wheel drive tractors of 100-horsepower plus was 37%, while the industry less Deere was 81%.","Slide 18 shows cost of sales as a percent of net sales. Cost of sales for the first quarter was 80.8%, which included the impact of the voluntary separation program costs. Our 2017 cost of sales guidance is about 78% of net sales, unchanged from the last quarter. When modeling 2017, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: an unfavorable product mix; emissions costs; voluntary separation expenses; and overhead spend. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point.","Now let's look at some additional details. With respect to R&D on slide 19, R&D was down 3% in the first quarter, including the cost associated with the voluntary separation program. Our 2017 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 2%.","Moving to slide 20, SA&G expense for the quarter for the equipment operations was up 12%, with the main drivers being the voluntary separation program expenses and commissions paid to dealers, which result from direct sales to customers. Our 2017 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being up by about 5%. More than half of the full-year change is expected to come from voluntary separation expenses and commissions to dealers.","Turning to slide 21, the equipment operations tax rate was 50% in the first quarter, primarily due to discrete items, as noted earlier. For 2017, the full-year effective tax rate forecast remains in the range of 33% to 35%.","Slide 22 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $2.6 billion in 2017. The company's financial outlook is on slide 23. Net sales for the second quarter are forecast to be up about 1% compared with 2016. This includes about 2 points of price realization. Our full year outlook now calls for net sales to be up about 4%, which includes about 1 point of price realization. Finally, our full year 2017 net income forecast is now about $1.5 billion.","In closing, John Deere continues to perform far better than in agricultural downturns of the past. And our first quarter results provide further evidence of that fact. This is due in large part to our ongoing success developing a more durable business model and a wider range of revenue sources. In addition, our efforts to improve operating efficiency are gaining traction and we remain confident we can deliver at least $500 million of structural cost reductions by the end of 2018.","All of this reinforces our belief that Deere is well positioned to deliver significant value to our customers and investors in the future.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Thank you, Josh. Now we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. In consideration of others, and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Cindy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. So the first one is from Ross Gilardi. Your line is now open.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sorry if I missed this at the beginning, but I just want to understand, is the guide increase on net income from $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, is that being driven largely by the SiteOne gain? And can you help us understand why a 300 basis point increase in the revenue guide doesn't drive a greater than $100 million net income guide?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Sure. I think certainly our original budget would not have assumed the SiteOne gain, so that would be part of the change from original budget to our current guidance. Of course, I'd note also in the quarter, as Josh talked about there was a tax impact. That's about $25 million negative.","And then if you think about some of the increased sales that came, mix was not as favorable. I think some would anticipate, especially in the Ag division for example, a higher incremental margin. But keep in mind \u2013 again as Josh pointed out in the opening comments, the sales increases were really pretty wide spread geographically. And to the extent that there were additional sales coming from the U.S. and Canada market, it was mostly or largely coming from small Ag, so compact utility tractors, which again have attractive margins versus things like our large tractors and combines, not quite as significant of a margin. And so that's really what was driving some of that. Okay?","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Thank you, next caller?","Operator","Thank you. Next question's from Timothy Thein of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Tony, the question relates to Financial Services, and I guess I'll tie it in, in part to Josh's comments about some stabilization that you'd seen in the used market in North America. It doesn't appear that you booked an impairment this quarter. I'm just wondering, did that signal kind of an improvement that you've seen in terms of the rate of lease returns, as well as some of the values realized on some of the new sales?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Certainly to your point, no \u2013 really no change in the guidance on Financial Services. As it relates specifically to operating leases, I think I'd say largely the quarter went as expected. So I think many would view that as good news in that regard. And I would point out though to be fair, first quarter is a relatively low quarter for lease returns, you'll see more \u2013 with a seasonal impact, you'll see a bit more in the second quarter. But I think as you think about risk going forward, certainly as we've taken some additional depreciation and impairment in the past to anticipate this, as well as the fact that the used equipment market is appearing to stabilize, is a good sign and gives us I think some, I'll say cautious optimism as we go into second quarter with those operating lease returns. So we'll see how that progresses, but again, at least through the first three months, things moving pretty much as planned for Financial Services. Okay? Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan Securities. Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just to follow up on the last question. Your other operating expense in Financial Services remains elevated, and last quarter a large portion of that was the loss on sale of used equipment. Could you talk about whether you incurred a loss on sale of used equipment in the quarter and how much that was?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Yeah. I mean certainly you see that, and it was forecasted to see some loss on the sale of equipment and again, it was largely according to forecast. If you look at that year-over-year, it was roughly in line with what we incurred last year, so really no elevated level of losses coming from those leases. Maybe I'll just \u2013 some of the other things that we're seeing, volumes actually showed year-over-year in the first quarter a slight decrease, so that's on operating leases, which are pretty good sign, as well as when you think about return rates, we're seeing those return rates also stabilizing.","And I'll further note that as you think about going past second quarter, we largely get beyond that headwind that we've been experiencing with those 12 month leases. And we'd have significantly fewer as we go through the second half of 2017, which again assuming the performance on those longer than 12 month leases maintain or improve, would actually bode pretty well for operating lease returns again as we move further into the year. So hopefully that helps and we'll move on to the next caller. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Hi.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Tony, I'm wondering if you could talk about the stabilization in dealer inventories. It sounds like from the prepared remarks you're producing in line with retail demand this year. Can you just frame for us over the past couple of years how much dealer inventory has come out of the channel? And is there any opportunity for some modest restocking it over the next couple of years? Or are you folks planning on running leaner than you did, call it, three, four years ago in terms of dealer inventories?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","I think as you think about new equipment \u2013 and where we've really talked about through 2016 and even in 2015 is as we ended the year, the target was to have inventories in line with our current retail sales environment. And so, the real difference this year is, we aren't seeing a significant decline in that retail environment year-over-year as we had both in 2015 and 2016. And as a result of that we're able to produce largely to retail demand. Obviously there's going be puts and takes by individual products. But as you think about large Ag in total for the U.S. and Canada, we're producing in line with retail, which does give us some year-over-year benefit obviously in our sales as we're able to do that.","So really the answer to your question would depend on what happens to the retail environment. In a year where you start to see the retail environment improving, that's when we would consider starting to lift that inventory level in line with that. But, again, we're in pretty good shape. Now I think your question was specifically around Ag & Turf. And I'd point out for C&F, we ended the year and, again, we talked about this last quarter, if anything \u2013 inventories at our dealers were actually maybe a little light versus where we would normally have them. And that's where you have some benefit potentially if you start to see some recovery in that market, you'd certainly see some inventory coming back in for C&F. Again, if we see that industry really starting to improve.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. Tony, just wanted to get into the \u2013 I mean you talked about C&F and you talked about where the dealer inventories are. But you did raise your outlook for C&F which is curious to me because I know that's a division that's sort of has disappointed you guys in the past, in terms of being a little optimistic. And then the forecast doesn't follow through. So just sort of on the ground what are you seeing to give you that confidence level that we should be raising guidance, because I think you wanted to take a more conservative approach there, I don't know if you saw anything in the quarter or in January or in February to give you confidence? Thanks.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","I appreciate that question. Certainly a 7% increase in Construction & Forestry for the year is what we're currently guiding. We did see the industry \u2013 our industry outlook improved a little bit certainly from where we were at original budget, but really what we saw in the quarter was a very, very strong order book. And that's what's driving that confidence in terms of where that outlook improved.","Now I'll go back to the previous comments. A lot of this is really the benefit we're seeing in those higher sales and large part is the fact that again, inventories at our dealers ended the year at very, very low levels. And especially compared to the industry, our used equipment at our dealers are actually in very good shape as well. So that does give us the opportunity and, again, some additional optimism that we'll see those sales pull through for the fiscal year. Again, I used the term cautious optimism earlier related to operating leases, I think we'd say the same thing with Construction & Forestry, certainly seeing some optimism, but cautiously viewing that simply because of, to your point, some of the experiences we've had in recent years.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And I know you said the order book improved, but can you put any more color around that or numbers on that? I'm assuming you won't, but I'll try.","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","Hey, Jamie. If you just take the first 12 weeks of orders for this quarter or even 13 weeks, the first quarter versus the same time last year, our orders are up over a third \u2013 this is for U.S. and Canada. So now again, we don't think that's going be the case for the full year. That shows the sentiment out for the dealership, for the customers and so on, okay?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Right. And I'd remind you that some of that is there's optimism that comes in, and we've talked about this all along. Because of where our inventories are at, if our dealers start to sense that there is any kind of improvement in the market, because of the significant destocking they did, there would need to be some additional stocking. And so again, you're seeing that reflected at least in the short-term in our order book, so.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. Next caller is David Raso of Evercore. Your line is open.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","I was curious, organically you raised Ag & Turf revenues by over \u2013 basically $900 million, kind of a 5% swing. But your end market outlooks didn't change notably except for a little bit in South America. Can you help us better understand why the large \u2013 and obviously you didn't change your inventory outlook as well. Is there a change in your production versus retail? I didn't hear that in the earlier answer. Have you changed your view of production versus retail in Ag?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Specifically in Ag, and actually I'll look at the slide that we showed, there's really very little change for Ag when you think about the fiscal forecast, still forecasting inventory\/receivables combined down $125 million. What I would say is I think on the margin we saw some slight improvement across the board geographically with the exception of South America, as you pointed out, not enough really to shift the overall industry guidance, but I think again on the margin, some slight improvement in the underlying industry. But certainly from our sales perspective, we saw maybe a little bit more growth there in terms of market share anticipation in the year.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","So in general, within each range some improvement, with only South America a true bump-up in range?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Correct. Yes, exactly.","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","So, David, this is Raj. Just to add some more color to what Tony said and what Josh said earlier, on the Ag side, we are looking at \u2013 retail is actually growing around the world. So this is in Region 4, we said there are some compact utility tractors. We're also seeing some strength in some commodities like cotton, for example. And then beyond that, you will also look at Region 3. We talked about Brazil. There's also more enthusiasm in Argentina and a little bit more in Mexico. And then if you go to Region 1, there's a little bit more enthusiasm in China. So all these things add up to what you said.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Okay.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","I appreciate it.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Thank you. Next caller?","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next is from Joe O'Dea of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good morning. In terms of the inventory, and you talked about carrying about half as much as the rest of the industry, we still continue to see the 100-plus horsepower category for the industry come in pretty high. Are you able to give any kind of breakdown for your own inventory levels if we split that 100-plus into the large stuff and the small stuff? So combines are actually at what look like very healthy inventory levels for the industry. Do your large tractors mirror what we would see in combines, and so we can bucket all of the higher inventory levels in the small category? But just to try to understand that important category of tractor where we don't get as much visibility.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Sure. I'm not going to be able to give you specific numbers, but keep in mind large tractors do tend to run a little higher than combines. And some of that's just the significant seasonality of combines and the way we use the early order program versus tractors using the more sequential traditional type of order book. So again, you do see generally a little higher level of orders. But what I would say is, similar to what we said in the past, really what is driving that elevated level would be what we would consider midsize livestock-oriented machines that are in that kind of 100-horsepower to 200-horsepower. It's not what we would consider large Ag in the 220-plus range. Those are in very, very good shape from a new inventory level perspective.","Again, keep in mind, as you move into lower horsepower ranges, you also have a bit of a shift in our stocking strategy. So we've talked about on the very small stuff, we tend to run with higher levels of inventory as a percent of sales simply because those tend to be a bit more of an impulse buy. And then as you move into that midsize, certain products within that midsize range are going to mirror a little bit closer to what we have with small Ag, and others are going to mirror more what we do \u2013 lean more towards what we do with large Ag. So you do get a little bit of mix there as well, and so that's really what is driving those levels.","We are moving some of those midsize livestock-oriented type of products, is where we're seeing most of the inventory reduction in the year that's forecast. But again, I think generally you see a little bit higher stocking strategy on those versus the very large equipment. So hopefully that helps, but let's go ahead and move on to the next caller.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","It does, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Steven Fisher of UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning. From a timing perspective, you're forecasting roughly flat revenues in the first half on the equipment side. That would imply you have upwards of 8% revenue growth in the second half. You talked to Jamie about some of the visibility you have in the orders on the construction side. What's the visibility you have on the Ag side in getting to that overall strong growth in the second half of the year?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","As you think about \u2013 again, we've talked about this quite often. In North America, we certainly have our best visibility. And so when you think about large Ag in particular in North America, we do, as I just mentioned, have early order programs on combines and other seasonal equipment. So certainly that combine early order program in most years is 90-plus percent of our annual production. That ended during our first quarter, and so we have very good visibility on combines. I'll assume the next question on that will be how did it end? So I'll go ahead and give you that now.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Sure.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","And we did on combines ended up single digit year over year, and again, I think it's reflective \u2013 a couple questions ago someone mentioned the combine inventory position, and that certainly is reflected in that strong sales.","On large tractors, again, we run a more of a traditional sequential order book. And there I would say, as you look at our 7R, 8R, and 9R tractors, it's a mix, but generally in line year over year from an availability perspective. So what we mean there is if a customer comes in today and orders a tractor, when would that next availability be. So some are a little further out year over year, some are a little closer. 8Rs, for example, are actually a little behind from an availability perspective, three to four weeks. Last year it would have been end of May, early June, and this year availability is early May. But then you look at things like 7R tractors, and they're a few weeks ahead, as are some of the 9R tractors, so again, in general, running very much in line.","So I would say our visibility is pretty good and our order book is very comparable year-over-year in terms of what we're seeing today versus the forecast that we have in place. So again, I think we'll obviously have even better visibility next quarter, but on large Ag pretty good visibility for the year.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Next is from Lawrence De Maria of William Blair. Your line is open.","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks. Good morning, Tony, guys.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Hi, Larry.","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","In North America, specifically some of your competition has been having some issues with their distribution. And I'm just curious, how you would view your distribution vis-\u00e0-vis the competition in terms of stress levels? And I'm assuming it's in better shape obviously. And just kind of curious what kind of market share changes or programs you might be running to take advantage of the situation and your relative health? And then just on the last question you just answered, can you give a large tractor percentage like you did for combines? Thanks.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Again, we don't comment in terms of the order book specifically on tractor because it's simply a different type of ordering program in terms of not using an early order program. But as it relates to the dealers, our dealer distribution especially in North America on the Ag side and the Construction as well, for that matter, is actually in very good shape. As we've done a lot of work in recent years, with that dealer network seen a lot of consolidation. Generally, those dealers of tomorrow in particular, their margins are very strong. They utilize parts and service to really cover a significant portion of their fixed cost, which help them as they go through leaner complete goods years, like we're seeing over the last several years. And so that's really helped us maintain again a very, very strong dealer network.","One of the things we've talked about, as you go through a downturn, often it does provide a good market share opportunity for us as we tend to manage our inventories much better than the competition. So we're in a better position that way. Our dealers tend to be much stronger. We've had additional investment in product, so really expanding that technology gap between our product and customers. So when you do see that market returning, generally that's again some of our best market share opportunities. And we would expect the same to occur as we go into future years here.","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","So would that be factored into this year, Tony? Or would that provide upside if you're able to take advantage in the downturn this year?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Certainly we would have that factored in. And I think as you look at our sales versus the sum total of the guidance that we have for industry, I think certainly that's reflected in those numbers, so.","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Yep. Next caller?","Operator","Next is from Michael Shlisky of Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Just want to go back to your comments earlier on the livestock industry. It's only been a few quarters of some kind of weak trends here. Do you think we're kind of seeing the early innings of a multiyear down swing in the livestock world at this time, or is it just more of a temporary blip? And I know you have some kind of new midsize tractor refreshes this year. Is it possible that if we do see a down swing, Deere might gain some share with some of your newer products out there, just kind of fit that 100 horsepower, 110 horsepower range?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Certainly when you bring out new product you always hope that that drives some market share gain. Livestock again, I think you've certainly seen some higher margins, especially through the fall months. You're going get a varying range of what could happen as you move through the year. But I think, as many people are aware, we do use Informa economics as an external consultant there. And generally, I think they would see the feeder cattle market seeing some improvement in margins as we go into 2017. Again, not forecasting the very, very strong margins that we saw a couple years ago, but certainly seeing some improvement.","Same thing really for the pork industry. Poultry has remained pretty positive although as production has increased, you see a little bit of erosion in some of those margins. But, again, staying positive. I think, what I would point out is, across the board, on all of those commodities, there is a healthy level of export demand anticipated for U.S. producers. And I think that's probably one of the bigger questions is, does that export market actually happen or not. And so, if you want to point to risk, I think there would be \u2013 that would be the major one we would point to, but certainly today in the forecast, we would anticipate margins to stabilize and maybe even slightly improve across the complex. Okay.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thanks, Tony.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you.

I mean I think as you think about Europe from an inventory perspective, certainly not a major concern there. I mean used in pockets would be elevated. Places like the UK with exchange, sliding a bit there. Actually it's helped the used equipment market. That was the area we previously had been pointing to with some elevated used, but you'll see pockets there. But from a new side, actually pretty good shape from an inventory perspective.","It's a market that's kind of languished a bit over the last several years in terms of slight up, slight down throughout the region, and really kind of forecasting that as we move through the year. Now one of the positive signs, as Josh pointed out, is dairy now after a year, a year-and-a-half of really having some \u2013 creating some headwind in that market appears in current forecast anyway to maybe be seeing some recovery. Now that likely isn't going to drive equipment until maybe later in the year, but really into 2018 assuming that that recovery continues.","So again, as usual, kind of pockety, but inventory largely is not really a concern from that perspective. Thank you.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Next caller?","Operator","Yes. Next question is from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Hey, Adam.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","I was wondering if we could go back to Construction & Forestry outlook. I'm curious if a pickup in demand from the rental channel is what has been driving the improvement in the order book recently? And then related to that, have you changed your pricing assumptions at all for C&F this year with the dealer inventories getting weak and it sounds like with the strong orders, has that been a component of the forecast increase?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Yeah. Certainly rental I think for us with some of the new product, especially in the compact equipment, is certainly a positive year-over-year. We've talked about things like our skid steer loader that's new this year, that we talked about that really at original budget. So that certainly is a part of the sales for Deere in that regard.","Pricing, keep in mind that's less a function of an inventory issue for us. The negative pricing that we saw last year was not driven by our dealers having excess inventory. It was simply the competitive environment where in order to get sales, we were losing market share early in the year and had to ramp up discounting in order to protect some of that. So I think it's a little early yet to anticipate any improvement from a competitive perspective. Certainly we're hopeful that that would happen, but that would not have been part of the change in our outlook from original budget. Okay, thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next is from Brett Wong of Piper Jaffray & Company. Your line is open.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","You bet.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Have you started to see any increased lending in Brazil? And on the government credit availability, do you see any risk to where funds are going to come from? And any thoughts around kind of rates moving lower for Moderfrota there? Also do you see any risk to demand in Brazil given the strengths of the reais impacting some farmer profitability? Thanks.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Yeah. I think broadly as our outlook would anticipate, we continue to see strength and strengthening markets in South America including Brazil. Profitability, while FX may have some impact, certainly is still very positive there. From a FINAME perspective, there's always risk. I think the risk is always greater when you think beyond June, when you move into the next fiscal year in particular. And to your point there's actual opportunity there as well as the overall market rate has come down. I think there is some speculation that there could be some pressure to reduce the Moderfrota rate as we go forward. We'll see what happens there.","From a funding perspective, I think the government continues to be very supportive of agriculture. We've seen that, as Josh mentioned. We've already seen them at 50% to the original budget for Moderfrota, and what we've been told is their commitment remains and to the extent there's need for additional funding, that it will be available. So again, I think history would tell us that something that they have supported in the past. So hopefully, we'll continue to see that support as we go forward. Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. Next is from Robert Wertheimer of Barclays Capital. Your line is open.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you, good morning. Tony, just to clarify on your comments on how far you're out on the 7s, 8s, and 9s, that assumes a flat underlying production rate, and you're a few weeks ahead, a few weeks behind. Is that how I should interpret that?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","That is no. because that implies a production rate in line with what our forecast is.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","What your forecast is, okay.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","That's a very good clarification. It does not necessarily imply that we're \u2013 even if we've same availability that you have flat sales year over year, they could be higher, they could be lower.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Exactly. Okay, perfect. And then on commissions paid to dealers, maybe I missed it, but I think that's a new disclosure. Is that a new business practice? What exactly does that mean? Is there something shifting in the market where dealers want you to coordinate with big farmers more directly, or maybe it's on the used trade-in more directly. What exactly does that imply, if anything?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","There are some markets where we do have a little higher level of direct sales to large and very large customers. Brazil would be a market that we would highlight in particular. We have talked about commissions to dealers in the past, and it's usually in environments like this, where you're seeing sales in Brazil really elevated. And so again, in order to compensate our dealers as those sales go directly there are commissions paid to those, those instead of being booked as part of our net sales, actually accounting rules would require us to book those as SA&G in again sales commission. So that's largely what's driving it. You see it a little bit in U.S. and Canada. But again, mostly what you're seeing in the quarter was driven by Brazil.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it, thanks.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Yes, thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. Next is from Mig Dobre of Robert W. Baird & Company. Your line is open.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes, thank you. Good morning. So growth is very much back half weighted for your guidance. I'm trying to see if you can give us a little bit of color as to how we should be thinking about margin progression sequentially, or maybe operating income, however you want to frame it, first half versus second half. And also associated with this, have you made any changes to your raw material assumption for the year?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Generally, again, as you would expect, as you move through the year \u2013 and I'm looking at total equipment operations, second and third quarter tends to be our stronger margin quarters. And then we start to see that come off in the fourth quarter, first quarter being as usual the lowest margin quarter. So again, not a significant shift in that breakdown as you move through the year. Again, I'd point out, some years, second and third quarter often compete for which one is the higher margin quarter. But, again, that would be the progression.","On a raw material perspective, certainly commodity prices have risen a bit in the quarter from \u2013 it actually came down a bit and then back up. But we're still forecasting, I'd say in some cases slight headwind, but really mostly flattish. When you consider the offset of the cost reduction programs that we have in place, those elevated commodity prices are being offset, so really not a significant change from original budget. Okay, next caller?","Operator","Thank you. Next is from Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Hi, Seth.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I just wanted to go back to the pricing question \u2013 or the pricing discussion. Pricing was up 2% in the first quarter. You're guiding to 2% in the second quarter, but full year is only up 1%. Is that just some conservatism, or are you seeing something out there in the order book that's causing you to think second half pricing will be softer? Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Keep in mind, first quarter is, again, a very light quarter, and rarely do you see the first quarter drive the full year. Some of that gets into comps year over year as you think about the progression. But again, as you think about pricing, we've talked about over the last several years, even when it's been a point, it's been closer to 1.5 points, and that wouldn't be unique this year versus some of the other years. So again, what we'll see as we go through the year how that pricing works out. And as we talked about earlier, what happens with C&F could drive some of that as well, if the market's competitive environment lessens up a bit, I think that's where we would hope at some point we would see some better pricing.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Okay, next caller?","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next is from Sebastian Kuenne of Berenberg Bank. Your line is open.","Sebastian Kuenne - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Good morning, gentlemen. We all know that the farmer expectations for future income is really bullish since November. So the Midwestern farmers are very positive on the outlook. So I think this might translate also to the dealers becoming a bit more positive. So when you say that the pre-orders are shooting up, is that really orders from the end farmer that the farmer purchase and order these large equipment, or is it more restocking with the dealers? Do you see a difference in Q1 this year compared to last year?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","It's a good point and one to always keep in mind. What I would tell you is, on the combine early order program, there is a mix there every year between retail and some dealer order for stock. The mix this year is very consistent with what we saw a year ago. And similarly on our large tractors, it would be a very similar mix. So the short answer is no, it's not increased orders that should be implied to see just inventory increases. It's again, a similar mix between retail and stock, with the heavier on a large Ag equipment, a heavier mix \u2013 much heavier mix towards retail versus stock. Okay, thank you. Next caller?","Sebastian Kuenne - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Just a quick follow-up, but it's true that last year the focus was more on destocking with your dealers, whereas this year the trend is more towards restocking?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Again, what we're not doing is under-producing to retail. So last year we would \u2013 yeah, so again, I would say inventory levels, other than the fact that we have the ability to produce to retail, is not really a story, if you will, in terms of our orders year over year. Okay. Next caller?","Sebastian Kuenne - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Thank you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next is from Nicole Deblase of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. Good morning. So I want to ask about the Construction & Forestry margin guidance. I know you guys had a 150 basis point headwind from sales incentives during the first quarter, and I guess I'm curious, does that completely go away in 2Q and beyond? I'm just trying to think of the cadence of C&F margins throughout 2017.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Certainly as you get into the back-half of the year, the comp gets much easier. Now I guess I should point out in second quarter, remember, because we increased our outlook for discounting, there was the accrual bumped-up in the second quarter. So that does create I guess an easier comp in the second quarter. But as you think about sequentially pricing in the end market we would hope becomes more consistent as we move through the back-half of the year. But really, a little bit higher material costs, not so much from materials being purchased in the U.S. so much, but some higher emissions-related costs.","And remember, we do purchase \u2013 we have some partner products that come from Japan. Some of those yen-based products on excavators, the exchange is creating some higher costs year-over-year there. And again, the negative price realization is really what's driving from a negative side some of the lower margins in C&F so.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it, thanks.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Thank you, and we'll take one last call.","Operator","Yes. Our last question is from Joel Tiss, BMO. Your line is open.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Most of them have been answered. I don't know if you talked about the warranty, why it was up so much. And I just wanted to add on that, the cost cutting, is that pretty much all just head count reduction? Or is there anything else in there? Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","Yeah. I'll start with warranty and I'll let Raj handle the cost reduction. But really if you think about that warranty that was identified for Ag in the quarter, again, I would emphasize first quarter is a relatively low quarter, so changes tend to be magnified a bit more than they would be certainly in things like our second and third quarter. But it was in part due to a change in our Service Parts Warranty program. So in the U.S. and Canada, our parts for Ag & Turf in the past would have been 90-day warranty. That has shifted to a full year for Ag parts and six months on Turf parts. So obviously, when you make those changes, again, there's an accrual for all of the service parts that are already at a dealer in dealer inventory, and that accrual rate goes up for all of those. And so that's reflected in the quarter that the change is made and you're seeing that reflected this quarter.","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","And, Joel, your question on structural cost reduction, which bucket it's coming from, we have said in the past, material costs, direct and indirect, would be about 40% of that and people-related costs about 20%. And then there are a lot of other areas like R&D and lower depreciation that constitute the rest. So I would say people-related costs is definitely delivering as we anticipated, so is the material costs. If you recall on the material costs we said that structural cost reduction we're aiming for is about 2.5%, but we allow for 1.5 points of material inflation and FX, and net of only 1 point is included in the structural cost reduction goal of over $500 million. So that is also yielding results as we anticipated.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just a quick \u2013 sorry. Why would you have to take a charge for raw material cost-related reductions?","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","It's just simply as we did the calculation from a practical perspective, we assumed there would be some commodity inflation that would be more than offset by the cost-reduction project. That's not uncommon for us historically as you see inflationary periods here and there. And so, it was a way to make sure that we really were looking at this on a net-basis, not a gross-basis from a cost reduction perspective as it relates to material so.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, thank you very much.","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Deere & Co.","And again, we'll conclude our call.

Brent?","Brent Norwood","John Deere had another solid quarter with contributions from both our equipment operations and financial services group. The strong performance has enabled significant investment in new products, services and technologies as well as a return of $1.8 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks.","In agricultural markets, replacement demand continues to drive sales activity for our early order programs; while construction equipment sales benefited from increased construction investment and a healthy order book.","Now let's take a closer look at our year end results for 2018 beginning on Slide 3. For the full year, net sales in revenues were up 26%, to $37.358 billion, while net sales for equipment operations were up 29% to $33.351 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $2.368 billion or $7.24 per diluted share.","The results for the year included an unfavorable net adjustment to provisional income taxes of $704 million; excluding this item adjusted net income was $3.073 billion.","Slide 4 shows the results for the fourth quarter. Net sales and revenues were up 17% to $9.4 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $785 million or $2.42 per diluted share. The results for the quarter included a favorable net adjustment to provisional income taxes of $37 million. Excluding this item adjusted net income was $748 million.","On Slide 5, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 18% to $8.3 billion; price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation was negative by 3 points. The impact of Wirtgen was 11 points.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses starting with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 6. Net sales were up 3% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison primarily driven by higher shipment volumes and price realization partially offset by the negative impact of currency. Operating profit was $567 million down 5% from the same quarter last year as the benefit of increased volumes and price realization were balanced by higher production cost, currency headwinds and increased R&D expense. Operating margins for the quarter were 10.1%.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at some fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 7 outlines that U.S. principle crop cash receipts, an important indicator for equipment demand, through 2019, principal crop cash receipts are estimated to be up about $120 billion roughly flat with 2018. Record yields and higher prices for corn are forecasted to offset softness in soybean prices. Additionally improved prices for cotton and wheat continue to be supportive of crop cash receipts as well.","It's also important to note that the receipts include about $4 billion representing the first tranche in the USDA aid distributed to farmers. To-date just under a billion has already been paid out in 2018.","On Slide 8, corn stocks-to-use ratio is expected to decline in response to increasing global demand and drought conditions experienced during the first crop in Argentina, which lowered the country's corn production by roughly 25%. Wheat stock-to-use ratio is projected to decline in 2018 in response to intensifying drought conditions in Europe, Australia and the Black Sea region, as a result, U.S. farmers are seeing increasing export demand for the year.","Conversely soybean stocks-to-use ratio is forecast to build in response to higher than expected yields in the U.S., and the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Over the last six months there's been much uncertainty as to how China would source soybeans and where displaced U.S. exports would go. While trade flow patterns are still in process of rerouting, it is possible that we could see Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay ship the majority of their exports to China, in addition to a draw down of Chinese stocks and use of protein substitutions.","In that scenario, U.S. soybean exports would likely increase to the former trading partners of South America and result in some building of stocks in 2018. We expect farmer sentiment continue to be fluid as trade flow patterns continue to adjust.","At this point, I'd like to welcome to the call, John Lagemann, the Ag & Turf, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing for the Americas. He will provide comments on the current environment for Ag in North and South America as well as the 2019 industry outlook for the Ag & Turf division. John?","John Lagemann","Thanks Brent.","Moving on to Slide 9, let's focus on the current backdrop for North American large ag including farmer sentiment, replacement demand and the status of our 2019 early order program.","Over the past several months, I've traveled extensively meeting with both dealers and farmers and I've had a chance to discuss general business conditions and their outlook for next year. In the U.S., overall both farmer and dealer sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. While there is uncertainty in the soybean market, there is optimism around improved fundamentals that Brent just referenced in the corn, wheat and cotton markets.","In addition, we're seeing notable excitement from dealers and customers in our core Midwest markets concerning the 2018 crop where there are record yields in both corn and soybeans. Dealers believe this crop will positively influence equipment demand for 2019. But despite this optimism, it is also important to acknowledge the ongoing uncertainty the industry faces regarding unresolved global trade issues. While many farmers believe these issues will be resolved before next year's harvest there's no doubt trade concerns have had an impact on farmer sentiment over the last several months.","Now let's talk specifics on the industry and the reasons for our constructive view for 2019, which reflect the following four aspects: number one, we are in a replacement market; number two, replacement demand is being augmented by today's precision ag technology; number three, our approach in delivering this technology is uniquely and seamlessly integrated. And finally, the initial response to our 2019 early order programs has been supportive of our view.","Now let's take a closer look at these drivers. First, it is still a replacement market that's because the fleet age has reached its highest point since 2013. And customers are increasingly citing a need for newer equipment due to hours and the age on their machines. Further to the second point, we see evidence that replacement demand is being amplified by the latest precision technology with many examples across our entire large Ag portfolio. And through the course of my conversations with customers the last few months, it is clear these advanced technologies are driving operational efficiencies and the tangible economic values.","Also evident in the growth of our advanced technologies is the critical role being provided by Deere\u2019s proprietary and foundational precision technologies such as guidance, telematics, onboard computing and our digital operations center all of which represent up to 20 years of investment. These foundational elements serve as key enablers for our latest advanced technologies and the combination creates the most differentiated and integrated solution in the marketplace. Deere's advantage in this area is further enhanced by the unmatched capabilities of our dealer organization delivering these solutions.","Let's start with product support which is fundamental to our strategy because it ensures our customers get the most performance and uptime from their equipment perhaps the best example is a feature we call John Deere Connected Support, which allows us to remotely help customers monitor their equipment through integrated telematics. We deploy this strategy two years ago and it is now included in the base package for all of our self-propelled large ag equipment.","Through John Deere Connected Support, we deploy expert alerts which route predictive maintenance alerts through Deere systems to the local dealer. This allows dealers to proactively contact customers before predicted failure occurs and expedite the repair. This is just one example, but in general our dealers are centralizing their service capabilities so they could take full advantage of the technology we bring to the equipment in order to prevent downtime and maximize our customer's equipment investments.","Overall, our dealers also play a critical role in the adoption of precision ag by our customers. Many of our large Ag dealers now employ certified agronomists and are beginning to mainstream precision ag expertise across their dealerships with the intent of helping customers plan and execute their astronomic decisions.","Importantly our dealers are making significant investments in both product support and precision ag capabilities. Deere's dealer advantage in this area distinguishes our channel in the industry. Furthermore, we firmly believe a successful precision ag strategy requires a substantial investment from both the OEM and the channel as well as significant collaboration between these two parties. And we are committed to doing just that.","I came across an example of why this is so important just last month was visiting with a very large Midwestern farmer, who is in fact in the process of converting from a multicolored fleet to all green. He cited the economic advantages of utilizing an all green fleet across his entire production system from planting, spraying and harvesting, all leveraging the same integrated technology and seamless data platform and equally as important for this customer was the local dealers ability to supply and support the advanced technologies of this entire fleet.","This example also highlights how our strong dealer network has been critical in facilitating replacement demand seen in '18 and continuing into 2019 with the latest results of our early order programs, which I will speak to now. In September, the final phase of the planter and sprayer early order program concluded with orders up mid-single digits over 2018.","In addition to higher volume year-over-year, the program included a healthy price increase and resulted in materially higher take rates for advanced precision features like ExactApply sprayers and ExactEmerge planters which were up significantly from last year.","Moving to our combine early order program results through phase two are mixed with volume ending up in the U.S. but down in Canada largely due to a delayed harvest in some other weather-related issues. Importantly, adoption rates for premium features like active yield and Combine Advisor were both higher than last year. Overall replacement demand continues to drive order activity and we are pleased with the initial response to our early order programs. Furthermore, the 2019 large tractor order book is building and currently running into the second quarter.","Customer demand to-date supports our expectations of a continued gradual recovery for large ag equipment in North America, which is still closer to trough volumes than mid-cycle. Key to this gradual recovery is either the continuation of trade flow readjustments which we have seen already some progress in or a trade resolution between the U.S. and China.","Turning to Slide 10, I'd like to elaborate on Deere's journey in Brazil and provide insights into the current environment. Deere began its Brazilian operation in 1979 with a 20% acquisition of SLC and the production of combines only. By the 1990s, we foresaw the country's enormous ag potential and began investing heavily in the region. Launched our financial operations and established the region's preeminent dealer channel. Over the last decade, Deere has tripled its tractor market share and now enjoys the leading brand position.","We've also localized the complete soybean production system portfolio including tractors, planters, sprayers and combines, while achieving very attractive margins. Further augmenting this complete production system portfolio is our best-in-class distribution channel and Deere's latest precision ag offerings, which also lead the industry and further widened our competitive advantage.","After recently traveling to Brazil this month and visiting with both dealers and customers I can report the environment in Brazil is quite positive with farmer sentiment boosted by recent election results and the outlook for expanding acreage. Despite some modest near-term pressure on freight and input prices, we remain very optimistic on the region's long-term prospects and we'll continue to execute our product technology and channel strategy.","By region, our 2019 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 11. Industry sales in the U.S. are forecast to be flat to up 5% for 2019. As I mentioned already expectations for the year are largely driven by replacement demand as customers need to update their age fleets and upgrade to more efficient technologies. Further supporting new equipment demand used inventories are down over one-third from their peak in 2014, while pricing has remained stable with good low hour Deere machines selling quickly and bringing strong prices.","As mentioned, Midwest dealers are reporting the high yields of this fall's crop should have a positive impact on equipment demand particularly as customers begin reviewing their tax scenarios. For our small ag segment, compact tractor show a strong order book for 2019 driven by a healthy economy and GDP growth. This is helping to offset softness for our livestock and dairy customers, although the order bank for utility tractors and round bailers has been very solid.","Moving on to the EU 28, the industry outlook is forecast to be flat in 2019; our strength in the U.K. and France is offsetting weather-related challenges in northern Germany and Scandinavia. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be flat to up 5% for the year. This is primarily driven by solid industry fundamentals in Brazil which is benefiting from a positive reaction to the political election, commodity price premiums and expanding acreage opportunities. However, growth in Argentina is likely to remain challenged in the near-term as the country battles high inflation and political uncertainty.","Shifting to Asia, industry sales are expected to be flat to down slightly as key growth markets begin to cool. Lastly, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in '19, based on the general economic factors mentioned earlier.","Putting all of this together on Slide 12, fiscal year 2019 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be up approximately 3%, which includes a negative currency impact of about two points. Furthermore, we anticipate sales in '19 to mirror a similar quarterly seasonality as we saw in 2018.","The Ag & Turf Division operating margin is forecast to be up approximately 12.5%.","I'll now turn it back over to Brent.","Brent Norwood","Thanks.","Let's focus on construction and forestry on Slide 13, net sales for the quarter of $2.7 billion were up 65% compared with last year driven by strong demand for construction and forestry equipment as well as by the acquisition of Wirtgen, which contributed 45% of the positive improvement. Fourth quarter operating profit was $295 million largely benefiting from the Wirtgen acquisition, higher shipment volumes and net price realization partially offset by higher production costs. C&F operating margins were 10.8% for the quarter, about 10.9% excluding Wirtgen.","Moving to Slide 14, the economic environment for the construction, forestry and road building industries looks solid and continue to support increased demand for new and used equipment. For 2019, U.S. GDP in total construction investment are forecast to grow, while housing starts and oil activity remain at supportive levels for equipment demand. Importantly, our U.S. customer base remains quite optimistic on next year's prospects citing backlogs extending through much of the year.","Lastly, global transportation investment this year is forecast to grow about 5% driving increased demand for road construction equipment such as milling machines, rollers and asphalt pavers, which are all important product lines for Wirtgen. These positive economic indicators are reflected in a strong order book which is now extending about six months into 2019.","Moving to the C&F outlook on Slide 15, Deere's construction and forestry sales are now forecast to be up about 15% in 2019 as a result of stronger demand for equipment as well as an additional two months of ownership of Wirtgen. The net sales forecast includes about $3.8 billion attributable to Wirtgen. The forecast for global forestry market is up about 10% as a result of improvement in sales in the U.S. and Canada and strong demand for [cutter linked] [ph] products in Europe and Russia.","C&F's full year operating margin is projected to be about 12% excluding Wirtgen C&F projects operating margins to be about 11.5%. With regards to Wirtgen integration continues to go as planned and the business is enjoying healthy backlogs and performing to the high-end of our expectations. Operating margins are now forecast to be about 14% for 2019.","Let's move now through our financial services operations. Slide 16 shows the provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average owned portfolio. The financial forecast for 2019 shown on the slide contemplates a loss provision of about 17 basis points, 4 basis points higher than 2018. This would put loss provisions for the year below the 10-year average of 23 basis points and the 15-year average of 24 basis points.","Moving to Slide 17. Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $261 million in the fourth quarter. The results for the quarter included $109 million of net tax reform related charges arising from the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and deemed earnings repatriation. Excluding tax reform related items, adjusted net income in the fourth quarter was $153 million up about 19% compared to the same quarter last year. For the full year in 2019, net income is forecast to be about $630 million.","Slide 18 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole receivables and inventories ended the year up $3.5 billion. In the C&F division, the majority of the increase is attributable to Wirtgen as well as a higher order book and production schedule for 2019. For ag, the increase is due to better inventory positioning with our supply base and continued demand for small ag products which require adequate inventory to sales ratio.","Moving to Slide 19, cost of sales for the fourth quarter was 76% of net sales and our 2019 guidance is about 75% down two points from 2018. R&D was up about 18% in the fourth quarter and forecast to be up 6% in 2019 or 4% when excluding Wirtgen from the results. The increase in 2019 primarily relates to strategic investments in precision ag as well as next generation new product development programs for large ag product lines.","SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up 8% in the quarter and 15% for the full year on a reported basis. The year-over-year increase is mostly attributable to the impact of acquisitions. Our full year 2019 SA&G forecast expense is up about 7% or 4% excluding Wirtgen.","Turning to Slide 20, equipment operation tax rate was 34% in the fourth quarter, which included an unfavorable adjustment of $72 million arising from tax reform. For 2019, Deere's year full year effective tax rate is projected to be between 25% and 27%.","Slide 21 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $4.8 billion in 2019 up from $3.3 billion in 2018. Keep in mind that 2018 cash flow included about $1.4 billion in voluntary contributions to pension and OPEB.","Company's financial outlook is on Slide 22. Our full year outlook now calls for net sales to be up about 7%. Guidance includes about three points of price realization and two points related to an additional two months of Wirtgen ownership. On the negative side, we expect currency to be about a two point headwind next year.","With respect to cost inflation, we anticipate the price realization forecast in 2019 will offset both material costs and freight inflation experienced in 2018 as well as any additional increases forecasted in 2019. Finally, our full year 2019 GAAP net income forecast is now about $3.6 billion.","I will now turn the call over to Raj Kalathur for closing comments. Raj?","Raj Kalathur","Before we respond to your questions, I'd like to share some thoughts on capital allocation, Deere's ongoing strategy and the long-term tailwinds underpinning our business outlook.","First it's important to know that continued demand for book ag and construction equipment has resulted in excellent cash flow generation and allowed us to increase the capital return to shareholders. In 2018, the company returned almost $1.8 million through an increased dividend and the repurchase of approximately 950 million in stock.","In 2019, we are forecasting a strong $4.8 billion in cash flow from operations. These measures reflect our optimism on the future prospects for the end markets we serve.","With regard to our dividend, we aim to maintain a payout ratio that targets 25% to 35% of mid-cycle earnings and can be sustained through the cycle. Based on our performance in the previous cycle and the inclusion of Wirtgen, we will consider further dividend increases in fiscal year 2019.","Second, in our recent review of the John Deere strategy, we revised our 2022 financial aspirations to reflect our higher expectations for the business. As a result, we raised our mid-cycle operating margin target from 12% to 15% and modified our operating asset turn aspiration to keep us focused on managing assets effectively. These goals reflect our continued drive to make further improvements and overcome headwinds such as currency or inflation.","Also the new goals incorporate Wirtgen's potential contribution and will keep us focused on our successful integration. Furthermore, Deere has a good track record of achieving higher levels of performance, so we are confident the company will quickly drive towards these new aspirations. Importantly, incentive compensation is aligned to these higher goals as you may have already noticed in our last proxy.","Lastly, although global agricultural markets continue to face uncertainty over trade, the underlying fundamentals and tailwinds remain intact. It's important to keep in mind that global demand for grains continue to grow even as trade flows adjust to accommodate changes in government policy and forecasts show demand outpacing supply for the '18\/'19 seasons.","We are encouraged by the level of replacement demand driving sales at the present time and believe our business will continue to benefit from a gradual recovery in the Northern American large ag market and the rapid adoption of precision technologies. As a result, we look forward to delivering strong results in 2019 and beyond.","Josh Jepsen","Now we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on polling procedure. In consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Shirley?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup. You may ask your question.","Tim Thein","Great. Thank you. Good morning. First, thanks to John for the color that was really helpful. Just coming back Raj on what you just finished with in terms of the updated goals, specifically the 15% at mid-cycle operating margin target. The company is -- I don't think has ever hit that just in any year in the past so maybe just obviously that the inclusion of Wirtgen adds a different component to the sales and profit mix from what you've had historically. But maybe if you can just give us some kind of a little more color in terms of what helps to give you confidence in the company's ability to hit that mid cycle margin target just in terms of the -- maybe changes to the cost structure et cetera. So that's my question. Thank you.","Raj Kalathur","Sure, Tim. One, we talked about technology investments we've been making in the last few years and precision ag is an example. These types of technologies and the solutions and the products that come out of these have significant value to the customers and such products should allow us to not only generate higher revenues, higher share, but also much higher margins given the kind of value this will generate for the customer. That's one.","The second would be John talked about Connected Support; these type of technologies that we are incorporating now will help us develop a much higher share of the aftermarket business going forward, okay. This you have to work with the channel and you heard about the investments the channel is making and we are making to enable that. Third, you mentioned Wirtgen, I think the synergies from Wirtgen both on the cost side and the sales side and some of the growth prospects there will also allow us to improve our margins.","Four, the example would be just all the journey that we can do internally in terms of improving efficiency and effectiveness of our operations just leveraging digitalization for example, okay, a small thought would be in shared services and accounting we use robotic process automation. There are so many places we intend to actually use such digitalization technologies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency. And finally, one other example would be, we'll continue to work on direct material cost reduction, indirect material cost reduction and so on that will also yield an additional opportunity for us to improve margins. So those are the types of things we are envisioning. There'll be a lot more like that. So thank you.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good morning. Couple of questions, one just on, can you comment on the ag margins in the quarter. They were I think a little light relative to what you guys had guided and also the margins for the full year for ag for '19 at 12.5% I think the implied incrementals are mid to high 20s, which is a little lighter than I think we were thinking so if you could provide color on that.","And then, my follow-up question is just on the pricing front for 2019, I understand the full -- it's 3%, but can you help us get some better clarity on what -- how we should think about ag versus construction? Thank you.","Brent Norwood","Yes. Jamie when we look at the ag margins and I think it's really a similar story kind of what we saw in 2018 as well as the guide for 2019. FX was a significant headwind in the fourth quarter. We're seeing that carry through into 2019. So when you think about kind of the full year of 2018 about 12.1%, ex FX that's about 12.5%. So we saw some drag there. Similarly as we look at 2019, FX is about a 0.5 drag on our ag margins. So that's been a pretty significant impact over where we were forecasting a quarter ago.","As you think about '19, the other components FX is the biggest piece, we do have the impact of R&D and SA&G, really R&D focused on some of the things that John and Raj mentioned in terms of precision ag as well as next generation large ag products that we think over the long-term help us achieve those ambition goals in terms of margins as well as growing share.","I think those are the major puts and takes embedded in that guide as you noted is the price realization that we've talked about. So we're 3% next year for the equipment operations in total. Both divisions really participating, since we've talked a lot about pricing on large ag John alluded to it. We've seen that on our early order programs, in our order books that are available now. So we feel good about that and our ability to offset the material and freight cost inflation we've seen in '18 and '19.","On the construction side, we put through some discount reductions so we took additional action there that went into effect in November to get price realization on the construction side of the business. And I think it's important to note there we also expect that we're going to get price that offsets the material and cost inflation we are seeing on that side.","So I think that's probably how we look at '19 overall from a margin and price perspective. Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","Thank you. We will go ahead to the next caller.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Seth Weber","Hey, good morning. For Raj, I guess maybe just going back to the capital allocation, as you noted cash from ops is going be up 50% or so this year. I mean is the increase in buyback that you did in the fourth quarter is -- do you feel like that's a decent run rate for us to be thinking about going forward for through 2019? Thanks.","Raj Kalathur","Seth, I think we used the same cash use priorities that we've used in the past. And first, we maintain a mid-single A rating throughout the cycle. We have a strong balance sheet right now to support it. And second, as we'll invest in growth, both organic and inorganic. You've seen as invest in very promising technologies like in precision ag. We also invested in really selectively and adding to areas like Crop Care, the type of company [indiscernible] gain market position or importantly new capabilities. So you'll see us continue to do some of those. And then, you also notice that we've increased dividend by 15% in May 2018 to $0.69 per quarter. We plan to keep the dividends at 25% to 35% of mid-cycle earnings.","Our mid-cycle earnings go up, we'll continue to consider increases. As mentioned earlier, we'll be considering further increases in fiscal '19. And finally, share repurchases, we'll definitely consider if there's cash left and you said $4.8 billion that should leave a lot of cash. But, we'll also be very opportunistic about it. And now with our purchases and time it appropriately in the cycle and we tend to look at the long-term shareholders benefit when we see repurchase shares.","Now, with $4.8 billion, the forecast for next year and the current level of share prices, we think it will be a very good value in terms of share repurchase consideration from a longer term shareholder perspective. I think I will limit it to that right now, Seth.","Seth Weber","Okay. Just I mean, obviously, over the last two quarters, the cadence has picked up fairly materially from where it had been. So, it seems like a natural progression, it seems like this maybe kind of how you are thinking about the run rate going forward. That's all I'm asking. Yes.","Raj Kalathur","I think it's a good statement you made, its worth.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks Seth. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Ann Duignan","Hi. Good morning. I guess my question is for John, I'm just curious frankly your outlook for cash receipts by commodity. What are you contemplating in terms of planted acres by major crop? And the same question. I kind of ask CMH with the North Dakota, South Dakota guys, you've got 12 million acres of soybean this year, with no export program. Is it conceivable that they will take completely out of beans next year and into other crops. I'm just curious what your thoughts are John and what you're hearing out there in the Midwest in terms of planted acres by major crop.","Josh Jepsen","Ann, this is Josh. I'll start and then John will add on. I mean I think as we think about the major crops, I mean certainly a lot of eyes on what this forecast, this harvest is going to look like what happens in South America. I think by and large as we think about, the crop cash receipts, we're seeing -- certainly seeing the benefit of the improvements in corn, cotton and wheat this year in North America. And that probably does drive some shift in acreage out of soybeans, but probably not all to one commodity, some to corn, some to wheat.","I think importantly as you go to South America at least what we're -- what our expectations are now is, you see shift out of corn into cotton, so I think there's going to be a lot of puts and takes as we think about this globally and how farmers -- you make their decisions and think about this from their specific economics as we start planning for next year.","John Lagemann","Yes. And thanks for the question. This is John. I think it's highly dependent upon where it is. I think in those areas that that can grow corn successfully and have grown corn successfully, you'll probably see somewhat of a shift to corn. But I think the point that that Josh made about South America is important because my conversations down there the folks that plant second crop which is a significant piece of the Brazilian ag business, they're leaning heavily towards cotton because of the current conditions and that's going to -- we think provide a buffer on any increased corn here in the U.S. and we're seeing early estimates corn maybe up 3 million to 4 million acres in the U.S. So I'll limit my answer to that.","Josh Jepsen","Thank you. We'll go ahead and move on to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question.","Andy Casey","Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to go back to Jamie's question a little bit. You've been dealing with elevated production costs in Ag & Turf during 2018, first, do those dissipate in 2019? And then the higher R&D, SA&G that you're looking to incur in 2019 should we view that as partially precision ag market development that really should come back in terms of future payback?","Brent Norwood","Yes. I think you're right. Couple of components of higher production costs in '18, certainly material and freight that we've seen as we look at '18 versus '19, we saw a bigger impact in '18 than we were foreseen in '19. And then, when you think about R&D and SA&G, you're exactly right. I mean the large portion of the R&D is focused on precision ag as well as the next generation large ag products. And then, SA&G, there is a significant component there that is related to our customer and product support technology and capabilities and really working seamlessly with our dealer to deliver those solutions. So that's a piece. You've also got down smaller in that some things like incentive comp, some marketing type of things like that but those would be the biggest items.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thanks very much.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Jerry Revich","Hi. Good morning and Happy Thanksgiving everyone. Can you expand on your comments on used inventories in the prepared remarks, so we're hearing about rising used inventories off of a low level or combines and for excavator product line specifically? So can you just talk about what you're seeing in the channel and your comfort level on the construction equipment outlook, strong production growth next year within the context of inventories starting to rise off of the low base but certainly starting to rise.","Brent Norwood","Yes. Thanks Jerry. Starting maybe on used on both sides of the business I think, large ag used we're down a third from the peak of the market. I think importantly we feel good about inventory levels and we've seen prices stabilize. So I think that's some positive on the construction side. We've also continued to see used inventory come down because of the tightness in terms of supply. We've actually seen a number of our dealers putting used into their rental fleets to leverage those machines they have to be able to drive that. So I don't think on the construction side, we've seen any product category be particularly concerning or an issue there. John on the used side\u2026 ","John Lagemann","I think you nailed it on the ag side. We are off third as you said. It's really the lowest point it's been over the last four years. And I think we're in a comfortable zone. If you look at the inventory ratio, so I really have nothing else to add.","Jerry Revich","And that includes [corn] [ph] on John?","John Lagemann","Correct.","Jerry Revich","Yes. All right. Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks Eric. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from David Raso with Evercore. You may ask your question.","David Raso","Thank you. A quick clarification first though, the John Deere strategy, the bumping up the operating margins. Was there any change to your view of mid-cycle revenues in that analysis?","Raj Kalathur","So David as we think through this, we look at '18 through '22 and these are forecasted numbers for the future. And as our business expands you would expect approximate 7-year average to expand as well in terms of sales. So our modeling mid-cycle has not changed in this process, okay? So you would expect '18 or '22 some growth in the mid-cycle.","David Raso","If you even account for the Wirtgen bump up for the margin, you sort of just bumped up your implied EPS mid-cycle by almost $2 and just making sure I understand was that may be as you lower the revenue assumption, so the margin bump is less powerful, but to be clear you're saying you didn't change your view of mid-cycle revenues.","Raj Kalathur","We didn't change our -- I think we didn't change our process to calculate mid-cycle revenue, okay? The mid-cycle revenues will change based on what we post on a yearly basis.","David Raso","Did they go down I guess, Raj. If you held them where they were adding about 200 to 250 bps of core margin improvement, so again exclude the Wirtgen benefit because it's a higher margin business. It does appear you bumped up your implied EPS mid-cycle by almost two dollars. I just want to make sure we understand that is the idea or no, did you lower the revenue assumption while raising the margin, so the benefit not quite as much.","Raj Kalathur","This is kind of -- it might be an endless answer here to answer your question, but we are not going to talk about exactly what the change in EPS is on a year-by-year basis. But what we are not assuming any lower revenues in this process like we said.","David Raso","That's all I think the clarification.","Raj Kalathur","But this is not going to bring things like precision ag. They're going to bring new products additional growth. Wirtgen brings additional growth that our technologies that we talked about brings more growth on the aftermarket side. Like the customer support piece as we've talked about. So this looks at additional growth opportunities and thereby additional margin opportunities.","David Raso","Thanks for that. So real quick, my question is on the guide for Ag & Turf for the year. You're saying organic sales are up 5, but when you back out pricing, it's almost implying volumes are almost not up at all. And given your end market outlook and you obviously sure sounded confident your ability to outgrow the market given all the technology benefits you have. Just trying to understand why are we assuming volumes globally for your business barely up at all in this guidance? That's the final question. Thank you.","Brent Norwood","Yes, David. I think if you look across those the guidance in ag, largely flat, flat to up 5, and I think as John has pointed out, there is uncertainty there. And I think just recognition its early and we want to make sure that we are not giving ahead of ourselves there. But, I think, I wouldn't read too much into that on top of that.","David Raso","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Brent Norwood","Then we have the FX headwind that we talked about that's significant on the top-line.","Josh Jepsen","Thank you, David. Lot more than one question. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Joe O\u2019Dea with Vertical Research Partners. You may ask your question.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Hi, good morning. Just looking for any insight on where we stand on the farm aid payments, you've talked about, how much has been paid so far on the first tranche. But, what's your visibility is into any announcement on a second tranche and so the timing of that the amount of that and how that might be spread across commodities.","Brent Norwood","Thanks Joe. I mean I think as you've noted there's been conversations that there's expectations it could come out December, similar amount. I think probably importantly, as we think about that, we're seeing as noted and some of that payment come out quicker. So the expectation we see some of that come through maybe more here in the next month or two on the first tranche. So we'll see the timing of that but announcement in December. You could see that in the first couple of months then of calendar '19.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. You may your question.","Courtney Yakavonis","Hi. Thanks. Just wanted to get some clarification on the margin guidance for A&G and for C&F next year? Do those, how much headwind are you guys assuming from the Section 232 and 301 tariff and are you assuming the 25% goes into that?","Brent Norwood","Yes. Great question, Courtney. So I think -- when you think about steel overall, we're seeing higher -- we saw a bigger impact in 2018 than we do in 2019. Couple of things that play there. If you think about hot-rolled coil on the ag side of the business, our fourth quarter is kind of where we saw the higher level of steel pricing and we've actually -- that's what we forecast as we look into 2019. So we're -- at a more elevated fuel level as it comes down as this forecasts that would be beneficial.","On the C&F side, plate steel has actually been higher and we've not really seen that move a whole lot. So that's in our forecast. But it appears to look like it'll stay at higher levels throughout the year. So I mean '18, '19 all in, '18 is a little bit higher, we're seeing that impact in '19. I think importantly we're getting price in both divisions to offset that inflation.","As you think about the 301 tariff. So we've estimated about 100 million to 125 million for the enterprise across the year in 2019 and that's at the 25% level. And what our teams would tell you is they're working really hard on that with suppliers and negotiations to go to try to beat that number, but that's what we've got embedded in the forecast, is 100 million to 125 million.","Josh Jepsen","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. You may ask your question.","Mig Dobre","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I just want to talk about C&F a little bit. You talked about order book extending six months into 2019. Can you frame that? And then, on your implied core growth of 12, can you help us understand how you're thinking about Wirtgen versus your legacy construction business? Thanks.","Raj Kalathur","Yes. So I think when we think about the order book, yes, we talk about -- we've got 6 months of orders in hand that's well beyond what we typically run somewhere a month two to less than two on a regular basis. So quite a bit more visibility that's really just based on orders we're seeing come in the backlog of work that our contractors have.","I think when we step back and look at the economic indicators affecting that industry they are still supportive. You think about -- like I mentioned in the backlog, housing has been continued to be supportive. And so I think that's been positive rental utilization. Rental rates have been strong. So I think that's what is driving and informing that outlook.","As we think about legacy C&F versus Wirtgen. I think Wirtgen as we talked about and I think Brent mentioned about $3.8 billion of sales next year. So solid growth healthy backlog there underlying that is about 5% growth expectation in global transportation, road transportation spending. I think that's positive as well.","So I think not all of those factors kind of economic drivers are what would be forming the forecast there and we feel good about where that's at right now.","Josh Jepsen","So thanks. We'll go ahead and move on to the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Steve Fisher with UBS. You may ask your question.","Steve Fisher","Thanks. Good morning. I wonder if you could talk about the 30% increase in CapEx roughly that you're planning for 2019. What's in that? How tight is that to some of the things you mentioned on R &D? And how much maybe incremental depreciation is flowing through 2019 net income as a result of that higher CapEx?","Raj Kalathur","Yes, Steve. When we think about CapEx. It's really it is as you noted a similar story to R&D in that we're focused on advancing our capabilities and precision ag large ag products, the next generation I think in our view, we've got an opportunity to extend our leadership position and continue to move forward there. So that's really what we're doing. And I think those would be the biggest components of that increased spend.","Steve Fisher","Yes. I was just going to ask the clarification about the incremental depreciation flowing through into 2019, net income as a result of that 30% increase.","Raj Kalathur","Yes. I think it's up less than 100 million. If you look at Slide 26, it's about 75 million of increased D&A next year.","Steve Fisher","Okay, perfect. Thanks a lot.","Josh Jepsen","All right. Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. You may ask your question.","Rob Wertheimer","Hi. Thanks and good morning. My question is just on the volume contribution from precision ag features and options. How much is that contributing to volume this year and do you have any comment has been on our penetration rates overall and what the potential contribution to that feature set is, whether it's 10% increase in your volumes or 5 or 20 or what?","Raj Kalathur","Rob, we haven't sized that exactly what I tell you is, it is impactful, when we think about things like ExactEmerge and ExactApply. We're seeing those up significantly from a take rate perspective over a year ago. In some cases 50% increase in the take rates there. Similarly on the combined side, where we're seeing combine advisor and active yield be extremely high penetration rates and adoption. So we've been in it, so it's difficult to decide what does that mean towards our top-line. But we think it is part of the impact there. And it also helps our ability to get price because of the value and economic value we create for the customers.","And I will let John\u2026","John Lagemann","I think that's the main thing. It's because it's really integrated into the product. I think it's hard to measure the incremental value of it, but it really helps sell the value of the product. So I think that's the main perspective.","Raj Kalathur","Yes. So I think Rob that doesn't probably answer your question perfectly, but I think at this point we say, it is impactful and as noted by our investments and our new capital, we think it'll continue to be more important and as we go forward.","Josh Jepsen","Thank you. We'll go ahead and jump to the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Chad Dillard","Hi. Good morning everyone. Just wanted to dig into the inventory increase that you saw exiting that year for [A&G] [ph]. I just want to understand the mix between large and small ag, and then, how are you thinking about Deere inventories exit in 2019?","And then, secondly, maybe you can just comment on how you're seeing the dealer channel evolve and how you expecting that to exit the year.","Raj Kalathur","I think Chad, when we think about the working capital and where we ended the year up what we'd expected. Earlier this year, it's really driven by a few things. One is kind of timing and weather. So later harvest has certainly impacted some of the timing of when we would expect things to retail. So that's been a significant impact. You've also got small ag there, where we're building inventory. It's important in terms of the customer purchase patterns that we've got inventory to sales and availability throughout the year. So that's a piece.","And then, lastly, we're in a much better position with our supply base now than we were a year ago. So last year we did not have as much a part in component availability and this year, we're in a much better position that allows us to go into '19 producing more effectively and efficiently as we move forward. But I'll ask John to add a comment.","John Lagemann","I think I'd add two things Josh. Number one the small tractor and small ag is a strategic play for us because of the focus we're putting on that market. And I think on the large ag piece, it's really timing and the reason I say that is because when you look at November retail sales, frankly they're up significantly over 2018. So I think the late harvest made it more of a timing issue. So we're very encouraged by the early sales in November as we look at 2019.","Josh Jepsen","Yes, Chad. I think overall -- your comment of kind of where do we end with field inventory. I think that's where we feel like at a hundred horsepower plus a combine slightly higher inventory sales where we're a year ago. And again as John pointed out, we think some of that's just timing of when those retails are occurring.","So thank you. We'll go ahead and take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Ross Gilardi","Yes. Thanks guys for squeezing me in. So the feedback from our dealer survey last week, the dealers gathering $2000 to $3000 of annual subscription revenue from customers if not more on a cumulative basis from all of your various precision ag technologies. Last quarter you talked about 130,000 connected ag machines. So if you just multiply $3000 as sub-revenue times 130,000 machines, it get them nearly $400 million in revenue. And then, some of these things you seem to be charging activation fees. You've got other hardware revenue streams. Is it unreasonable to think that precision ag is a $500 million revenue business for Deere today, if not larger at substantially higher margins than the rest of the company. And where are you accounting for that subscription revenue base. Is it in your 300 basis points of pricing or is it somewhere else? Thanks.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. Thanks Ross. It's a big picture right now. We know we're not at the level where we want to break that out in terms of that business in one. It's particularly -- it's not easy to break out because of the integration but we do think it's really important. I think as we go forward, we'll continue to dig in to that and provide more color, but at this point you really -- you do see that -- you think about monetization in the base equipment and premium features, and then in those subscriptions. So we think it's a significant opportunity to create value for customers and we think as we do that we're going to be able to participate in that value.","Ross Gilardi","It is buried inside of just your volumes or is it in the pricing or is it on top of the pricing the 300 basis points of pricing that you're forecasting this year.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. It's really a combination. There is components of the hardware that would be in base and there's other things that would come through your premium features. So it's a little bit of a mix. If not just clean as just one simple -- one simple line item.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. Thanks.","Josh Jepsen","All right. Thanks Ross.","Josh Jepsen","All right. Well, thanks everyone we appreciate your participation. I hope everyone has happy Thanksgiving and we'll be available today for callbacks. Take care.","Operator","Thank you and this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. At this time you may disconnect your lines."],"6921":["Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) F1Q 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call  February 12, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Tony Huegel - Director of Investor Relations","Susan Karlix - Manager of Investor Communications","Raj Kalathur - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","Andy Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Adam Fleck - Morningstar","Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to Deere and Company\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call.

Also on the call today are Raj Kalathur, our chief financial officer; and Susan Karlix, our manager of investor communications.","Today we\u2019ll take a closer look at Deere\u2019s first quarter earnings, then spend some time talking about our markets and our outlook for fiscal 2014. After that, we will respond to your questions. Please note that slides are available to complement the call this morning.

With this morning\u2019s first quarter earnings announcement, John Deere has started 2014 on an impressive [unintelligible]. Income and sales both reached new records for the first quarter of the year. It was our 15th consecutive quarter of record earnings. The improvement was broad-based, with all three of our divisions reporting higher income.","Performance for the quarter also reflected success executing our marketing and operating plans, which are aimed at expanding our customer base worldwide. A deft execution is essential to successfully launching new products and getting new capacity up and running. ","Finally, our full year earnings forecast remains unchanged, at approximately $3.3 billion. It was, in short, a sound start to what is expected to be another good year.","Now let\u2019s take a look at the first quarter in detail, beginning on slide three. Net sales and revenues were up 3% to $7.7 billion. Net income attributable to Deer & Company was $681 million, which, as noted, was the highest income ever recorded in any first quarter. EPS was up 10% to $1.81. ","On slide four, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 2% to $6.9 billion. This includes an unfavorable impact from currency translations of 2 points. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let\u2019s start with agriculture and turf, on slide five. Sales were up 2%, due to a number of factors, including John Deere Landscape, a smooth final tier four transition, and slightly higher than anticipated shipments of several other products. Operating profit was up 4% to $797 million. In spite of the transition of small combines, 7R tractors, and sprayers to final tier four, ag and turf\u2019s incremental margin was an impressive 30%. ","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let\u2019s look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide six outlines U.S. farm cash receipts, which are forecast to be down somewhat from 2013. Assuming trend yields, grain production levels are expected to be up in 2014, which would result in lower feed grain prices. Livestock receipts are forecast to remain at record levels. As a result, our forecasts call for 2014 cash receipts to be about $378 billion, down 7% from 2013, which was the highest level ever recorded. ","On slide seven, global corn stocks used remain at historically low levels. Corn production was strong in 2013, due to good weather globally, resulting in higher yields. However, global corn stocks used are only expected to increase about 1 percentage point. In addition, global corn plantings will likely decrease in 2014. In fact, our Deere estimate expects approximately 4 million acres of corn to shift to soybeans in the next planting season in the U.S. ","Taking a global look, our consultant, Informa, is forecasting a cut in planted corn area of about 10% in Brazil for the 2013-2014 season. Planted corn acres for Argentina\u2019s early crop were down about 30%. Informa expects another 4% to 5% drop in the late corn crop.","Moving to the CIS, Ukraine is also expected to cut back on corn planted area by about 20%. If 2014 brings unfavorable growing conditions in any part of the world, the U.S., Brazil, and Argentina in particular, corn stocks used would fall, and commodity prices could rebound.","Our economic outlook for the E.U. 28 is on slide eight. These prices are close to historic highs, and record milk prices are supporting livestock and dairy farmers. Grain prices and farm income are expected to be lower in 2014, but remain near long term averages. While it appears that short term economic stress has diminished for now, concerns over slow European Union growth are weighing on farmer confidence. ","A differentiated picture continues to exit by country. While we see demand improving in the U.K. and Spain, some decline in important markets like France and Germany bears watching. As a result, farm machinery demand is expected to be lower in 2014.","On slide nine, you\u2019ll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In the CIS, credit availability continues to weigh on equipment sales and import policies are negatively impacting combine sales in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. Late fall planning in Russia has put some of the 2014 winter crops at risk. ","Slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness in Brazil. For 2014, value of ag production in Brazil is expected to increase about 3% over the 2013 level. Brazil\u2019s soybean production is expected to increase again in 2013-2014, on the heels of historically high prices and margins. On the other hand, while partially offset by the weak real, lower global commodity prices could reduce farm income. ","As shown on slide 11, in mid-December, the Brazilian government announced the [FINAME] interest rates for 2014. The interest rates now in place are 4.5% for small and medium farmers and 6% for large farmers, both up from 3.5%.","The new FINAME rates remain at very attractive levels. Concerning inflation in Brazil, it was slightly over 6% in 2013, and private financing rates are currently in the mid-teens. Consequently, Deere does not expect any significant impact on sales from the higher rates.","This morning, we introduced a new line of planters and planter technology, highlighted on slide 12, at the Louisville Farm Show. Planting is a critically important operation to a farmer, and breakthrough technology in this planter takes inbound feed spacing, accuracy, and depth control to a new level, even at higher speeds.","At 10 miles per hour, twice the speed of current machines, our ExactEmerge planter achieves equivalent or better in-ground spacing and depth control. This new planter allows producers to cover more acres in less time. This is critically important when they are challenged by narrow planting windows to reach maximum yield potential.","Our 2014 ag and turf industry outlooks, all unchanged since last quarter, are summarized on slide 13. In the U.S. and Canada, we expect an industry decline of 5% to 10%, mainly reflecting lower sales of higher horsepower tractors and combines. The E.U. 28 industry outlook is down about 5% due to lower crop prices and farm income. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be down 5% to 10% from 2013\u2019s strong levels.","[Latin America] continues to grow in importance for Deere. Our tractor market share has grown considerably there, and our strong position in other products such as combines, sugar cane harvesters, sprayers, and feeding equipment should not go unnoticed. ","Shifting to the CIS, we expect industry sales to be down slightly, while in Asia, sales are projected to be up slightly. Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be up about 5% in 2014.","Putting this all together on slide 14, fiscal year 2014 Deere sales of worldwide ag and turf equipment are forecast to be down about 6%. In the year over year comparison of net sales, landscape accounts for about half of the change. ","2014 operating margin for the ag and turf division is forecast at about 14%. The 2 point decline from 2013 is a result of mix, foreign exchange, and higher overhead costs, including implementation costs related to final tier four. We have talked for some time about how a favorable mix associated with strength in the large ag sector has been benefitting margins by 1 to 2 points. This year, the mix benefit is forecast to be about 1 point.","Let\u2019s focus now on construction and forestry, on slide 15. Net sales were up 4% in the quarter, and operating profit was up 32%. The division\u2019s incremental margin of about 45% is a result of C&F\u2019s diligent focus on cost. An aerial view of our two new construction factories in Brazil is on slide 16. ","We feel Brazil has the long term demographic and market characteristics that the John Deere strategy is built around. The construction equipment market in Brazil is expanding at a rapid pace, and the country continues to grow as an exporter of agricultural and other commodities. This means that we\u2019ll continue to expand and upgrade its transportation system and infrastructure. At the same time, urbanization and increasing incomes are creating demand for more housing and institutional building. ","The Deere Brazil factory is solely owned and will manufacture backhoe loaders and four wheel drive loaders. The factory has manufacturing capabilities similar to our U.S. facilities, which include cutting steel, welding, machining, painting, and product assembly. ","The Deere Hitachi Brazil factory is a 50-50 joint venture with Hitachi Construction Machinery Company Limited. It will produce five John Deere and Hitachi branded excavator models. Backhoe and excavator production have started. We will begin loader production later this year.","Moving to slide 17, looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, the economy continues slowly moving forward, and there are positive signs in the market. Construction employment numbers are rising, housing starts are ramping up, home sales and prices are improving, and home inventories are low. Some markets are seeing building lot shortages. Landscaping activity is picking up, and financing for land developers is slowly recovering. ","Additionally, we continue to see a strong domestic energy sector. Deere\u2019s construction and forestry sales are forecast to be up about 10% for the year, which is unchanged from a quarter ago. The increase reflects higher shipments following the low levels of 2013, industry growth in response to an improving U.S. economy, and increased international sales.","Global forestry markets are expected to be up about 5% in 2014. Following double-digit growth in 2013, North American forestry markets are expected up about 5%, while Europe and Russia are expected to improve from the depressed levels of 2013. C&F\u2019s full year operating margin is projected to be about 9%. ","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operations. Slide 18 shows the financial services provision for credit losses at 3 basis points, based on the percentage of the total average owned portfolio at the end of the year. ","This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. Our 2014 financial forecast contemplates a loss provision of about 13 basis points. Losses remain well below the 10-year average of about 28 basis points, and the 15-year average, of about 48 basis points.","Moving to slide 19, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $142 million in the first quarter versus $133 million last year. 2014 net income attributable to Deere & Company is forecast to be about $600 million, which is unchanged from a quarter ago.","Slide 20 outlines receivables and inventory. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $898 million. That was equal to 26.4% of prior 12-month sales, down from 29.8% a year ago.","Ag and turf ending receivables and inventory were down $633 million. About half of the decrease is accounted for by John Deere Landscapes, with the remainder due to lower inventory associated with planned reduce volumes in the second quarter and foreign exchange.","Construction and forestry ended the quarter down $265 million, driven by a decrease in Canadian consigned inventories. We expect to end 2014 with receivables and inventory down about $75 million. ","Our 2014 guidance for cost of sales as a percentage of net sales, shown on slide 21, is about 75%. When modeling 2014, keep in mind the following: price, about 2 points; lower pension and OPEB expense; an unfavorable mix of product in ag, as we talked about earlier; tier four [credit] costs; overhead spend due to tier four transitions; and foreign exchange.","Looking at R&D expense, on slide 22, R&D was down about 9% in the first quarter, mainly due to timing of projects. Our 2014 forecast calls for R&D expense to be about flat with last year. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 4% in the first quarter, and is forecast to be down about 5% for the year. In the year over year comparison of SA&G expenses, Landscapes accounts for about 7 points of the change. ","On slide 24, pension and OPEB expense was down about $40 million in the quarter, and is forecast to be down about $150 million for the full year. Turning to slide 25, the equipment operations tax rate was approximately 31% in the first quarter. For full year 2014, the effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.","On slide 26, you see our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Our forecast for cash flow from equipment operations remains at approximately $3.9 billion in 2014. On slide 27, we outline our 2014 outlook for the second quarter and full year. ","Our net sales forecast for the second quarter is down about 6% compared with 2013. This includes about 2 points of price realization. In the year over year comparison of second quarter sales, Landscapes accounts for about 3 points of the change. ","A couple of things to keep in mind when modeling second quarter sales and incremental margins. As has been the case the last few years, changeover of engine technologies creates anomalies in our normal seasonality patterns. Production levels will be down in the second quarter, due to final tier four transition. Products transitioning in the quarter will be important ones, such as large combines and 8R tractors, so mix will also be a factor. ","The full year forecast calls for net sales to be down about 3%. In the year over year comparison of net sales, Landscapes accounts for about 3 points of the change. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 2 points. FX is expected to be negative by about 1 point. Finally, our 2014 full year net income forecast remains at about $3.3 billion. ","In closing, John Deere has entered 2014 at a strong pace. Even in the face of lower demand for large farm machinery, we believe the company is well-positioned to deliver solid performance and have another good year.","Indeed, we believe our extensive investments in new products, new markets, and additional capacity will provide strong support to our results and keep our strategic plans moving ahead. As a result, we remain highly confident about the company\u2019s future prospects and our ability to deliver value to our customers and investors in the quarters and the years to come.","Tony Huegel","","Thank you, Susan. We\u2019re now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure, but as a reminder, in consideration of others, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow up. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Operator? ","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] The first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Barclays Capital. ","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays ","Can you talk about the near term visibility that you have in ag? You guided to overall equipment sales down 6%. We assume some modest growth in C&F in the quarter, so you\u2019re seeing this falloff in ag and turf. Susan mentioned the IT4 transition. Is that sort of what this is, more of, in Q2? And then can you talk about the order book in that context? You had pretty good visibility around wheeled tractors especially. Has anything really changed in the order book?","Tony Huegel","You\u2019re right, the second quarter, such as you look at ag and turf, is very much about the final tier four transition. Keep in mind, as she pointed, that you have the 8R tractors transitioning during the month of April, and we also have large combines transitioning during the quarter as well. So we talk about combine shipping patterns for example, have in the past, and this year we would say, first half, second half is about 45% first half, 55% second half. Last year it was about 50-50. So not a significant change, but if you look quarter to quarter, there is a big change in the second quarter, where our expected shipments will be down, similarly on tractors.","If you look at order book, we continue to have a very strong order book on tractors. In fact, if you look at 8R tractors, the wheeled models, our order book is now into early September in terms of kind of how we would look at first availability. Now, keep in mind, that is on a lower production schedule, or said differently, a lower allocation for U.S. and Canada tractors, in that. And it of course accounts also for the fact that we have some lower production in the second quarter in particular.","As you know, on combines, we don\u2019t talk so much about effective availability as much as how the early order programs came in. And they were down year over year on the combine early order program. It would have been down a double digit. Roughly in line with our expectations. So as we look at our outlook for 2014, especially as it relates to large ag equipment, year over year our order books are, I\u2019d say, if you just kind of took a broad brush on large product, are roughly in line, in terms of the coverage we have, keeping in mind on lower expectations, but certainly have relatively the same level of coverage of orders versus our forecast.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays ","And then you previously said that your base case in ag and turf was based on an extension of Section 179, sort of a middle ground around 250,000. Has your thinking changed on that? And how do we get comfortable that there wasn\u2019t some significant pull forward in equipment purchases in your November-December timeframe? Maybe you could give us some color on how January was versus those two months.","Tony Huegel ","We would say today, our base case in terms of what we have modeled, we still continue to expect that we\u2019ll have an extension of both the bonus depreciation and the Section 179, at kind of that half level for Section 179. Now, keep in mind, the difference, though, that we would say today is, really expecting that to happen later in the year. ","Of course, if there is any extension, we would anticipate that it would be made retroactive, but that still means our business until then, in our customers\u2019 buying decisions, there is an element of uncertainty in terms of whether or not they\u2019ll actually have those tax incentives by the end of the year. But that would be our base case, that they would come in.","In terms of pull ahead, again, I think if you look at our first quarter, some of the strength there really was, when we talked about it ahead of time, in November and December, production of combines was higher than normal, as we were preparing for the final tier four transition, so we still had a couple of months of interim tier four purchases. Certainly from a used equipment perspective, we think that was beneficial, as those U.S. tax incentives were expiring and customers knew that. ","But the reality is, from a retail sales perspective, if customers are coming in late in the year trying to take advantage of those tax incentives on new equipment, they would have had very limited opportunity in terms of just the availability of the equipment we would have to sell to them at that point in time. So it\u2019s a pretty limited pull ahead as it relates to tax incentives.","Operator","Your next question is from Steven Volkmann with Jefferies.","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies ","Can I just ask you, you know, your first quarter obviously came in a little bit better than what you had expected. And again, I guess I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of the cadence. Was this sort of more preparation for the switchover to tier four final? Or was there something else that drove that?","Tony Huegel ","Certainly on the top line we would have had a little more strength, obviously, than what we would have guided to. And really, there isn\u2019t a simple answer in terms of one particular item or even a couple of items. Susan kind of hit a few of the larger items, and there were a variety. We talked about the fact that, with the John Deere Landscapes we did end up with more sales in the quarter than what we had anticipated in the forecast. And as you might expect, with those sorts of situations, you put in your best estimate and things do move around a little bit.","And then to your point, we did have some timing benefit in terms of shipments. Some of that was related to our tier four transition in the quarter. It went better than we had even anticipated, and so we were able to ship more product than what we had in the forecast. And there were a variety of other products, it wasn\u2019t a transition, but we were able to ship some additional products in the quarter.","I wouldn\u2019t imply that - and obviously it didn\u2019t change dramatically our full year production, so I wouldn\u2019t say that was necessarily a strength that we would expect to have those higher level of sales as we move forward.","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies ","And then just a quick follow up. I think if I\u2019m not mistaken you took your ag and forestry margin expectation down to 14% from the 15% we had last quarter. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong. But I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s any color you want to give us around that. I noticed that you didn\u2019t really go up. So what made up the difference to keep the guidance kind of flat?","Tony Huegel ","I assume you meant the ag and turf?","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies ","I\u2019m sorry, yes.","Tony Huegel ","So yeah, I mean, really a big change there is around FX, is probably the biggest change that\u2019s impacting the margins there. The remaining difference year over year is very similar to what we would have talked about in the original budget. Obviously, from a positive perspective, we are expecting price realization. Talked a little bit about pension OPEB having some benefit there. But then from a negative side, mix is a big item, and then the tier four transition, both from a product cost perspective, as well as the overhead expenses related to those transitions are really the biggest drags on that operating profit. ","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies ","But Tony, is mix worse than it was a quarter ago?","Tony Huegel ","No, if you\u2019re looking at the change from original budget, it\u2019s really more about FX. That would be the biggest change.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America ","Could you talk a little bit more about your South American farm equipment outlook and how you\u2019re planning to manage production in the region? You\u2019re down 5%-10% retail sales outlook, but you\u2019re also forecasting soybean prices down another 17% into the \u201914-15 crop year, which obviously implies that we\u2019re on a downward pricing slope as fiscal \u201914 unfolds. How do you avoid overproducing to the region in this environment, and what are you hearing from your Latin American dealers right now?","Tony Huegel ","Keep in mind, as we think about our South American outlook, that\u2019s anticipating just tractors and combines. And as we talk quite often, we have a significant business outside of tractors and combines. More than a third of our sales there would be product beyond the tractors and combines in that region. So those are continuing to have some strong sales as well. ","So as we look at that South American market, Brazil in particular, we\u2019re still looking for some very positive things to come from that region. We\u2019ve talked a lot about our market share improvement, especially in tractors. We saw some nice market share movement on combines as well in 2013. So our business there is actually continuing to be pretty strong. ","Keep in mind, too, as you look at commodity prices, and as you project out into 2014, a couple of things. Generally, we\u2019re assuming in those numbers trend yields at this point, and so that would assume that we would have some very good weather and some good production. And we\u2019re seeing corn acres come down, and much of that is moving into soybean acres. So if you see that shift into soybeans and good growing conditions, which is a big assumption, then you\u2019re going to see some drawdown in soybean prices as a result of that","But keep in mind too, as it relates specifically to Brazil, with the FX impact today, and the weaker real, it doesn\u2019t have quite as strong of an impact on farmer incomes as it might in other parts of the world, in the U.S. in particular. So that\u2019s actually helping buoy those farmer incomes in Brazil.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America ","And then just on my follow up, for construction equipment, clearly you\u2019re looking for further acceleration as the year progresses to hit your plus-10% outlook. Does your order book reflect that optimism at this point? Have you seen any drop-off in demand in early \u201914 on the back of, perhaps, a pre-buy in front of final tier four?","Tony Huegel ","No, in fact we would tell you, as we look at our order book, just kind of broadly speaking, we would tell you they\u2019re very strong and so we continue to be encouraged by that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets ","In Brazil, did you experience a pause around the dislocation in the FINAME financing? And has that reaccelerated since the program\u2019s been cleared up? ","Tony Huegel ","Sure, and I think that would be a fair way to say it. You know, as it ramps down, the 2013 program, at the 3.5%, and then the new rates have been announced for 2014. But it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time for those to kind of ramp back up. Our view, though, overall, is that\u2019s a short term sort of pause and we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to have an impact on our overall shipment for the year. And you\u2019ll likely see that in the numbers coming out on [Fabia] here in the next month or so, where you\u2019ll see a little bit weaker shipment volumes across the industry. But again, we think that\u2019s a short term issue","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets ","And then the pricing realization for the first quarter came in at plus 2 versus I think the plus 3 that was expected. Is there any color around that, and can you talk separately about the acceptance of the tier four pricing that you\u2019re pushing through?","Tony Huegel ","I would tell you, keep in mind, those are rounded numbers, the 2 into 3. So it doesn\u2019t take a lot of shift in the actual number for that to move from 2 to 3. So I wouldn\u2019t read a lot into that difference on the price realization. Regarding the pricing on final tier four, obviously we didn\u2019t change our annual projection on price realization, and I think the easiest way to answer that is looking at the 8R tractors, where that\u2019s, I think, about an 8% increase in price this year. We\u2019ll have to look at that again. But you know, again, we\u2019re seeing very strong orders continue on that, and that production beyond May, obviously, is all final tier four.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research ","Quick question on used equipment. Can you give us some idea what the status of used equipment around the dealers are? That was a complaint that we kept hearing, that used equipment is pretty [high] now, with Section 179 not being applicable, at least for now, for used equipment. Is there any issue there, with product or [unintelligible] that we have to worry about?","Tony Huegel ","I would start with saying that we look at used equipment broadly speaking. We think used equipment is in relatively good shape. Keep in mind, if you look at absolute levels, certainly, it\u2019s at high levels. But that\u2019s reflective of the very high level of sales we\u2019ve had. ","Now, if you dive a little deeper, used combine inventories are actually in very good shape. Our dealers did some great work in bringing those down, really during the fiscal fourth quarter of last year, and those continued to be at good levels from our perspective. Large tractors are certainly at higher levels, but again, it\u2019s relative to the sales and is not raising any red flags. ","As you know, we\u2019re always cautious about used equipment, and always focused on used equipment. So I can\u2019t say that we don\u2019t have any concerns about it, because we always do, but I wouldn\u2019t say necessarily any significantly heightened concerns around used equipment. ","And depending on what dealers you\u2019re speaking with, keep in mind, my comments are really talking about, on a broad basis, certainly there\u2019s going to be pockets on all products, where you\u2019re going to see a little bit elevated inventory at certain dealers, those sorts of things. So that\u2019s always the case.","Raj Kalathur ","And if I can add, on the pricing, for low crop and four wheel drive tractors, used pricing has actually been up. Now, for some models of combine, it has come down high single-digits. So the pricing overall held their [tier]. So since it came down low single digits, the combine pricing has stayed. So we feel very good about the pricing as well, although, like Tony said, we\u2019re always going to be cautious about used equipment.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research ","And a quick follow up. Can you talk about you\u2019re thinking in production schedules in the second half of the year? You were up a couple of percent in the first quarter in ag, down in the second quarter. Are we looking at just modest declines right now in the plans for the third and fourth quarter? Or is there any [skew] in one quarter, but weaker in the other. Usually, sometimes the fourth quarter takes the hit, and is the one that can change if necessary?","Tony Huegel ","I don\u2019t know that I would expect anything real dramatic, other than the second quarter. But if you\u2019re looking at the back half of the year, obviously, for the full year we\u2019re expecting some lower production levels, but in terms of skewing between quarters versus normal production, I think the biggest difference is going to be around second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan ","Can you talk about, if the Section 179 or accelerated depreciation did not get extended, would it be fair to say that fiscal \u201915 will be looking tougher than fiscal \u201914, in an environment with no tax incentives?","Tony Huegel ","Certainly, if all else is equal, and you remove U.S. tax incentives, certainly that would tend to have a negative impact. But keep in mind, as you know and are well aware, there\u2019s a number of factors that farmers look at when they\u2019re making their buying decisions. And obviously tax is just one of those.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan ","Sure, and cash receipts being the other, and also forecasted to be down.","Tony Huegel ","Certainly cash receipts, as you point out, is forecasted to be down somewhat. Keep in mind, some of that, as you look year over year, 2013 was raised considerably by the USDA as well. Some of that increase, though is, as you see, drought in California and other parts of the country. For example, you\u2019re seeing some higher levels of receipts from fruits and vegetables, livestock is certainly better as well. So that\u2019s starting to give a little bit different view and maybe a little bit more skewed view of \u201914 versus \u201913.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan ","And my follow up question is more academic, really. With the farm bill passed and the base level prices of $370 for corn and $840 for beans and [insurance], why wouldn\u2019t we expect to see more acres of corn than you are projecting? And have you taken into consideration the $370 and the $840 when putting together your forecast for acres for corn?","Tony Huegel ","As you know, that was just signed into law last Friday, and so we\u2019re still evaluating what all that means, and what the implications are throughout the business. So what we\u2019d tell you is certainly the farm bill is supportive. It\u2019s a long term farm bill, very supportive, from our perspective, for our farmer customers.","In terms of short term impact on our business, I think I would say the biggest impact just removes one level of uncertainty that had been there previously. So that, certainly on the margin, would be positive, but I think it\u2019s a little premature to talk about what other, either positive or negative, benefits - although we would certainly see more positive than negative, from the farm bill - but what the details may preclude.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan ","But wouldn\u2019t you agree that the difference between current prices and $370 versus current prices of beans and $840 would\u2026","Tony Huegel ","Certainly, current prices of corn would be above that $370 level. So I\u2019m not sure that would have a dramatic impact, but again, for us, it\u2019s a little premature for us to comment on that. But it\u2019s certainly something we\u2019d be looking at.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse ","I noticed on your construction and forestry side, you took down your non-res assumption a little bit. Can you just tell us what\u2019s implied in your construction forecast, above 10%, with regard to non-res, if you\u2019re leaving some room for upside there, or is it mostly just res at this point?","Tony Huegel ","I would say for starters, it\u2019s a relatively small factor in our modeling, and in terms of what we\u2019re looking at. Maybe taking it a little bit broader, as we look at our up 10% for construction and forestry sales, for the year, just roughly, you could say it\u2019s about a third a third a third in terms of where that growth is coming from. ","About a third of it is coming from industry growth, our expected industry growth in the underlying business. Roughly a third is higher shipments around some inventory adjustments. As you may remember, we ended 2013 with new inventory levels at our dealers, very, very low, and so we would expect some rebuild of that inventory. ","And then about a third will come from markets outside the U.S. and Canada. We highlighted our new Brazilian facilities, forestry, and Europe and Russia are expected to recover off of some pretty low levels that see some recovery there as well. So that\u2019s really where that 10% is coming from. So it\u2019s a variety of factors, one of which is certainly a stronger U.S. and Canada industry.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse ","And then no one\u2019s mentioned buyback at this point. Can you just talk about any updated thoughts on the remainder of the year?","Raj Kalathur ","Our use of cash priorities stay the same. We\u2019ll be real convicted on it. First, keeping enough liquidity for maintaining our A rating, second, for all our capital expenditures and M&A requirements, and third, modestly but consistently increasing our dividends and keeping it between 35% and 25% from [mid-cycle] earnings. And only after doing those would we use our cash for share repurchases.","Now, the $8 billion share repurchase is essentially a statement we are making that we\u2019ll have enough confidence in our ability to generate good cash the next few years to be able to return cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, but only when and if it adds good value to our long term shareholders.","There are a couple of differences you need to note from last year\u2019s first quarter to this year\u2019s first quarter. Last year first quarter we had a little bit more caution in terms of the uncertainty in the external markets, and the financial and capital markets. We felt slightly better about that this time, and we\u2019ve also said the $300 million plus that we get out of the John Deere Landscape\u2019s partial sale, we\u2019ll give it back in the form of share repurchase, and you\u2019ve seen some of that come out in the first quarter of \u201914 as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Wertheimer with Vertical Research Partners.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners ","The gross margin change year over year on solid ag revenue, can you quantify maybe the currency impact and\/or whatever on the impact you want to quantify and why it went down?","Tony Huegel ","Again, it\u2019s really related to FX. And again, I\u2019d remind you, these are rounded numbers, and so keep that in mind as well. But again, the biggest impact really is the FX.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners ","And then if I understand what you mentioned on the production schedule and the outlook, I\u2019m not sure how far forward you\u2019d normally be booked on tractors at this point. I\u2019m guessing that you took your production down consistent with your guide, let\u2019s say 10% or 20% on the [high horsepower] and therefore you\u2019re booked solidly out, but booked out down at that level. Is that right? Are you constraining demand by pushing that out further, just because of the uncertainty in the market? Can you maybe give a little detail around that?","Tony Huegel ","I think how we would describe it, obviously, as we look at our availability, that is on assumed lower production levels, at least that\u2019s what we\u2019re allocating to the U.S. and Canada, consistent with our lower projections for the year. So as you look at year over year, though, the 8R tractor I mentioned, early September, last year you were in early July in terms of effective availability. And then on nines, and these are wheeled tractors, you\u2019d be early May this year and you were kind of mid to late April last year. The track tractors on both of those would actually be closer in that last year, but remember we had some availability constraints earlier in the year last year on tracks. So we were kind of mid to late June this year versus late August last year on eights, and nines were early April versus August of last year. But the wheeled tractor are the larger part of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. ","Andy Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Just wanted to get a better feel for the combine and series 8R production profile through the year. Should we expect it to go back to run rate in Q3, after the air pocket in Q2? Or should we anticipate kind of the slow ramp up from that Q2 level?","Tony Huegel","Certainly on the combines, as you look year over year, and how I\u2019m looking at it is percent of the annual shipment, so keep in mind we\u2019re on a lower year over year production schedule on those combines, you would see a little bit heavier actually year over year in both the third and fourth quarter, but not a dramatic shift. And it\u2019s fairly evenly spread between the two quarters. So again, on combine, you saw higher first quarter, lower second quarter. Third and fourth, to your point, gets more in line with the run rates that we would have had last year. ","And I don\u2019t have that level of detail on the 8R tractors, other than I know second quarter is certainly the quarter that\u2019s impacted on those 8R tractors. And then I would assume you\u2019re going to go back to more normal run rates, again on lower production levels, but more normal run rates into the third and fourth quarters. ","Andy Casey - Wells Fargo Securities ","And if we could kind of look at one of your competitors, who made some comments about a 20% drop in their orders for Europe, could you give a little color on what you\u2019re seeing over in that region?","Tony Huegel ","You know, as Susan, I think, pointed out a little bit, it does vary country by country in terms of what you\u2019re seeing overall. Our outlook is down 5%. So I don\u2019t know if they were perhaps speaking about a specific country or not, but that would be a pretty dramatic drop. But generally speaking, the U.K. is a little stronger year over year. Of course, they were coming off of a weather-related lower level in 2013. Staying on the margin would be a little lower.","You know, we\u2019re seeing some flat to maybe a little bit of weakness in some of the markets like Germany and France, but again, they\u2019re coming off of some strong markets as well. We certainly aren\u2019t hearing any kind of dramatic reduction like that in terms of orders in that particular region. So again, we\u2019re kind of seeing a market that\u2019s a little softer year over year, but generally hanging in there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Fleck with Morningstar.","Adam Fleck - Morningstar ","I wanted to follow up on the C&F segment. You know that the dealer inventories were awfully low at the end of last year, but your volumes were down this quarter. I\u2019m just curious, did dealers continue to reduce their inventories, or was it basically flat? Any details would be helpful.","Tony Huegel ","The biggest difference really in the quarter, year over year, relates to our investors in Canada. And you may be aware, we have consigned inventories there. So we did draw down those inventories in the quarter. And so if you look at shipments versus retail, they were pretty much in line this quarter, and we would anticipate that that would shift toward heavier shipments over retail as we move through the year.","Adam Fleck - Morningstar ","And then Russia and Kazakhstan and all are still dealing with these combine tariff headwinds. Just curious if you had any thoughts or updates on how that may play out for you?","Tony Huegel ","At this point, the easy answer is that\u2019s a shifting environment and continues to be the one that\u2019s challenging from that perspective. Certainly they did make a little bit of a change in terms of some allocations of combines that they would allow in, and then there\u2019s also some requirement changes in terms of beyond the allocation, moving more away from tariffs and toward required local content to import beyond what the allocations allow. ","For 2014, we feel pretty confident that we\u2019ve met those local content requirements, but the challenge is, in future years, what will the definitions be, and how quickly can we ramp up and meet those requirements. So we would still be very cautious about that region on the basis of not necessarily import tariffs, but import policies in that region, and the challenge of meeting those as they shift.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joel Tiss of BMO.","Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets ","I\u2019ll just ask both my questions together. The first one is the regional breakdown, can you just give us a little more color region by region in Europe? And then second, is there anything notable happening in the finance business, why the margins dropped, and just what the outlook for those margins in the second and third quarter?","Tony Huegel ","Are you referring to the comment around spread, on financial service?","Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets ","Yeah, some of your regions, and that might hurt the mix going forward.","Tony Huegel ","Some of that, as you look at the portfolio, the mix of the portfolio does impact our spread in the sense that as you get a higher ag portfolio, and the returns on that portfolio would not be as high from a spread perspective as some of the others. And so that\u2019s part of the answer there. Certainly, from Europe, other than that, I talked a little bit about France and Germany, U.K. and Spain. You know, those are probably the highlights. ","Maybe to give a little more color, as you think about [cap] reform, in 2014, certain regions you may see a short term impact there as they transition to the new plan. The cap changes do put, in some cases, more flexibility country by country, and so some of the eastern European countries, we would anticipate there may be a short term slowdown in the sense of how they get the definitions out and apply those cap payments. But again, that\u2019s a real short term kind of phenomenon. But outside of that, I really don\u2019t have much more I can add. ","Operator, if we can go to the next caller? And this will be our last call.","Operator","The final question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. ","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","The first question I had is congrats on the early tier four success. I\u2019m wondering if you could help us dial in a little bit more, though, how you\u2019re thinking about the decremental margins for the second quarter, and maybe how much contingency you have in the plan?","Tony Huegel ","You know, as you look at second quarter, when you think about decremental margins, remember that you\u2019re talking about key products with 8R tractors and large combine, as well as the lower production of those products, and you also have higher costs from an overhead perspective as we\u2019re transitioning those products and bringing those lines down and so on. So those two, coupled together, can have some sizable impact on operating margins in that second quarter as we look forward. ","And in terms of what\u2019s in our forecast, that is our best estimate based on our current production plans. Those can shift either direction. One week can make a big impact if there\u2019s a delay or we\u2019re a little bit ahead, as you saw in part in the first quarter. So I would tell you that there\u2019s as much risk that you could see that production schedule slide a little bit as be pulled forward some. So that\u2019s how we tend to put the forecast together, and what we would expect for second quarter.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research ","And just a clarification, you had mentioned that you\u2019re watching the used tractor market a bit. Have you made any changes to programs yet?","Tony Huegel ","You know, we\u2019re always working with our dealer network in terms of how best to work through used equipment and so on, so there\u2019s always peaks. We\u2019re still using pool funds as the basis of our effort with dealers. From time to time, we\u2019ll change what programs they can utilize that pool fund for, and in some cases tweak some existing one, maybe add some additional here and there. So those sorts of things happen on a regular basis. But nothing dramatically different in terms of shifting away from pool funds or anything of that nature.","And with that, we\u2019ll conclude our call. But as always, we\u2019ll be available throughout the rest of the day for call backs. Thank you.

With this morning's first quarter earnings announcement John Deere has started 2013 on a strong note. Income and sales both reached new records for the first quarter of the year and this was our 11th consecutive quarter of record earnings. Our results benefited from healthy farm conditions and the strong sales of agricultural equipment.","Deere's performance also reflected success executing our ambitious marketing and operating plans. Such execution is especially important right now as we are adding new products and global capacity at unprecedented rates. Finally, our full-year earnings forecast has been adjusted upward and now stands at about really $3.3 billion. Also, it was a solid start to what is expected to be another good year.","Now let's take a look at the first quarter in detail beginning on slide three. Net sales and revenues were up 10% to $7.4 billion in the quarter. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $650 million and earnings per share increased 27% to $1.65.","On slide four, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were $6.8 billion, up 11% quarter-over-quarter including an unfavorable impact from currency translation of about one point. Price realization in the quarter was positive by three points.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on slide 5. Sales were up 16% in the quarter on continuing strength in the large Ag sector, especially tractors and combines. Recall, combine production and shipments were back end loaded in 2012 to facilitate our transition to interim Tier 4. Operating profit was $766 million.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the Ag business. Slide six outlines U.S. commodity price estimates that underlie our financial forecast. 2012-2013 corn, soybean and wheat prices reflect the production shortfall caused by the weather-driven events that affected the 2011 and 2012 season and continue to support equipment sales.","At this time of the year it is hard to determine what the 2013 2014 crop year will bring. Clearly, the upcoming growing season has a lot of questions around it. Among other things, it should be noted that existing moisture condition show that U.S. drought continues to be of significance. Research, however shows that the moisture situation going into the growing season has virtually no impact on the final outcome. The primary point is that temperature and moisture level experienced during the key growing season are the most important factors in determining yield. As is our custom at this time of the year, our estimates for 2013, 2014 crop year, will see normal weather and trend yields.","Slide seven shows planted acres and yields for the 2012-2013 crop year, compared to the corresponding forecast for 2013-2014 crop year. Again, assuming trend yields in normal weather conditions, corn yields are forecast to increase about 31%, while soybean yields are forecast to be up about 12%.","Slide eight highlights cash receipts. Driven by strong crop prices, 2012 forecast cash receipts are at a record $389 million. In 2013, strong crop prices, higher yields and increase livestock receipts for 2013 cash receipts even higher. As a reminder, in our modeling, current and prior year cash receipts are the primary driver of equipment purchases in the U.S. market. With cash receipts at record levels, this serves well for future farm prospects.","Slide nine illustrates the U.S. farm gross cash income, which is cash receipts plus other farm related income. This slide highlights a relatively small percentage, the government payments and crop insurance play, in gross cash income as represented by green and black areas. Government payments in green are included in total cash receipts numbers on slide eight. For the three years shown, government payments are only about 3% of the total.","Crop insurance receipts are included in other farm related income, the black area and our historic levels in 2011 and 2012 due to drought related events. Total crop insurance payments for 2012 are expected to be in the $15 billion to 16 billion range. As of last week, crop insurance industry payouts totaled roughly $13.5 billion. At the high range, this equates to about 4% of 2012 forecast gross cash income. For your reference, 2011 crop insurance payouts were approximately $10.8 billion.","Our economic outlook for the EU27 is on slide 10. We are seeing offsetting trends in the EU. On one hand, strong crop prices are driving higher farm income. Conversely, in the U.K., the poor harvest of 2012 and wet weather conditions during the 2013 crop selling season are impacting equipment demand, as well the overall economic situation continues to weigh on farmer's sentiment.","Financial conditions in Northern Europe continue to be more favorable than in Southern Europe, but Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain, all experiencing severe recession.","On slide 11, you will see the economic fundamentals outlined for a few of our other targeted growth markets.","So let's focus on the CIS where our outlook has changed considerably from one quarter ago. Going into effect today and running through July 5, an additional 27.5% import duty has been placed on all imported combines going to Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus, bringing the import duty to 32.5%. This will have a considerable negative impact on sales of imported combines in these countries.","Slide 12 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness in Brazil. It encompasses over 20 different crops and has a high correlation to tractor sales over time. With forecast for a record soybean season due to an increase in acres planted, higher yields and sustained high crop prices, the 2013 value of Ag production in Brazil is expected to increase about 9% over the 2012 level.","Our 2013 and Ag and Turf industry outlooks are summarized on slide 13. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are now expected to be flat to up 5% in relation to the healthy levels of 2012. We continue to see strength in demand especially for high horsepower tractors and combines. However our outlook is tempered by drought related effects on the livestock sector. The EU27 industry outlook is now down about 5%. The number one driver in the decline to our outlook is last year's poor harvest and wet weather conditions that could affect the 2013 crop in the U.K. Also weighing on the outlook are overall economic conditions in Europe and the potential for further weakening.","Industry sales of tractors and combines in South America are now expected to be up 10% to 15% in 2013. With strong commodity prices, forecast call for an increase in planted acres resulting in significantly higher crop production. In addition, current government programs in Brazil support higher amounts of equipment sales, not only as the 2012, 2013 subsidy amount allocated to Agriculture higher by about 7.5% but interest rates are also extremely low. Benami financing is at 3% until June 30, then it goes to 3.5% through the end of December.","Our 2013 industry outlook in the CIS countries is now down slightly due to import duties that are expected to reduce demand, as previously discussed. In Asia we now expect industry demand to be slightly higher in 2013 versus 2012. In China, Ag subsidies are expected to be higher and very supportive of equipment sales. In addition, Chinese grain output is expected to increase and farm modernization initiatives are continuing to move ahead.","Although the India tractor market remains soft and industry sales aren\u2019t expected to improve from last year, it is encouraging that interest rates were recently lowered in order to support the economy.","Turning to another product category, we now expect industry retail sales of Turf and Utility equipment in the United States and Canada to be about flat in 2013, reflecting cautious consumer sentiment. Deere expects to outperform the industry with the launch of new turf and utility products especially new utility vehicles. Putting this all together on slide 14, fiscal year 2013 Deere sales of worldwide Ag and Turf equipment are now forecast to be up about 6%, two points higher than our November outlook. 2013 operating margin for the Ag and Turf division is forecast at about 15%.","Let's focus now on Construction and Forestry on slide 15. The division's results were affected by lower shipment volumes, higher production costs including those associated with interim Tier 4 and unfavorable mix of products. Quarter-over-quarter was a very tough compare for C&F. Normally, the first quarter has low production. In the first quarter last year, especially in November and December, the division had extremely high production volumes of high horsepower machines to facilitate the transition to interim Tier 4 engines. As a result, mix in the current quarter also shifted to more purchased products, like excavators and the smaller commercial worksite machines. Increased R&D and SA&G expenses in support of global growth also impacted the quarter's results.","On slide 16, looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, Global Insight, has slightly improved its outlook for housing starts and government spending growth. However, our outlook remains cautious as overall economic growth continues at a slow pace awaiting resolution of the fiscal, economic and trade issues that are undermining business confidence and restraining growth. Growth for forestry markets are expected to be about flat in 2013 as weakness in Europe is being offset by improvement in the United States.","Fiscal 2013 net sales in Construction & Forestry are now forecast to be up about 3%. Our previous outlook was up about 8%. The decline reflects lower dealer orders as we see emerging caution regarding inventory levels within our dealers group.","C&F full year operating margin is projected to be about 8%. While Construction & Forestry's full year 2013 outlook is slightly stronger than 2012, the improvement is expected to occur in the second half of the year. In the second quarter, we expect lower manufactured volume compared with last year. Higher production costs associated with interim Tier 4 will have an impact in the quarter, as well as global growth expenses.","Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 17 shows the financial services provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average owned portfolio at 31 January, 2013 was one basis points reflecting the excellent quality of our portfolios and recoveries from prior year's write-off, our 2013 financial forecast now contemplates the loss provision to be about 16 basis points as a percentage of the average owned portfolio. The 10-year average is about 27 basis points.","Moving to slide 18, worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $133 million in the first quarter versus $119 million, last year. For the full year, net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $540 million.","Slide 19 outlines receivables and inventory. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter up about $1.2 billion, or approximately 30% of trailing 12-month sales, the same relative to one year ago. The increase year-over-year is predominantly Ag, mainly reflective of higher sales volume. The C&F increase is mostly related to Canadian consigned in Nortrak's inventories. This occurred as dealer rebuilt their inventories prior to the current caution in the market.","We expect to end 2013 with receivables and inventory up about $500 million. The increase from our prior forecast relates to a stronger large Ag market in the U.S. and Canada, strong markets in South America and better definition to our final Tier 4 engine transition plan. Our guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on slide 20, remains at approximately 74% in 2013. Factors affecting cost of sales include price realization, production and manufacturing costs, raw material costs, engine emission product costs, absorption and effects of foreign exchange.","For modeling purposes, keep in mind, price realization, we are forecasting about three points in 2013. Interim Tier 4 product costs that we've talked about the last two years, lower production than in 2012, reflecting a much lower inventory build than last year, which affects absorption and the impact on cost of sale from new employees. In keeping with our growth plans, Deere hired an additional 5,000 people in 2012 with over 3,000 of them joining us in the last three quarters of the year. These additions are critical to support our growth both domestically and internationally and will impact cost of sales, R&D and SA&G in 2013.","I want to quickly run through January retail sales. Unfortunately, the AEM numbers were released too late to incorporate into our slide back. For utility tractors, industry sales were up 12%. Deere sales were flat in the month. Industry inventory for the utility tractors for the month of December were 48% of the previous 12 month sales. Deere inventories were lower. Industry sales of row crop tractors were up 27% in the month. Deere sales were up double digits but less than the industry. Industry row crop inventories for December were 28% of the previous 12 month sales. Deere inventories were lower than the industry.","Moving to four-wheel drive tractors, industry sales were up 89% while Deere sales were up triple digits. December industry inventories were 21% of previous 12 month sales. Deere inventories were slightly higher. For combines, industry sales in the month were up 17%. Deere sales were up more than the industry. Industry inventories for December were 11% of the previous 12 month sales. Deere inventories were slightly lower. Deere dealer inventories at January 31, 2013 for row crop tractors were 19% of previous 12 month sales compared to 12% in 2012. Comparable numbers for combines are 11% at January 31, 2013 versus 5% in 2012. The remaining industry sales for Ag and Turf, the EU27 and C&F can still be found in the appendix of our slide deck.","Now back to the slides. Looking at our R&D expense on slide 21, R&D was up 14% in the first quarter compared with the same period last year consistent with our guidance that the increase in R&D spending for 2013 would occur in the first half of the year. Our 2013 forecast continues to call for R&D expense to be up about 3% for the full year.","Moving now to slide 22. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up about 10% in the first quarter. Very much like R&D, the quarter-over-quarter increases for SA&G are heavily weighted to the first half of the year. In fact about 70% of the SA&G increase will occur in the first two quarters. SA&G expense is forecast to be up about 7% in 2013, no change from our previous guidance.","The equipment operations tax rate was about 30% in the first quarter with the rate affected by discrete items. While it is not our practice to provide specific of discrete items we would note the extension of the R&D tax credit for 2013 and it's being retroactive to 2012. For full year 2013, the effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%, representing no change from our previous forecast.","On slide 24, you see our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. We continue to forecast cash flow from equipment operations to be about $3.4 billion in 2013.","On slide 25, we outline our 2013 outlook for the second quarter and full year. Our net sales forecast for the second quarter is up about 4% compared with 2012. This includes about two points of price realization with unfavorable currency translation of about one point.","A couple of other items to keep in mind as you model the second quarter. As we stated previously, R&D and SA&G expense are front-end loaded costs affecting our year-over-year second quarter results and in last year's second quarter results were favorably impacted by a reduction in pension and OPEC expense of approximately $65 million. The full year forecast now calls for net sales to be up about 6% compared with 2012. Price realization is expected to be positive by about three points. We have increased our full year 2013 net income forecast to about $3.3 billion.","In closing, John Deere has entered 2013 on a strong pace. Our key markets remain in good shape for the most part and we are looking for another solid year. True, our near-term outlook is tempered by uncertainties over fiscal, economic and trade issues. This is hurting business confidence and restraining growth, but we continue to invest in the future as the longer-term picture continues to be extremely bright.","Our plans for helping meet the world's growing need for food, shelter and infrastructure are well on track and moving ahead. All-in-all, we remain highly confident about the company's future prospects and our ability to deliver value to customers and investors in the years to come.","Tony?","Tony Huegel","Thank you, Susan. Now we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. But as a reminder, in consideration of others, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. If you have additional questions we ask that you rejoin the queue. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz, and please state your company name.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays","Good morning, guys. It's Barclays. Nice quarter. If we could talk about construction first, can you talk a little bit more about your comments around emerging caution from dealers? To me it sounds a big counterintuitive, you know, having going the right way. Is the rental market slowing down for you and you didn't mention energy and material handling you as a strength which you have in the past?","Tony Huegel","Yes. We would actually. In terms of strength, where we are strength, we would continue to say the key areas, rental continues to be stronger energy related as well as material handling. That really hasn't changed. I think, where the ready outlook has changes, we are seeing some caution around some of the uncertainties around fiscal policies and particularly impacting our Construction & Forestry business, and dealers in particular, I think also are cautious. And as a result, they are beginning to pull down their inventory somewhat.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays","Okay. I bet other people ask you about that. Tony, if I could ask you about your guidance, you maintained your guidance of 74% cost of sales. You did 74% in the quarter, we were modeling something worse. It seemed like you executed quite well in the context of although that's your employees that came in the beginning of the year or at the end of last year. So, why wouldn't margins go up toward the end of the year, that cost of sales number go down, you production of combine should be going up at least modestly and you would better absorb those employees, especially considering price cost should be relatively good this year.","Tony Huegel","Right. Actually you touched on one of the reasons with combines shipments. Keep in mind that last year we actually had the opposite phenomena and in the sense that we were producing and shipping a higher than normal percentage of combines in the back half of the year. And in 2013, we'll be moving to what would be a more typical shipping pattern on those combines, so we are seeing a lot more being shipped in this first half. Especially in the first quarter, we saw more combines shipped versus last year.","In fact last year was like maybe about 10% the combine that were of the annual shipments of combines went out in the first quarter, and Europe closer to 15% to 20% in the first quarter this year, so it's a big shift.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays","Okay. Thanks, Tony.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook, and please state your company name.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Hi, Good morning. Credit Suisse, and sorry just to follow-up to Andy's question on the C&F side, I guess two questions. One, I mean, Tony, when you look at your forecast on housing, it's up a little, non-res is down a little, so your economic forecast really hasn't changed that much, so I guess my question is, is this more Deere specific and that that you had too much inventory in channel and you are making some adjustments that other people made before and just what's the level of dealer inventory out there I guess needs to get cut.","My second question is, I am pretty sure you said margins are still 8% in C&F on a lower sales forecast, and I just wanted you to confirm that, and then how were you able to achieve the same margins on a lower sales increase? Thanks.","Marie Ziegler","Sorry, Tony, our (inaudible). So Jamie, we are really tweaking our inventories on that construction side. If you look at the ending guidance, its down hundred and some million dollars from our previous outlook. So it is really tweaking but again, in the field, we are seeing a little slower rate in terms of inventory growth and that is just what you are seeing in terms of inventory ordering. So you are seeing that reflected in a little bit of caution in our outlook especially for the second quarter.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","But I guess, Marie, do you feel like you guys were a little late on the inventory reduction relative to some other guys? Or you were just more cautious? Is it marker or is it Deere? I guess I am still not.","Marie Ziegler","I think if you are comparing us to another company, you know we are talking $100 million, $200 million, not dramatic changes relative to others. So I think you are talking more tweaking but nonetheless that shows up in our sales guidance.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Okay, fine, and then just on the margin question, Marie. Thank you.","Rajesh Kalathur","Hey, Jamie, this is Raj. Just on the C&F inventories, we are essentially up, C&F inventories versus receivable to about $200 million for Q1 primarily because we have a stronger market in Canada for construction and we have consigned inventory in Canada. Okay, that\u2019s what went up. Now we are taking it down. The reduction in the C&F forecast, we like taking it down and that is reflected in, as Marie said, inventory versus receivables going down almost nothing by the end of the year.","Tony Huegel","Remind us about the margin question.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Yes, I think you said margins are the same and I think your sales forecast is a little lower.","Marie Ziegler","Debt to EPS C&F margin is the same.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","I think that your Tier 4 class assumption's are lower. Is there anything else driving that or not? Because it seems to me, the mix isn\u2019t going to help your sales forecast. All right, maybe I am splitting hairs.","Marie Ziegler","There is no big story there other than I think a good attention to the level of expenses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann and please state your company name.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies & Company","Hi, good morning, it's Jefferies. I was hoping, we could just have a bit of an update on where the order books stand and for any programs you might want to highlight and then curious about what you are seeing in the used market as well?","Tony Huegel","I assume you are referring on the order books in U.S. and Canada on Ag.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies & Company","Yes, please.","Tony Huegel","Okay, yes. Basically, they continue to be very, very strong. I am looking for the exact data here.","Marie Ziegler","And while Tony is looking and that\u2019s really reflected in the improved guidance for North American Ag where you see us taking it flat to up 5% for the industry where we have been flat before and that is driven almost exclusively by large Ag. Tony?","Tony Huegel","Right, so specifically on early order programs and these are for the order programs that were active during the quarter. So excluding cotton and combines and sprayers ended during our fourth quarter. So, outside of that, we are still low double-digits year-over-year on the early order program. So that things like self-propelled windrowers, forage harvesters, as well as planting equipment. Our combine early order program ended in mid-January and was for the U.S. and then February 1 in Canada but very, very strong and we have virtually all of our production covered with the early order program.","On tractors again, our order window is open about seven months and track tractors in particular, are very strong. Both 8 and 9 track tractors are affectively sold out during that order window. In both cases, keep in mind that\u2019s with additional capacity for U.S. production. On the 8R wheeled tractors, the effective availability is late June. Again on additional capacity, over 2012 and on the 9R wheels, there is availability in April of this year which is similar to where we were last year. So, across the board very comfortable to where we were last year, but on higher capacity for the U.S. and Canada.","Rajesh Kalathur","On the used equipment, now what I can comment, Steven is, the combines is one that everybody picks up typically, value of the price levels are holding very low, inventories and turns are in decent shape as well. Now, when it comes to tractors [crops] were in very good shape and all those key parameters four-wheel drives, given the retail sales we have had, we are very comfortable with the inventory levels and the turns we have on four-wheel drives. Pricing is holding very well as well.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies & Company","That's great. And just quickly, the increased capacity that you spoke of, Tony, can I think of that as 15%-ish?","Tony Huegel","It's in the 15% to 20% range on tractors.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies & Company","Super. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan. Please state your company name.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Hi. Good morning. JPMorgan. Can we talk about Ag and turf for a little bit? I was surprised you kind of lost over the unfavorable impact on margins this quarter. Can we get a little bit more detail, particularly on the warranty costs? Is that just accruals? Is it actual costs? Where are they coming from? And then production costs and R&D also.","Marie Ziegler","Let me start with warranty. Ann, as you know Deere has extremely high product quality. And in fact over the last decade, we've taken our warranty rate actually down by about a third, so we are doing very good in that. You are well aware as I am sure everyone is, that we have had because of IT4, a record number of product introductions in a compressed time. And it's good as our product or occasionally we have to make a few corrections and so this really just relates to the fact we've had this huge number of product introductions. And when you launch something new, you occasionally have to make a few fixes, so no big story there.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Okay. So, are we done with those warranty costs now, or they are headwind for the remainder of the year?","Marie Ziegler","We would expect that you might see a little bit of an increase in the run rate as you move forward again just reflecting on the launch of product. In any other quarter, it wouldn't have even shown as factor to explain the quarter's results. It's just that we had relatively low sales volumes in the first quarter, so it's a little more apparent.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","That's fair point. Just a little bit more philosophically kind of around the warranty costs, or Tier 4 interim. You are the only company that's really calls out the transition to Tier 4 engines quarter-after-quarter is being a headwind. Is there any case to be made that that's because you are EGR first then going to SCR, whereas most of the rest of the industry both, construction and Agriculture went primarily to SCR or how should we as investors think about your struggle with this transition relevant to as peers?","Marie Ziegler","Excuse me, Not a struggler, actually a very, very good execution. We just want to help you understand that there are costs associated with this product cost in addition to the R&D and the capital expense associated with it and that's helpful in understanding our margins. We've done a very good job on cost recovery and we have added a significant amount of value to our customers. Because as we've discussed in the past, the product introductions are around IT4, so in addition to getting the emissions upgrade, we are getting a tremendous amount of features and values.","Rajesh Kalathur","So, let me reiterate something here, Ann. In terms of investments for our emissions, no. We are making dollars and I think we are talking about those. Our competitors have costs as well, okay? So it's not cost that only Deer is seeing. Others are seeing it as well. And, like Marie said, our implementation is done very well and we are looking forward to keeping that momentum FT4 transitions as well coming up '14 and '13.","Tony Huegel","I would also reiterate, compared to some of our competitors if you look at our overall margin, I think we are doing fairly well.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","I will leave it there and get back in line. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Crawford and please state your company name.","Eric Crawford - UBS","Hi, good morning, UBS. Wanted to touch on the South American outlook. Clearly seeing some strength in Brazil but I am curious how the competitive dynamics are playing out. Are you seeing room to tick up pricing more than you originally planned and you expect your share in combines, perhaps, to recover after it took a dip?","Tony Huegel","Yes, and certainly as we look at our pricing, again in Brazil. we continue to have positive price realization year-over-year, again in the first quarter. We had positive price realization. I think for us, as you are aware, we have introduced a number of new products in to that market and they have been very, very successful. We have talked for a number of years about the strength of our distribution and I think as you see the market shares shift, that just further demonstrates what we have been saying regarding the strength of that distribution.","So again we are very positive about that regarding combines. Certainly we would hope to see the recovery and keep in mind, it is a pretty small drop in the year on combine market share but we would certainly expect to continue to recover from that and perhaps even extend our share further.","Eric Crawford - UBS","That\u2019s fair. If I could just as a follow-up on CIS. You didn\u2019t say credit being a factor. So is it safe to assume that it is not having an impact or is it just that there has been no change there and in light of the higher import duties has you longer-term view on that market changed at all?","Tony Huegel","Yes, certainly with credit I wouldn\u2019t imply that by lack of discussion that it isn\u2019t an issue because certainly there is some tightening of credit and in CIS countries. We talked about it last quarter. Really it is just the more significant change would be around the import duties, specifically on combines that were added. Keep in mind that really begins in mid-February and runs through June currently.","Marie Ziegler","July.","Tony Huegel","Oh, its actually July, I am sorry. And then there will be a determination of whether that gets extended or not. So it is probably premature to talk about what kind of long-term impact that may have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten and please state your company name.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Longbow Securities. Good morning, everyone. Can we just talk a little bit more on construction equipment and a little more color, I think indicated second quarter productions are going to probably trail last year numbers and Brazil has some tax on imports of construction equipment. Is part of the reduction in forecast due to some of the tax there and Brazil also? Or can you go back second quarter production versus last year? And do you think it is going to change?","Marie Ziegler","I am sorry, Eli, I cut you off.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Is most of the drop in production for the 3% gain in CIS coming in the second half of the year?","Marie Ziegler","So the drop in the second quarter is really exclusively related to North American construction and then there is also some forestry activity. In Brazil, indeed we are actually building our presence. So although there are tariffs, as you know we are entering that market. We have got a dealer network that we are supporting with equipment sales, imported equipment sales prior to the launch of production in our factories which will really be '14 and 2015 event. So it has nothing to do with Brazil and it\u2019s a tweaking in North America as we talked about earlier.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Okay, and so as a follow-up, you mentioned nothing about material cost this year. There is actually a tailwind versus last year. We are approaching final Tier 4 next year in '14 and '15. Can you give us some insight on how it is going to affect Deere, and some of your larger equipment and in Ag, you will probably after you introduce final Tier 4 next year? So how that incremental cost would be as we get closer to that date?","Tony Huegel","Sure, and I want to make sure that I am separating the two because we talk about in the past about material cost and then we have talked about interim Tier 4 material cost. As we mentioned, in the first quarter material costs excluding IT4, it is not a material impact, either positively or negative in terms of driving any change in that cost of sales percentage.","On interim Tier 4, certainly that is an impact, the emission cost, if we look at unfavorable factors impacting our cost of sales ratios, interim Tier 4 product cost would be the largest impact in this year. As you mentioned, we'll move into final Tier 4 beginning in 2014, and so you will start to see in addition to, you have your interims forecast to pretty much be completed, but you will start seeing final Tier 4 and that should be fairly similar to what we saw in terms of the ramp-up, not necessarily the total cost to what we saw with interim Tier 4 in that large Ag 175 horsepower equipment is the effective date of that that regulations is January 1, so you will start seeing large ago Ag go and then below 175 horsepower in 2015.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","So we see the cost beginning in the second half of this year, this fiscal year, beginning ramp up as we get closer to it?","Marie Ziegler","In first quarter you might see a little bit of the impact more as you get started with some demonstration models and things like that farm shows, but no it's really a fiscal 2014. You're also aware we talked about the inventories and receivables being a little higher on the Ag side than what original guidance have been. We will continue to refine our transition plan as we move through the year, so you can some activity there.","In terms of cost up, Eli, the bigger cost up was really to go from Tier 3 the IT4. Going to final Tier 4 well, is still cost up, is not quite as significant. I do not have precise estimates of the number, but as you said on a 10-point scale, if you are going from Tier 3 to IT4 was a 10 then maybe you are looking at 5-point, 6-point 7-point to go from IT4 to final Tier 4, but we are still, as you might imagine, working on that.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Thank you very much.","Marie Ziegler","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Rob Wertheimer, and please state your company name.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","Hi. It's Vertical Research Partners. Good morning, everybody. My first question is, did I understand on the Russia turf issue that's only on the combine side and did you build into your forecast that on tractors as well as that's something you expect?","Tony Huegel","Yes. At this point that import duty is only on combine and we are not aware of any change at point with tractors, so the outlook really is impacting combine alone. That impact as Susan pointed out, it's not just Russia, but that affects Russia and Kazakhstan as well as.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. Thanks. Then second just sort of a big picture question. Obviously the environment was strong in Brazil, I am curious about what kind of customers are buying the biggest sort of largest corporate firms there tend to buy stuff and use it runs all the way down. I don't know whether it's accelerating I don't know whether it's the development of used market in Brazil as they maybe accelerate, or whether it's mid-tier farmers who are buying more or smaller. I am just wondering if you can give just sort of a bit of color around about Brazil is evolving.","Tony Huegel","Sure. Certainly there continues be and it kind of depends on what industry you are referring to in terms of a typical usage. For example sugar industry tends to use both, tractors and harvesters very heavily on an annual basis. And to your point, with their holding patterns they tend to be pretty much ready for scrap by the time they are ready to the trade-in.","Grain industry is a little bit different and there is probably to best characterize maybe a bit of a developing used equipment market. Typically they are trading in every five years or so, but a typical grain farmer is putting fewer hours on than what you would see in the sugar industry.","So, our dealers do take trade there. In some cases, similar to the U.S. still have an in-house used equipment department to process those through. Some of them actually outsource it and have others take care of selling that used equipment. But again I would characterize it more as a developing issue or market versus what you would have in the U.S.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","Are you seeing strength amongst the very biggest, the big corporate ones and then large line holders and small as well anything that you can call about a lot of your customers? Thanks. I will stop.","Rajesh Kalathur","This is Raj. Let me broadly say that, some time back there was this Mais Alimentos program in Brazil that provided additional subsidies for smaller farmers and we have seen that that\u2019s peaked off and since then the national economics has determined essentially that the larger farmers are growing. Okay, and if you look at our own past experiences, these are very large farmers and in 2011, 2012 approximately 60 of these farmers who would contribute almost $0.5 billion worth of our revenues in that market. We have said that in the past.","If you look at the first quarter, we have a slightly higher proportion of large Ag sales in Brazil than in the first quarter of last year. So it is increasing especially for us towards large Ag and our proportion of large customers is increasing.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Casey and please state your company name.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Wells Fargo Securities. Good morning, everyone. First, just a clarification on the revenue forecast change. Does that include any modified currency assumption?","Tony Huegel","No, it does not.","Marie Ziegler","No.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, so all volume basically.","Tony Huegel","Right.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","And then second, within Ag and Turf, are you redirecting any combine shipments to other regions due to this increased import duty issue? And then is that removing some upside potential to margin driven by the richer mix implied in the U.S. and Canada outlook changes?","Marie Ziegler","No. There may have been some tweaking in terms of the timing of some shipments but I don\u2019t think given the relative size of the market you are not looking at a big, huge change on the combines.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, thanks. I will follow-up later on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joel Tiss and please state your company name.","Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets","I am back at Montreal. How are you doing guys.","Tony Huegel","Great. How are you?","Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets","All right. So just two things. One is, can you tell us if the profitability of the European Ag business was up or down in the quarter?","Tony Huegel","Unfortunately, we can't speak to profit margins in specific regions.","Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets","Whatever. All right, and why the big range on the tax rate? The 200 basis point?","Marie Ziegler","That\u2019s typical.","Tony Huegel","We typically have, in fact, that\u2019s been consistent with our range that we started the year with and throughout the year last year as well.","Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets","All right, I guess, as long as Raj is here, can you talk a little bit about the long term attraction of the forestry equipment business? It seems to be just bouncing around for the last 10 years and not really going anywhere.","Rajesh Kalathur","So the forestry business is a very important portion of our business. If you know, our long term strategy, and our 2018 aspirations, we have articulated that we have the growth businesses which are Ag and construction and the complimentary businesses Turf or Ag and forestry or constructions. So we think of that as an important contributor going forward in terms of being complimentary to the construction equipment business. In terms of longer term growth, we are not expecting as much from forestry as from construction. Tailwinds in construction is very critical for us. Tailwinds in forestry, we think are very modest. So we have been looking to get good SVA and not great top line from forestry going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich and please state your company name.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. It is Goldman Sachs. Tony, in Eastern Europe with your of facilities or manufacturer footprint there, it sounds like you are better positioned than most for a potential change in the tariff regime. Can you just talk about what kind of local content requirements would be needed for combines to be considered local when over what time period would you be able to configure your facilities there to do some assembly work in the region?","Tony Huegel","Yes. Certainly. Unfortunately now with any specific. We are currently working with the Russian government specifically in terms of what those definitions are and trying to ensure that we can move that direction if feasible and qualifies local production, but that's something that we are working through at the moment.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","And, Tony, can you comment on around what timeframe you would be able to execute that if you did reach an agreement?","Tony Huegel","It depends on how quickly you can reach an agreement and what that requirement would be that be, so it would be very premature to speculate on that.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And from a pricing standpoint maybe the answer is mix or rounding, but I am wondering if you can comment. Your pricing this quarter was 100 basis points lower than your guidance and you are looking for two points of pricing into fiscal second quarter accelerating back to 3% in the back half of the year and I am wondering if you could just step us through what's driving the versus your expectations in the first quarter and the mix improvement in the back half versus 2Q.","Tony Huegel","I believe, we talked about three points of price realization for the full year.","Rajesh Kalathur","It was 4 for the quarter.","Marie Ziegler","Four for the quarter, there is really not a story there. As you can see that we are unprepared to answer it nothing.","Rajesh Kalathur","Part of that Jerry is lot of rounding. You need to be careful about how we do this, right? so, more so story you will find is actually in rounding.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Gupta. Please state your company name.","Ashish Gupta - CLSA","Hi. Good morning. CLSA. I am maybe at the risk of asking you to rehash some things you already described, but it seems like guidance is implying something like 11% incremental margins for the equipment business for the second through fourth quarter's year-over-year and I realize you mentioned the combine production is more evenly balanced this year versus last year, but I was just wondering if there is anything else in there that would have sort of point to the deceleration incremental profitability.","Rajesh Kalathur","So, now Ashish, we need to re-provide guidance and the top line as you know 1% increments, so there is a range that you need to be careful about in terms of rounding 0.2 to 1.8, okay? And again, on the other hand, we provide guidance on net income $100 million increments, so you got to be thinking about the range there as well could be anywhere between $20 million $180 million. And if you look at our operating margins for Ag and C&F, we have said it's 15%, 8%, those have not changed. And now, we are also looking at in terms of effective tax rate 34 to 36. Now, Q1 what 30, because of a discrete item. Overall, we are saying it's going to be 34 to 36, and then given the uncertain economic environment around the world, you will expect some caution from us in crops at least so especially in the second half outlook. So, factoring these, I think you should be able to add up the numbers that we provided.","Ashish Gupta - CLSA","That's helpful, Raj. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Fleck, and please state your company name.","Adam Fleck - Morningstar","Good morning. I wanted to turn back maybe to the Western European market. We know that market continues to weaken. Are you seeing any competitive issues or pricing pressure you'd call out?","Marie Ziegler","No. The biggest change that we are seeing is really coming out of the U.K., which relates to the weather that we've talk already about, but it's a large one of the key markets in that part of the world and it is very, very weak. We're actually seeing some stabilization in the South, which is gratifying although stabilizing at very low levels. We actually had some strength in markets like France and even some growth in Germany. So, it's really is really the U.K. the unique phenomena related to the weather and resulting crop yields of last year and then concern emerging over what happened this winter.","Adam Fleck - Morningstar","But you are not seeing any increased attempts at marketing efforts or price cuts or anything like that in that particular weak market?","Marie Ziegler","Nothing out of the ordinary.","Adam Fleck - Morningstar","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful, thanks. Then just one more from me quickly. Your share repurchase activity dropped prettily sharp in the quarter. Is that just because of a more cautious economic outlook that you described or is there anything else there?","Marie Ziegler","Absolutely. I think you may recall that we ended the year with about $6 billion of cash and we said we had pulled forward some funding because we were concerned about the outlook for the risk on fiscal cliff, et cetera and consistent with that, we moderated our share repurchases and I do want to emphasize that share repurchase is a residual use of cash. This tends to be a high use of cash time for us in the first half of the year as well. So no story.","Rajesh Kalathur","This is Raj. Let me reiterate that our cash use priorities are the same. They haven\u2019t changed, okay.","Tony Huegel","Okay, thank you. Operator, I think we have time for one more call.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes across Ross Gilardi and please state your company name.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, Bank of America. Just on that cash flow prioritization. I know you clearly had a big quarter in Ag. What signals are you looking for to raise the dividend more substantially?","Marie Ziegler","Well, we do not ever comment on dividend policy actions. You know that we convey that over a long time. We desire to be known as a company that consistently and moderately increased dividends and that we have a targeted payout on average over a long period of time of 25% to 35%. If you look at the monies that we have returned to shareholders really since we began our share repurchase program in 2004, you are looking at about 60%. Some of that has been in the form of dividends. Some of it has been in the form of share repurchase.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks, and then just on a Section 179, do you think that had a big impact on demand in December? Is that borrowing from your first half 2013 outlook at all? Just could you clarify, is this is a one-year extension or is it been extended indefinitely?","Marie Ziegler","It extends through 2013. Actually, at the margin, we would view it very much so as additive because it is most significant in helping facilitate moving the used goods and that\u2019s obviously important in a mature market. So that was a favorable development for us.","Tony Huegel","I am sorry. Keep in mind, on new equipment, in terms of, for our farmer customer, by the time they realize they want to extend some tax shelter or take advantage of that quite often for us, our order book, especially on large Ag are extended beyond January 1 or December 31 and so they wouldn\u2019t be able to order and receive that equipment ahead of that December 31 cutoff to take a lot of advantage of new equipment.","Rajesh Kalathur","The recent Section 179 announcements came in the first week of January. So the previous November, December, this was after that November, December when the announcement came in. So, as Marie said, we are expecting an impact on the used equipment movement because it is this year and not in 2012.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just, could I ask one last question on China subsidies?","Tony Huegel","We will have to cover that in follow-up. Okay, thank you very much. In summary, just wanted to reiterate, obviously while our near-term outlook is tempered by uncertainties over fiscal, economic and trade issues, we have entered 2013 on a very strong pace and looking forward to another solid year. With that, we thank you for your participation in the call and as always, we will be available the rest of the day to answer any additional questions you may have. Operator?","Operator","Thank you and this does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines."],"7102":["Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call November 23, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Tony Huegel - Director, Investor Relations","Raj Kalathur - Chief Financial Officer","Josh Jepsen - Manager, Investor Communications","Analysts","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse Securities","Andy Casey - Wells Fargo","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Steve Fisher - UBS Securities","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital","Mike Shlisky - Seaport Global securities LLC","Tim Thein - Citigroup Global Markets","Mig Dobre - Robert W.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tony Huegel, Director Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Tony Huegel","Hello. Also, on the call today are Raj Kalathur, our Chief Financial Officer and Josh Jepsen, our Manager of Investor Communications. Today, we will take a closer look at Deere\u2019s fourth quarter earnings, our markets and our initial outlook for fiscal 2017. After that, we will respond to your questions.","Please note that slides are available to complement the call this morning. They can be accessed on our website at www.johndeere.com.

Josh?","Josh Jepsen","John Deere today reported solid financial results for the fourth quarter and did so in spite of the continuing impact of the global farm recession in difficult conditions in the construction equipment sector. As in prior quarters, our performance was helped by the sound execution of our operating plans, the impact of a broad product portfolio and our success in keeping the tight rein on cost and assets. For the full year, the company had earnings of $1.52 billion, a top 10-year. In our view, that\u2019s a noteworthy achievement in light of tough business conditions and certainly well above the levels we have experienced in previous downturns. For 2017, we are looking for similar overall market conditions with a slight decline being forecast for sales and earnings.","Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at the fourth quarter in detail beginning on Slide 4. Net sales and revenues were down 3% to $6.52 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $285 million. EPS was $0.90 in the quarter. On Slide 5, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 5% to $5.65 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 3 points. Currency translation was favorable by 1 point.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let\u2019s start with agriculture and turf on Slide 6. Net sales were down 5% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in most regions of the world, mainly in the U.S. and Canada. One notable exception was South America, which experienced higher sales led by Brazil and Argentina. Operating profit was $371 million and operating margins were 8.4% in the quarter. The increase in operating profit was primarily driven by price realization and to a lesser extent, by lower pension and OPEB expense, material and production cost.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let\u2019s look at some of the fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 7 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the large crop harvests in 2015 and consequently to lower commodity prices we are seeing today, our 2016 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 6% from 2015 levels. Moving to 2017, we expect total cash receipts to be approximately $367 billion, about the same as in 2016 as lower livestock cash receipts are offset by higher crop receipts.","On Slide 8, global grain and oilseed stocks-to-use ratios are forecast to remain at elevated but generally unchanged levels in 2016 and \u201817 as abundant crops are mostly offset by strong demand conditions around the world. Chinese grain and oilseed stocks have continued to increase in 2016 with supply, domestic production plus imports outpacing demand. Chinese stocks of grains and oilseeds now represent almost half of the world\u2019s stocks. Given these stocks are unlikely to be exported the world market is sensitive to any production setbacks or major geopolitical disruptions. World cotton stocks have now fallen for second consecutive season and to the lowest level in five seasons, reflecting lower planting and stronger global demand.","Our economic outlook for the EU28 is on Slide 9. Geopolitical risks such as Brexit remain elevated contributing to the outlook for slow economic growth. Farm incomes remain under pressure and is below long-term averages, especially after a poor harvest in France. The dairy sector continues to experience weakness although there are signs the market is bottoming out. As a result, industry farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be down about 5% in 2017.","On Slide 10, you will see economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In China, slower economic growth persists and ag policy changes are causing short-term uncertainty for most domestic and global markets. As a result, we anticipate lowered industry sales. Turning to India, the government continues to focus on reviving growth in the ag sector and improving farm incomes. The value of agricultural production is expected to increase as a result of normal rains after 2 years of below average monsoons. These factors are expected to drive increased industry demand in India.","Shifting to Brazil, Slide 11 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agri business. Ag production is expected to increase about 7% in 2017 in U.S. dollar terms due to recovering corn and the continued increase in ethanol demand. From a local currency perspective, the change is about 6%. Ag fundamentals remain positive and farmer confidence is at its highest level since 2013 due to improved political stability and signs of economic progress. We expect these factors to lead to higher industry equipment sales.","Staying in Brazil, Slide 12 illustrates the finance rates for ag equipment. Moderfrota rates announced earlier this year remain at 8.5% for small and midsized farmers and 10.5% for large farmers. The government\u2019s ongoing commitment to agriculture continues and indications of shifting budgets to ensure availability of funds for Moderfrota are positive signals for the farm sector in Brazil.","Our 2017 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 13. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be down 5% to 10% with the effects being felt in both large and small models of equipment. Still, there are signs that large ag market is nearing bottom as indicated by the fact that the decline expected in 2017 is less than we saw in 2016. The EU28 industry outlook is forecasted to be down about 5% in 2017 due to low crop prices and farm incomes as well as persistent pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be up about 15% in 2017, a reflection of the factors already discussed for Brazil as well as positive industry sentiments in Argentina. Shifting to Asia, sales are expected to be flat to up slightly with growth in India being the main driver.","Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be roughly flat in 2017 with Deere sales outpacing the industry. Putting this altogether, on Slide 14, fiscal year 2017 Deere sales of worldwide ag and turf equipment are forecast to be down about 1%, including about 1 point of positive currency translation. The ag and turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 8.5% in 2017.","Now, let\u2019s focus on construction and forestry on Slide 15. Net sales were down 5% in the quarter due to lower shipment volumes and higher sales incentive costs both mainly driven by the U.S. market. The U.S. and Canadian markets continued to be extremely competitive and the pricing environment remains challenging. The division incurred an operating loss of $17 million in the quarter due to higher sales incentive costs, an impairment charge for international operations of $25 million and higher production costs. The division\u2019s decremental margin was 33% for the full year.","Moving to Slide 16 and looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide. GDP growth is positive. Construction spending is increasing and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units again this year. In spite of these positive signals, the market demand for construction equipment continues to be weak. Factors contributing to the weakness have not changed dramatically over the past quarter. Conditions in the oil and gas sector, for example, continued to be slow. Also, construction contractors are delaying fleet replenishment because of the uncertain markets. Rental utilization rate declines persist, leading to a reduction in fleets and elevated levels of used inventory. Housing starts in the U.S. for single-family homes remain below the long-term average and multifamily home construction is slowing due to overbuilding in some parts of the country. On balance, Deere\u2019s construction and forestry sales are forecast to be up about 1% in 2017 with positive currency translation of about 1 point. Global forestry markets are expected to be roughly flat in 2017. C&F\u2019s full year operating margin is projected to be about 3.5%.","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operations. Slide 17 shows the provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. The provision at the end of 2016 was 23 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The 2017 forecast anticipates a loss provision of about 29 basis points, up somewhat from historically low levels of recent years. This puts the provision just above the 10-year average of 26 basis points though below the 15-year average of 34 basis points.","Moving to Slide 18, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $110 million in the fourth quarter versus $153 million last year. 2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company was $468 million compared with $633 million in 2015. The lower results for both periods were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, higher losses on residual values and a higher provision for credit losses. Also, remember that full year 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of our crop insurance business of about $30 million. Deere\u2019s worldwide financial services operation is expected to earn about $480 million in 2017. The outlook reflects lower losses on lease residual values partially offset by less favorable financing spreads and an increased provision for credit losses.","Slide 19 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the year down $517 million. They are expected to decline again in 2017 by about $250 million. For the year ahead, we expect to produce in line with retail demand for large ag equipment while under-producing in the small ag sector, which is mostly related to midsized tractors and other livestock related products.","Before getting into cost of sales, let\u2019s discuss the voluntary separation programs initiated during the fourth quarter of 2016 as part of efforts to improve our cost structure. As noted in today\u2019s earnings announcement, pre-tax expenses related to the programs were $11 million in 2016 and will be about $105 million in 2017, most of which will be incurred in the first quarter. These expenses are recorded in the period employees accept the offer. While the voluntary separation programs applied to salaried employees throughout the U.S., a vast majority of those accepting offers were within the equipment divisions. These costs have an impact on cost of sales, R&D and SA&G. Savings from the programs are expected to be about $75 million in 2017.","Moving to Slide 20, cost of sales as a percent of net sales for 2016 was 78% versus previous guidance of 78.7%, a result of structural cost reduction efforts. Our guidance for 2017 cost of sales is about 78%. When modeling 2017, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: an unfavorable product mix, overhead spending, and Tier 4 product costs. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point and lower incentive compensation expense. Please note that our cost of sales guidance is flat with 2016 in spite of increasing commodity cost, higher pension and OPEB expenses and lower volume.","Now, let\u2019s look at some additional details with respect to R&D expense on Slide 21. R&D was down 4% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. Currency translation had a negative impact of 1% for the full year. Our 2017 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 3%.","Moving now to Slide 22, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up 3% in the fourth quarter with commissions paid to dealers, incentive compensation, the voluntary separation programs and pension and OPEB expense accounting for 2 points of the change on a net basis. SA&G expense for the full year was down 5% with currency translation, pension and OPEB expense and incentive compensation accounting for most of the change. Our 2017 forecast on Slide 23 shows SA&G expense being up about 1% with a net impact of about 2 points from the voluntary separation program, currency translation and incentive compensation.","Turning to Slide 24, pension and OPEB expense was down $53 million for the quarter and down $200 million for the full year. The forecast for pension and OPEB expense for 2017 is up about $30 million. On Slide 25, the equipment operations tax rate was 32% in the quarter and 30% for the full year. The lower rate resulted mainly from discrete items. For 2017, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 33% to 35%.","Slide 26 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations was $2.9 billion in 2016 and is forecast to be about $2.5 billion in 2017.","The 2017 outlook for the first quarter and full year is on Slide 27. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 4% compared with 2016. This includes about 1 point of price realization and about 2 points of favorable currency translation. The full year forecast calls for net sales to be down about 1%. Price realization and favorable currency translation are each expected to be about 1 point. Finally, our full year 2017 net income forecast is about $1.4 billion.","Comparing 2016 and 2017, Slide 28 shows the high-level reconciliation of operating profit for the equipment operations adjusted for special items. Operating profit was $1.88 billion for the equipment operations in 2016 included were special items, which require consideration, a $75 million pre-tax gain from the sale of a partial interest in SiteOne landscape supply, impairment charges for the C&F operations internationally of about $25 million, and voluntary separation programs of $11 million. Adjusted for these factors, 2016 operating profit would have been $1.841 billion.","Based on the guidance provided for net sales changes in 2017 and operating margins by segment, the implied operating profit for the equipment operations is forecast to be between $1.7 billion and $1.75 billion. Included were the following items of note: voluntary separation program cost of $96 million related to the equipment operations, pension and OPEB expenses of about $30 million and other non-recurring cost of about $55 million. After adjusting for these items, implied operating profit for 2017 is in the range of $1.88 billion to $1.93 billion. On an adjusted basis, the comparison shows an improvement between $40 million to $90 million for 2017 even with lower sales volumes, which are projected to be down about 3%. The lower volumes negatively impact the 2017 forecast. When considering the special and non-recurring items as well as the impact of lower volumes, they show the company is continuing to deliver improved operational performance due in part to structural cost reduction initiatives.","I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Raj Kalathur, for additional comments.","Raj Kalathur","Thanks, Josh. Last quarter, we talked about our plans to improve pre-tax profit by at least $500 million through structural cost reductions by the end of 2018. These benefits would apply to 2016 volume levels. We expect to see the full benefit of the $500 million improvement in the year 2019 and beyond. These cost reduction efforts began in March of 2016 and contributed in excess of $90 million for the year 2016. The 2017 forecast includes an additional about $190 million of structural cost reduction.","Here is some detail about where the $500 million in improvement is expected to come from. Number one, structural direct and indirect material cost reduction is the largest contributor of improvement, roughly one-third. Now, this is the result of leveraging existing supplier relationships, resourcing and designing cost out of our products. Second, people-related costs are the second largest category of reduction, about one-fifth of the total improvement. The voluntary separation program that Josh discussed is a significant example. Other areas of improvement include changes to our variable pay structure especially under trough conditions as well as lower R&D spending and lower depreciation associated with lower capital expenditures.","Overall, our teams are making good progress towards the $500 plus million goal and we have confidence it will be realized. In conjunction with sound execution, disciplined cost management will allow us to continue delivering significantly better performance than in downturns of the past. And of course, these same factors will provide a continued benefit when market conditions strengthen. All-in-all then, we remain confident in our company\u2019s present direction and believe Deere is well positioned to provide significant value to our customers and investors in the future.","Tony Huegel","Thanks, Raj. Now, we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure and in consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Leon?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse Securities. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Good morning. I don\u2019t know where to start. I guess, Raj, I appreciate the incremental color that you gave us associated with the $500 million in the savings that you outlined, the $90 million \u2013 the $190 million in 2017. And you gave more color on sort of costs, you know what I mean, the $116 million, but can you just give us more color so for \u201816, \u201817 and \u201818, what are the total \u2013 what are the costs each year associated with the $500 million?","Raj Kalathur","So Jamie, we said for 2016, it\u2019s in excess of $90 million on an operating profit basis, okay?","Josh Jepsen","The benefit.","Raj Kalathur","The benefit. Yes.","Jamie Cook","Okay. But what\u2019s the cost?","Josh Jepsen","The cost associated with that.","Jamie Cook","Yes, I want the cost associated with those savings each year.","Raj Kalathur","And we have said the voluntary separation costs are the primary ones if you look at it and it\u2019s about $11 million in 2016, okay. In 2017, we have said that the benefits are an incremental $190 million and we have also said the costs are \u2013 was it, $75 million?","Tony Huegel","$105 million.","Raj Kalathur","$105 million in total, yes. So, $105 million in total \u2013 in \u201817. So, now there will be some costs, but you will realize that on the structural material and direct - indirect and direct material cost side, the costs will be pretty minimal. The benefits will be substantial. Okay. On the voluntary separation type programs, there will be a cost and we have told you a lot of it in \u201816 and \u201817, okay?","Tony Huegel","And as we go forward, Jamie, if there are significant \u2013 to your point, if there are significant costs similar to the voluntary separation, we will certainly call those out as those are incurred and try to keep people abreast of what those are. But at this point, I mean your question about 2018.","Jamie Cook","Yes, I was just trying to understand what was incremental to the $11 million and the $105 million that you had pointed out. Because last quarter, you said three buckets, SG&A, material costs, you know what I mean, so I was just trying to get more color beyond what you guys provided?","Tony Huegel","Yes, undoubtedly, there is some, but there is nothing of significance.","Jamie Cook","Okay, I will get back in queue. Thanks.","Tony Huegel","Okay, thank you. Next caller.","Operator","The next question comes from Andy Casey. Your line is open.","Andy Casey","Thanks a lot. Good morning and happy Thanksgiving early.","Tony Huegel","Thank you, sir.","Andy Casey","I guess I had question on financial services it looked like it took you about $10 million cash charge for impairment during the quarter. You guided contribution up for \u201817. Can you discuss what you are seeing in terms of dealer originations for operating leases? And whether it sounds like you are feeling more comfortable about the residual value risk going forward? Can you kind of talk about what you are seeing?","Tony Huegel","Sure. As you think about the maturities and so on with leases, keep in mind that we talked about this last quarter. We did have a significant level of maturities that occurred in the fourth quarter. In fact, if you look at October alone, the month of October in terms of what sales we had of matured leases, about 2x to 3x the typical months that we had. And again, that\u2019s on the sales side. So, we did see again on our maturity, a pretty significant peak in the fall. We will, as we go forward, as you think about lease maturities, you will continue to see some of those seasonal increases. So, as we mentioned before, you will see some increase in the spring generally and then again in the fall. So, typically our second and fourth quarters are the quarters that we will see those. But at this point, we would anticipate what we thought fourth quarter 2016 would be the highest peak from a maturity perspective. Certainly, we continue to see customers continuing to elect operating leases at a bit higher level than what we would have seen on a more historic basis. I think the current market conditions explain much of that. But I would also point out it isn\u2019t at some of the extreme levels that I have seen being reported. If you look over the last 12 months for example, so for 2016, if you look at just the retail financing of equipment, so comparing retail notes versus operating leases. Operating leases in terms of volumes coming in the door were about 25% of the total. That\u2019s up. Historically, we would be in the mid to upper teens. So, it\u2019s certainly at a more elevated level, but not to the degree or to the extent that some perhaps have reported. So, hopefully, it gives you a little bit of color on where we are at with the operating leases. But to your point, as we move forward especially when we get past second quarter with some of the changes that were made, at that point in time on the short-term leases, we would feel and then you are seeing it reflected in the forecast, a bit more confident on that front as we go into \u201817. Right, thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jerry Revich. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Happy Thanksgiving everyone.","Tony Huegel","Thanks, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","Can you folks talk about now that you have completed largely anyway that Tier 4 transition how much of the cost improvement that you are seeing in \u201816 and into \u201817 is from lower factory and lower procurement costs now that you are focusing on optimizing the cost structure on the products? How much of a tailwind is that dynamic for you over the 2 years?","Tony Huegel","Yes. I think that unfortunately a level of detail, I am not going to be able to provide. But as you think about it kind of on a higher level, I think it is worth noting we still have emissions transition cost anticipated. Some of that is final Tier 4, so we still have some Final Tier 4 conversions. But also keep in mind as we go into 2017, Brazil has a Tier 3 conversion. So, there will be some cost there. So, emissions does continue to be an increase year-over-year. Now, that\u2019s on the one side. To your point, a portion of what we have talked about with the structural cost reduction is going back to some of those applications on Final Tier 4 where we have first and foremost found the most reliable solution. Now going back and looking at, are there ways we can still clearly meet those requirements that do so on a less expensive basis and so that really goes to \u2013 and would contribute to some of that kind of a third of the cost reduction that we are targeting on product costs. A good portion of that does relate to some of the Tier 4 future savings we would hope as we take some of those costs out of products on a go-forward basis.","Jerry Revich","And Tony, just to clarify, the transition cost you mentioned there up in Brazil, but globally, they are down, correct because\u2026.","Tony Huegel","It would still be an incremental cost on a global basis. You remember, those costs generally don\u2019t go away. And you still have, yes, Brazil transitioning, you have other products on a global basis transitioning. You have got some forestry products in Europe. You would still have some smaller product in the U.S. that we will be going through some transition. China, we have gone through some Tier 3 transition. So, the emissions broadly speaking continues to move forward on a global basis and so that will continue to provide some additional cost as we go forward at least for the foreseeable future.","Jerry Revich","Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Raso. Your line is open.","David Raso","Hi, good morning.","Tony Huegel","Hi, David.","David Raso","My question is on pricing, obviously, the 3% was pretty impressive. We haven\u2019t seen that in many, many quarters. So, it maybe dovetails a bit into how you are viewing Deere Capital and the losses for residual values, but can you take us through a little bit, what are you seeing on pricing, the 3% for the quarter and maybe the pricing that you see in the order book and use pricing as it relates to the residual value thoughts for next year?","Tony Huegel","Yes. So, as you think \u2013 yes, when you think about the new pricing and specifically in the quarter, I would say it really is attributed to the discounting was down pretty significantly and you saw that coming through in the 3 points of price realization. And I would say that\u2019s particularly true for the ag business as we have talked about with construction, that continues to be actually the opposite story, that\u2019s the very challenged market from a competition perspective and a pricing perspective. With used pricing, I would say more of what we have said last quarter where we really have seen, I would say stabilization of that used pricing as we speak with dealers, much higher confidence as they are negotiating trade-ins, the value that they are able to put on that trade-in and what they feel they can accept. Keep in mind the challenge always on residual values is that\u2019s more about the wholesale perspective and the ability for dealers to purchase those \u2013 that used equipment coming off of lease and adding it to their used inventory level. So, we do continue to see some lower residual values on leasing and you saw that reflected in the results for the quarter. But again, I think the good news there is generally stabilization on that used equipment pricing.","David Raso","Okay. And if I can quickly ask, that SiteOne gain from last year, I believe you don\u2019t have any SiteOne gain in 2017 guidance. But given the secondary that\u2019s out there already, can you at least help us with assuming \u2013 can you give us some idea of the size of the gain essentially given where the stock is today versus May to calibrate there or is there any reason not to assume there is a gain, I guess, from the secondary?","Raj Kalathur","So David, there is a follow-on offering that SiteOne has come out with, but it\u2019s not in our forecast and that\u2019s probably all we can say about it. They are just doing for follow-on offering as one thing and actually doing it is the secondary thing. So, we don\u2019t want to talk about the probabilities of that.","Tony Huegel","And that will be updated \u2013 if and when it happens, it would be updated at that point in time.","Raj Kalathur","And it\u2019s not in our 2017 forecast right now.","David Raso","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Alright. Next caller. Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Steve Fisher from UBS Securities. Your line is open.","Steve Fisher","Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the pricing question, so it sounds like things are nicely stabilizing in the ag business, allowing you to get that 3% with the lower discounting. Just kind of curious why isn\u2019t that sustainable into 2017 given that you are forecasting a more moderate pricing benefit in 2017 or are you assuming that there could be some upside to that as the year goes on?","Tony Huegel","Well, again, I think the thing I would point out keep in mind that\u2019s a quarter-over-quarter difference that you are comparing what happened in 2015 to what happened in 2016. And then so we certainly didn\u2019t see the increased level of incentive that we perhaps would often see in the fourth quarter didn\u2019t repeat in 2016. So again, I think as you go forward, we are still focused on seeing good positive price realization across equipment operations and you are seeing that reflected in the forecast. So candidly, we are still in very low end markets, especially as you think about large ag equipment and so the price realization is I think fairly attractive given that perspective. But it\u2019s really driven I would point out by our ability to continue to innovate. You are seeing that in our R&D spend and now you are seeing the benefit of that as we bring innovative new product out, we are able to then see that in the form of price realization. And so I think again, I think it\u2019s a pretty positive story overall. Thank you.","Steve Fisher","Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Next caller.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ross Gilardi","Yes, good morning. Yes, I was just wondering, can you guys just talk more about how your early order program kind of finished out or is looking now in sort of the backlog by region? And does your current order intake reflect the 15% increase that you are forecasting for South America?","Tony Huegel","Yes. So, as you think about orders and keep my early order program primarily relate to the U.S. and Canada on large ag equipment. You see it in limited form in some of the other parts of the world. As you think about the combine early order program, keep in mind, it\u2019s still in process. So, that actually ends in January. During the quarter, we would have ended our second phase of a multiphase program. I would tell you the order intake there was very supportive of the forecast in that regard. And again on large tractors, we continue to be pretty much in line slightly behind on the 8R tractors, if you think about availability year-over-year, but again, very supportive order position on the North American large ag versus our forecast. As you think about outside and I think maybe the most significant one is Brazil in South America and I think the question there that we talked about last quarter was, how much of that is simply pull ahead of that Tier 3 conversion that I mentioned previously. And we are seeing strength in the order book beyond the January 1 date and so that really is why we are reflecting that higher level of sales for the full fiscal year. Certainly, you will see some strength in the next couple of months, this month and December, ahead of that Tier 3. But our belief is what we are seeing in the order book that, that strength will continue beyond December 31. So, the short answer to your question on South America is yes, we are seeing it in the order book.","Ross Gilardi","Thanks, Tony.","Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Robert Wertheimer from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.","Robert Wertheimer","Yes, hi, good morning.","Tony Huegel","Hi, Rob.","Robert Wertheimer","Are you \u2013 now that we have finished out the year, you have noted in the past, obviously how the 100 plus horsepower category isn\u2019t really big farming tractors anymore stuff has crept in. Can you give us a sense of what your high horsepower 180 and above or whatever you want to do is versus maybe the 2002 trough or how far down we are from peak on the 180-hp revenues?","Tony Huegel","Yes. Again, we don\u2019t break out the inventory levels and give quite that much detail. I think what I \u2013 I think what is worth, pardon me?","Robert Wertheimer","Revenues \u2013 what production was in revenues for you guys versus the prior peak in trough?","Tony Huegel","Yes. Again, we don\u2019t guide on what those levels are by product type per se. But I think when you think about the levels that we are seeing from an inventory perspective specifically with that 100 plus, we did end the year with higher levels of 100 plus horsepower tractors. But as you point out, that was almost all below the 200 \u2013 220 horsepower, what we call large ag and really in that 6,000 series type of product. And you see that reflected in our lower receivables and inventory next year for the ag division. Much of that is kind of that midsized equipment getting pulled down further in 2017. And some of that candidly as we ended the year up higher than we would have liked on the 6,000 in particular. We talked a lot about that issue in the past. As you think about large ag equipment, as we expected, we are producing mostly the retail on large ag equipment as we go into 2017 and that\u2019s I think reflected in that sales outlook.","Robert Wertheimer","Okay. Thanks, Tony.","Tony Huegel","Okay, thank you. Appreciate it. Next caller.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Shlisky from Seaport Global securities LLC. Your line is open.","Mike Shlisky","Good morning, guys. A lot of questions here, but maybe I will just touch on turf and utility on my question. I think you said that it should be flat in 2017 with Deere outperforming. Can you just give us more color as to why you might outperform, is there a change in dealership networks or new products there or anything I should kind of point to there as to why you might be better than the industry in 2017?","Tony Huegel","Sure. I think probably the biggest category or biggest reason there is simply the new products that we have in the market and we would expect those to help continue to provide some market share. So, that would be the short answer. Alright, thank you.","Mike Shlisky","Thank you so much.","Tony Huegel","Next caller.","Operator","Next question comes from Tim Thein from Citigroup Global Markets. Your line is open.","Tim Thein","Thank you. Good morning. Tony, just want to come back to one of the headwinds you have cited for ag and turf being product mix. And I know you used to provide that in kind of the basis point term. But I am not sure you can do that now. But just kind of thinking through your comments with producing in line in large ag and not in small, Brazil being up nicely, both of which you think would be positive for mix. So, maybe just put a little bit more color around that your expectations for product mix? Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Right. Generally, when we have talked about large versus small, we have also pointed out small really combines midsize and utility. And so what you are seeing in some of that underproduction, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of that underproduction is coming of that midsized product, which again from a mix perspective would be a bit more negative. So, as you think about year-over-year strengths and weaknesses in the business, you are still seeing a fair level of weakness in some of that mid to large equipment at least year-over-year with continued strength in the smaller end of the portfolio. So, that\u2019s just from a product mix perspective and given where South American volumes are today, that geographic mix wouldn\u2019t be as attractive as what it would be if we were in more normal levels. So keep in mind, their production is significantly down as well and so that does put pressure there. So, it\u2019s kind of a combination of those things. Volume candidly though, year-over-year volume for ag and turf is the bigger headwind, there is some mix impact as well.","Tim Thein","Alright. Understood. Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","The next question comes from Mig Dobre from Robert W. Baird & Company. Your line is open.","Mig Dobre","Yes, good morning everyone.","Tony Huegel","Hi, Mig.","Mig Dobre","A lot of questions already asked, but I am going to ask you a tax question, if you would. Have you formed some sort of a view or do you have any internal modeling as to how your tax rate might progress going forward if what Mr. Trump is proposing out there in terms of tax reform actually comes to be?","Tony Huegel","Yes. I am going to take that question and make it broader than just tax. And what I would tell you is the thing \u2013 the most important thing is anything that\u2019s being talked about in media and anywhere else is obviously speculation at this point in terms of what may or may not happen. And so certainly internally, we are evaluating different scenarios. So, the short answer to your question is the, of course, we are looking at what that impact may or may not be, but we are looking at all kinds of scenarios, because at the end of the day, we want to be prepared for whatever does become reality. But we are \u2013 at this point, it would be premature to talk about that publicly just because it would be pure speculation, so \u2013 but we do appreciate the question. Thanks. Next caller.","Operator","The next question comes from Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray & Company. Your line is open.","Brett Wong","Hi, thanks. Just wondering if you can talk to Europe a little bit since you haven\u2019t talked about that yet, I am just wondering kind of the drivers behind the 5% and what could indicate bottoming in the weaker dairy industry?","Tony Huegel","Yes. It certainly \u2013 Europe as you are well aware, it\u2019s always a mixed bag country by country in terms of where you maybe seeing some strength versus weakness. I will start with dairy though. I mean really what we are seeing there is in some of the dairy pricing, you are certainly starting to see some of that level \u2013 you see some periods where dairy pricing was up pretty nicely, but it\u2019s early. But again, I think that\u2019s what we characterize it as we did. There are signs that it\u2019s bottoming, that doesn\u2019t mean it bottomed or how soon things might recover, but that is a positive versus where we would have been even as early as last quarter incrementally in Europe. But if you think about more broadly, I mean clearly, I think maybe the two of the more noteworthy regions there, France, which is our largest market, went through a very difficult harvest and the harvest is down. Farm incomes are going to be lower. That\u2019s going to put pressure clearly on sales there, and coupled with that, as you are probably aware, there was a tax incentive program earlier in the year in France that did drive a lot of sales. And now while it\u2019s still in place, not a lot of income for those French farmers, so it\u2019s unlikely to have this anywhere near the type of advantages it did last year. So arguably, France would be a more challenged market. In the very short-term, I don\u2019t want to emphasize that, the concerns around Brexit and so on could \u2013 is expected to drive some benefit for the UK. You have seen exports of the used equipment become much more attractive with the FX shifts. And in the short-term we are likely to see some higher level of sales as most of those customers they are expecting that they still see some price increases as most manufacturers are importing into the UK. And so again, with the FX shift, that\u2019s likely to drive higher pricing and so they are buying ahead of that. So, there would be some benefit again in the short-term there. Longer term, obviously, that would likely have more downside than upside. So, I think those are maybe a couple of the more significant and especially when you throw the dairy commentary in the more significant pieces of Europe as you think about 2017. Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Tiss","Alright. I made it.","Tony Huegel","Hi, Joel.","Joel Tiss","Hi, how is it going? I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about your produce \u2013 your production levels, because just trying to understand how the volumes of the factories are moving. How much you under-produced retail in 2016 and I know you said you are going to produce in line with 2017 just so we can get a little bit of a sense of the production changes underneath the covers there?","Tony Huegel","Sure. Yes, I think \u2013 as you know I would start with while certainly being able to produce to retail in some of those large ag factories is a benefit year-over-year. I would stress we are still at really low levels. We have talked before about capacity being below 50% in most of those \u2013 really across the board in the large ag facilities. That wouldn\u2019t change with the ability to build to retail. Because keep in mind, while we did draw field inventories down last year, it wasn\u2019t as significant of a drawdown as what we experienced for example in 2015. So again, you get benefit, but it\u2019s not like all of a sudden, those factories are running at highly efficient levels. So, I think that\u2019s probably the most important thing to keep in mind. We haven\u2019t talked about the level of specifically what the underproduction was last year. But I think again, you are seeing that reflected in the overall outlook. If you look at the sales, while most of our markets especially our largest market down 5 to 10 on a retail basis, you are seeing our sales reflecting a more positive trend than that. And I think that\u2019s part of that story. So, probably not much more I can say on that, but hopefully gives you a little bit of additional color.","Joel Tiss","Am I able to sneak another half a question in?","Tony Huegel","I think we are going to have to move on. There is a large number of people still in queue. Yes, sorry. Thank you.","Joel Tiss","Thanks very much.","Tony Huegel","Next caller.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research Partners LLC. Your line is open.","Joe O'Dea","Hi, good morning.","Tony Huegel","Hi, Joe.","Joe O'Dea","Could you talk about the operating leases and when you see higher volumes rolling off lease in the fourth quarter, just what the experience was with where that equipment went, whether the farmers were leasing it, were then buying it? The dealers are absorbing it whether you took more of it than you normally do, but if we just think about that, is it proxy for dealing with higher volumes coming off lease moving forward?","Tony Huegel","Yes. I think in the quarter, we would have seen similar maybe slightly higher return rates. So, it wasn\u2019t a major shift towards customers or dealers keeping that equipment. So that kind of continued. But again, that\u2019s all factored in. Any of those shifts would have been factored into the impairment and loss in anticipation or charge that we would have taken in the quarter as we have through most of 2016. We continue to look out over the next 12 months at our lease maturities and based on more recent activity both the return rate and loss rate would book, what we think is an appropriate impairment on some of those future maturities. So, again, we would have \u2013 I think the key there is we would have reflected that already at least for the next 12 months in that outlook.","Joe O'Dea","Great. Thanks very much.","Tony Huegel","Okay, thank you. Next caller.","Operator","The next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is open.","Nicole DeBlase","Yes, thanks. Good morning.","Tony Huegel","Hi, Nicole.","Nicole DeBlase","Hi. So, just a question around C&F, some of your peers have talked about channel inventory still being too high and needing to work those down at the dealer level for the next several quarters. I am just curious how you view your current dealer inventory levels within the construction business?","Tony Huegel","Yes, to appreciate that question, we \u2013 as you saw really in our numbers for receivables and inventory last year, our dealers drew their inventory level down pretty dramatically in \u201816. As a result, while we are still on an inventory and receivable level bringing C&F down further, that\u2019s almost all inventory for C&F. There is very little receivable reduction in that division and it\u2019s really just reflective from a new equipment perspective, we think our dealers are in very good shape. Now, the good news there is if we ever do start seeing more positive trends in that market for us, I think we would be in a position where dealers would likely need to add to their inventory from current levels. So again, I think that\u2019s reflective of the good work the division and our dealers did in 2016 that we are able to put that type of forecast for sales in 2017.","Nicole DeBlase","And is it a similar dynamic on used inventory?","Tony Huegel","No. Used continues to be \u2013 and that\u2019s one of the drags we would continue to point to. I think Josh pointed out in the opening comments. Used continues to be one of those kind of weights or headwinds for that market. Certainly, our dealers aren\u2019t \u2013 we would argue probably in a little better shape than much of the competition, but again, that\u2019s a little harder to gauge as well, but certainly broadly for that market will continue to be a headwind.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay, thanks.","Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","The next question comes from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies LLC. Your line is open. Can you recheck your phone Mr. Volkmann?","Stephen Volkmann","Sorry about that.","Tony Huegel","There we go, okay.","Operator","The next question comes \u2013 sorry\u2026","Tony Huegel","We got it, yes.","Stephen Volkmann","So, just a question about how to think about your forecasting ability, I mean, obviously, a quarter ago, you kind of gave us an idea of the full year. We backed into the fourth quarter, which you then beat handily. And normally, I feel like you guys have kind of good visibility quarter out and things don\u2019t change too markedly. And I am just trying to figure out if that\u2019s changed or if you are maybe being conservative last quarter or just how I should think about your visibility relative to history?","Tony Huegel","And I am assuming that question is mostly targeted towards ag since that was the division that really had a pretty strong beat in the quarter. I would tell you from a sales perspective clearly, our sales were higher. Pricing again was the incentive spend just wasn\u2019t as high in the quarter. So, that was a big part of the \u2013 most of the beat. But as you think about even on a volume basis, we did see kind of broadly some better sales levels. So, it didn\u2019t come from all U.S. and Canada. It didn\u2019t come even to the extent that there was increases in U.S. and Canada, it was broadly across a number of products. So, it would be difficult for us to even call out unless we put a very long list together where that sales increase came from. And sometimes, we will have quarters where unfortunately everything kind of moves against us. And we have a lot of little things that add up to a big negative. This happens to be a quarter where we have a lot of little things that were positive that all added up to a pretty nice advantage for us.","Raj Kalathur","Steve, to add to Tony\u2019s comments, the price and discounts we talked about was beat, and then you also talked about higher volumes and then higher volumes coming from regions 4, 3 and 2 and region 4, multiple units, now had little bit higher volume and then better mix than we had anticipated, lower overhead spending, lower material costs, lower R&D, structural cost reductions beginning to pay off a little earlier. So, all those things added to our beat in the Q4.","Stephen Volkmann","Great. I appreciate that. Thanks.","Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Next question comes from Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Seth Weber","And happy Thanksgiving.","Tony Huegel","Thanks, Seth.","Seth Weber","Most of the questions have been asked. Just a real kind of housekeeping, is there any color on the impairment charge that you took in the quarter, the $25 million, is there anything you can anymore details you can give us on that?","Tony Huegel","The only other thing and you will see it certainly in the \u2013 when we release the K that it\u2019s almost \u2013 we talked about it being international. It really relates to both our Chinese operations as well as the joint venture in Brazil. It\u2019s roughly half and half.","Raj Kalathur","C&F.","Tony Huegel","Yes, for C&F. So again, yes, so, it\u2019s about $13 million related to C&F China \u2013 operations in China and then about $12 million related to the joint venture in Brazil. Thank you.","Seth Weber","That\u2019s all I have. Thanks.","Tony Huegel","Alright. We have time for \u2013 we will squeeze one more call in.","Operator","Thank you.

Thanks for squeezing me in and happy early Thanksgiving.","Tony Huegel","Yes, thank you.","Adam Uhlman","I am wondering, Raj, you had mentioned in your remarks that you \u2013 that there had been some changes to the compensation plans I believe if I didn\u2019t really hear that out. I was wondering if you could expand on how you are changing the incentives at the company and what that means for 2017 as well?","Raj Kalathur","Yes. So, this is for the short-term incentive. At trough, we had a maximum payout at 13% operating \u2013 return on operating assets that went up to 16% now. So, that\u2019s specifically what I was referring to.","Tony Huegel","And then keep in mind, we did increase historically \u2013 that would have been 12% last year for 2016, it went to 13% for 2017, we are bumping that up yet again to 16%. I will point out a slight increase at mid-cycle as well. Last year, we bumped it to 24% and that moves to 26%.","Adam Uhlman","Okay, thank you.","Tony Huegel","Alright, thank you.

Your lines have been placed on listen only until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tony Huegel, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you sir, you may begin.","Tony Huegel","Also on the call today are Jim Field, our Chief Financial Officer; Marie Ziegler, Vice President and Treasurer; and Susan Karlix, our Manager of Investor Communications. Today we\u2019ll take a closer look at Deere\u2019s first quarter earnings, then spend some time talking about our markets and the outlook for the remainder of 2012. After that we\u2019ll respond to your questions.","Please note that the slides are available to complement the call this morning. They can be accessed on our website at www.johndeere.com.

With this morning\u2019s first quarter earnings announcement, John Deere has started 2012 on a strong note. Income and sales both reached new records for the first quarter of the year. It was our seventh straight quarterly record. The improvement was broad based. Ag and Turf had another strong quarter and our other division Construction & Forestry and Financial Services contributed as well. Healthy demand for farm machinery continued to play a big role in our results.","But our performance also reflected the success executing our ambitious marketing and operating plans. Best execution is especially important right now as we are adding new products in global capacity at unprecedented rates. Finally, our full-year earnings forecast has been adjusted upwards and now stands at about $3.275 billion. All in all, it was a solid start to what is expected to be another strong year.","You may have noticed the slide that looks a little different this quarter. We\u2019ve moved slides we felt were only number updates to the appendix to allow more time for your questions. Now let\u2019s look at the first quarter in detail starting with slide 3. Net sales and revenues were up 11% to $6.8 billion in the quarter, net income attributable to Deere & Company was $533 million.","As we noted earlier, this was the company\u2019s seventh consecutive quarterly earnings record. Total worldwide equipment operations net sales were $6.1 billion, up 11% quarter over quarter shown on slide 4. Price realization in the quarter was positive by four points, while currency translation was a negative 1 point.","The company outlook is on slide 5. Second quarter net sales are forecasted to be up about 15% compared with the second quarter of 2011. This includes about four points of positive price realization and about three points of negative currency translation.","For the full year, net sales are expected to be up about 15% versus 2011. This includes about three points of negative currency translation which is a negative swing in currency translation of four points from our previous forecast. So effectively forecast volumes have increased by four points, all of which have been offset by exchange.","In addition we are expecting positive price realization of about four points. Remember our price realization excludes any pricing related to interim Tier 4 which is included in volumes. The full-year impact on operating profit from currency translation is negative, about $80 million. Net income attributable to Deere & Company is now projected at $3.275 billion in 2012.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let\u2019s start with Ag & Turf on slide 6. Sales were up 8% in the quarter, production tonnage was up 5%. Operating profit was $574 million resulting in an impressive 12% operating margins, the second highest margin for the Ag & Turf division in any first quarter. Price realization in higher shipment volumes benefited results, but were partially offset by increased production costs related to new products, engine-emission requirements and higher raw material costs.","Taking a look at Ag & Turf incremental margin, it came in at 5%. As we discussed on the call in November, first quarter incremental margins would be a challenge due to the timing of expenses and a very tough comparison to the first quarter of 2011. Importantly pricing offset material costs in the quarter including Interim Tier 4 product costs.","As the press release states, the improved operating profit for Ag & Turf was partially offset by increased production costs related to new products and engine-emission requirements. Those costs in the quarter were roughly $100 million. The additional expense was associated with a significant number of startups which resulted in higher capital spend, factory costs and overhead expenses. Included were costs of installing new equipment, training new workers and starting pre-production processes. Coupled with strong demand in the quarter, we experienced some inefficiencies in our factories. All that said, we met customer demand and delivered a 12% operating margin signifying very strong execution. The forecast calls for double-digit incremental margins for the remainder of the year.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let\u2019s look at some of the fundamentals affecting the Ag business. Slide seven outlines the US commodity price estimates that underlay our financial forecast. As you can see, US crop prices are forecasted to remain strong in the 2011\/2012 crop year, driven by strong global demand and tight supply. The assumption for more normal, higher yields next year accounts for the drop in crop prices in 2012\/2013.","Slide eight highlights cash receipts. 2011, US Farm Cash Receipts were at record levels, 16% higher than the previous record in 2008. The 2012 cash receipts number is down slightly from 2011\u2019s record level, but are still extremely strong. In our modeling, current year and prior year cash receipts are the primary driver of the equipment purchases. This bodes well for the Ag business and is translating into increased demand as illustrated by our strong outlook.","Our base case on acres planted and yields for the 2012\/2013 crop year is shown on slide 9. Driven by strong global demand and low carryover stocks, our base case calls for an increase in total planted acres this crop year. The increase in corn acres reflects a shift from cotton. Assuming moisture levels recover in the wheat belt, acreage will increase slightly and as a result of the extreme drought in West Texas, we expect patent acres planted to decrease in the 2012\/2013 crop year.","Keep in mind the forecast involving acreage and yield are very preliminary at this point and will be ultimately determined by weather and spring time prices.","Our economic output for the EU 27 is on slide 10. We see the European Ag sector strengthening with 2012 farm income expected to remain at very attractive levels supported by commodity prices. Equipment demand continues strong with a favorable outlook for large farm markets in Northern Europe offsetting weakness in the south. ","On slide 11 you will see the economic fundamentals outlined for few additional targeted growth markets. Slide 12 tells the weather related story for Argentina and Southern Brazil which serves as the basis for our outlook change in the region and the slide change from the farm net income slide you are used to seeing. Drought conditions in Central Argentina and Southern Brazil have lowered production and yields while heavy rain in Central Brazil has slowed the soybean harvest and the planting of the second season cotton crops.","Our 2012 Ag & Turf industry outlook are summarized on slide 13. With strong farm fundamentals in the US and Canada, demand continues to increase especially for high horsepower equipment. We have increased our forecast for the region to up about 10%. ","The EU 27 industry outlook has been increased and is now projected to be flat to up 5% from the attractive levels of 2011. The improvement is due to favorable conditions in the grain, livestock and dairy sectors, which are outweighing general economic concerns in Southern Europe.","Our 2012 industry outlook in the CIS countries is for considerably higher growth after last year's notable rise.","Moving to Asia, we expect sales to increase moderately. The tweaking in our forecast is a result of the tractor industry in India. After two years of strong double-digit growth the 2012 forecast for tractors is flat this year. Higher interest rates and moderating commodity prices are also dampening growth. We view this as only a pause in India as government support for agriculture and farm mechanizations are both on the rise. ","Industry sales of tractors and combines in South America are now expected to be flat to down by a percent, in relation to the strong levels of 2011 due to drought in parts of the region. Remember industry outlook for South America does not include cotton and sugarcane harvesting equipment, both categories in which Deere has a strong market presence. The Ag factor in Brazil continues to receive governmental support stimulating investments in Ag equipment. ","Turning to another product category, we expect industry retail sale of turf and utility equipment in the US and Canada to be up slightly in 2012. Putting this all together on slide 14, the fiscal year 2012 forecast is for Deere sales of worldwide Ag and truck equipment to be up about 15%.","Currency translation is negative by about three points, which is a four point negative change from our forecast in November. So effectively, forecast volumes have increased by four points. Operating margin for the division is forecast at about 15%, which would be a record and that despite the headwinds we discussed earlier. This certainly illustrates solid execution on our part.","To update you on our early order program. The combine early order program ended in the middle of January with about 95% of the production flat and covered. Concerning used combine levels, you may recall we made good progress in reducing the number of used units at year end. And we made still more progress in the first quarter. January ended with used combines well below year earlier levels with values rising. In response we added additional combine production to the schedule. This clearly demonstrates our confidence that we have effectively managed through this situation.","The cotton early order program is full. Remaining early order programs for air seedings, sprayers, planters, drill, tillage, windrowers and self-propelled forest harvesters have done exceptionally well. Aggregate orders for these programs are up about 30% over last year. The order booked for large tractors is also strong with effective availability of August 2012 for the AR model and June 2012 for the four-wheel drive 9R. All this of course are outlooks for a very good market conditions.","Let\u2019s focus now construction and forestry on slide 15. Deere\u2019s net sales were up 22% in the quarter while production tonnage was up 26%. Division operating profits rose 41% to $124 million, helped by higher shipment volumes and improved price realizations, partially offset by increased raw material cost. C&F recorded a 9% operating margin and 14% incremental margin.","On slide 16, let\u2019s look at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide. While stable or increased from last quarter, the underlying fundamentals certainly don\u2019t point to strong recovery. Overall economic growth continues at a slow pace although there are promising signs that things are picking up. C&F continues to benefit from replacement demand for very aged fleets and improved sales to independent rental companies as they record higher utilization levels and rental rates.","We also see strength in the energy and material handling sectors. The latter pertaining mostly to skid-steers and loaders. Also encouraging Deere dealers continue to see an improvement in rental utilization and used equipment market.","Net sales in construction and forestry are now forecast to be up about 18% in fiscal 2012 with negative currency translation up about one point.","Global forestry market are expected to be flat to up 5% in 2012 from the strong levels of a year-ago.","We\u2019re seeing growth in our all our markets except Europe, where the market remains healthy but restrained by economic concerns. The full year operating margin for the C&F division is projected to be about 8%.","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operation. Slide 17 shows the financial services provision for credit losses as a percent of a total average owned portfolio.","Year-to-date, on an annualized basis, the provision is at an incredibly low two basis points. This reflects lower write-offs primarily in the Ag and Construction and Forestry portfolio as well as recovery of prior year write-off in fewer repossessions. Our 2012 financial forecast contemplates the provision for credit losses, increasing to a more normal level, to about 24 basis points as a percentage of the average owned portfolio. For your reference, the 10-year average is about 34 basis points.","Moving to slide 18, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $119 million in the quarter, versus a $118 million in 2011.","Net income benefited from a growth in the credit portfolio, revenue from wind energy credit and a lower provision for credit losses. These items were largely offset by higher crop insurance claims, and increased selling, administrative and general expenses.","The wind energy credits relate to the wind energy business we sold in 2010.","Looking ahead, we are now projecting worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company of about $460 million in 2012. The decrease from 2011 with income worth $471 million is mainly attributable to few things. First the provision for credit losses rising towards more normal level, about 24 basis points for the year. Last years loss division was only four basis points well below average levels.","Second the forecast also includes higher, selling, administrative and general expenses in support of the equipment operation\u2019s global growth. For example financial services has recently added or soon will be adding locations in China, Russia, Chile, India and Thailand. Growth in the portfolio will partially offset these two items.","Now on slide 19 lets look at receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole the receivables and inventories ended the first quarter up about $1.6 billion compared to the first quarter of 2011 equal to 30% of trailing 12 months sales, the same percentage of trailing 12 months sales was achieved in the first quarter up 2011. Historically for the first quarter we were on between 28% and 30%. The higher first quarter inventory levels are necessary to meet the strong demand ahead of us this year. For the full year receivables and inventories are expected to be a $150 million higher versus 2011.","Let\u2019s turn now to raw materials and logistics. On slide 20, first quarter material cost were up about a $130 million in comparison with the first quarter of 2011. Our 2012 full year forecast now with an increase of around $400 to $500 million versus 2011, as we are seeing lower steel prices run through our cost about 80% of the increase is for for Ag & Turf and about 20% for C&F.","As we have shared in the past, increases or decreases in Deere\u2019s raw material costs tend to lag by three to six months depending on the commodity or type of contract. Our forecast calls for about two-thirds of the increase in raw material costs to occur in the first half of the year.","Finally, as we introduce new products and features to our growing customer base, the product cost of compliance with engine-emission regulations in North America and Europe will be roughly $500 million higher than 2011. However, the forecast for points of price realizations will offset the combination of increased material costs and Interim Tier-4 product costs.","Looking at R&D expense on slide 21, R&D was up 16% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Our 2012 forecast calls for R&D expense to be up about 12%. Currency translation is negative by about two points.","As stated in previous quarters, R&D spending is expected to remain at high levels for the next few years as we continue product launches within our Interim Tier-4 engines and soon thereafter meet Final Tier-4 emission standards. Also included is ongoing new product development expense for our growing global customer base.","Moving to slide 22, SA&G expense for the Equipment Operations was up 7% in the first quarter; growth accounted for almost all of the increase. Our fiscal year 2012 forecast calls for SA&G expense to be up about 10% with growth accounting for about four points and currency translation a negative two points.","Turning to slide 23, we detail our use of cash priorities. Deere\u2019s Worldwide Financial Services operations provides a strategic advantage in funding customer purchases, but only so long as we can access the credit markets on a cost effective basis.","One of the key elements to this end is maintaining of single A ratings which is our top priority. Rating agencies expect 12 months of debt maturities to be covered by cash and\/or on tax credit facilities. This also implies appropriately funding our pension and OPEB benefits which we have done proactively and prudently over the years.","Our second use of cash priority is funding value creating investments in our operations. As an example mentioned in the press release, over the last year we announced plans for seven new factories as well as expansion at existing factories.","Our third priority is to provide the common stock dividend. Overtime, we want to consistently deliver a series of moderately increased dividends while targeting a 25% to 35% payout ratio on average. We are mindful of the importance of maintaining the dividends and thus not growing at beyond the point that it can be comfortably sustained by cash flow.","Share repurchases are method of deploying excess cash once the previous requirements have been met and so long as such repurchase is viewed as value enhancing.","And on slide 24, you see our Equipment Operations history of strong cash flow. Following years of impressive cash flow performance, we are forecasting cash flow from Equipment Operations to reach about $3.5 billion in 2012.","In closing, the company started out 2012 on a strongly positively note and is looking for further improvement in the quarters ahead. Our recent performance and our positive outlook for the year is strong momentum to the company\u2019s plans for achieving increased growth and profitability in the future.","What\u2019s more? Our substantial investment in new products and additional capacity puts Deere on a sound footing to respond to any further improvements that may occur in key markets, now in the early stages of recovery.","These investments as you see summarized on slide 25, include the seven new factories referenced in the press release in emerging markets crucial to our growth, as well as significant expansions and modernizations now underway in the United States.","The added capacity will help the company capitalize on the world\u2019s increasing need for food, shelter and infrastructure and for the productive equipment needed to help produce it. These powerful trends in our deal have staying power and they represent nothing less than an exceptional opportunity for John Deere and its investors in the quarters and years to come. Tony?","Tony Huegel","Thank you, Susan. Now we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. But as a reminder and consideration of others, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Andrew Obin and please state your company name.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","","Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Just a question on your outlook, you guys guided first to a down Q1 versus last year. It also seems that production was a little bit lower in the Q1 than we were thinking, so more of it is being pushed back in the second half and then you also guided to lower costs, yet as I look at the increase, sort of Bell recovers to beat and lower costs that you guided to, so why would incremental production in your outlook not result in more earnings?","Jim Field","","Well, Andrew, this is Jim. I think one of the key pieces in that whole equation is this $80 million or in round numbers about $100 million of headwinds that we\u2019re facing on the currency side from a translation perspective. You know, if you, I think if you look at the increase in physical volume that we\u2019ve added after you strip out the FX, and you put normalized incremental margin assumptions on that and consider the other headwinds we\u2019ve talked about and then consider also this in round numbers $100 million of translational headwind, it seems to be a pretty reasonable outcome where we ended up.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","","And as follow-up question on Construction and Forestry; if we go back in the prior cycles, construction for us was a much bigger percentage of your revenue and profit as well. Given sort of the ongoing mix change in the company, do you think in several years, Construction and Forestry can go back to its historic percent of revenue and profitability would be similar to what we saw in the middle of past decade or has the mix changed sufficiently that we should just think about the company being different?","Jim Field","","This is Jim again, Andrew. Absolutely; it can, and the expectations is that it would and as you correctly pointed out, when you look at the last construction cycle, Construction reported the highest operating margin of any of our divisions and they would be shooting for operating margins that are very consistent with that going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz and please state your company name.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","Good morning guys, its Barclays Capital. Maybe I could follow-up on Andrew\u2019s question about the Construction in one sense and that is I mean you had almost 9% margins in the quarter and what usually is a seasonally a weak 1Q and you didn\u2019t change the guidance for the year. So I guess I am just trying to figure out why that is; and the incremental margins were also quite good versus where we saw it. So any help you can give us as to and maybe there is a little upside in your guidance now for the year?","Marie Ziegler","This is Marie, Andy. As you think about construction, they will have a season of the IT4 compliance machines over the course of the year and so you will see the cost of the product transition and the products cost reflected in their costs as we move through 2012 and that\u2019s the difference.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","So just shifting back to Ag, you mentioned inefficient season of factory in the first quarter and you know production was a lot less than your guidance. So I am just wondering how that improves overtime, you know why did 1Q production, why did it look weaker than you guys had expected it to be?","Jim Field","Well, keep in the mind, the inefficiencies in the quarter that we talked about with Interim Tier again going back to Interim Tier-4 transition, certainly are combined trends that we\u2019re transitioning as well as large tractors, our 9000 series tractors were transitioning during that first quarter. So that\u2019s part of what of what\u2019s driving some of those inefficiencies.","Marie Ziegler","And also the tonnage change that\u2019s merely just the shifts in a variety of products a little bit less in the first quarter a little bit more as you move through the year and that\u2019s pretty typical for us. The tonnage numbers then as many of you are aware of are not terribly precise.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","So Marie it\u2019s really just timing you are saying.","Marie Ziegler","Yeah, absolutely because we took our full tonnage up for the year.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook and please state your company name.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Two questions. One just back to the Tier 4, I just want to make sure I understood you correctly and it relates to Andy\u2019s question in construction. Is Tier 4 now $500 million, but you said you will cover all of it relative to before you said 475 and you would cover a good portion, so I am just trying to make sure I understand that relative to the comments you made about Andy\u2019s, the margin impact on the CNS business and then I guess my other question is you talked about just on the combine issue, it sounds like you are taking production up, is that all happening in the fourth quarter and how should we think about combine production relative to retail in 2012 now?","Jim Field","Sure. On the first question, interim Tier 4 costs as we look, you are right, we did bump that up a little bit to about $500 million for the year and as you look at the four points of price realization, what we\u2019ve said is that will more than cover the interim Tier 4 as well as the material price increases that we are anticipating for the year.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","But is that better than what you said last quarter? I think, I didn't think last quarter you were covering at all, so that's the disconnect I am trying to unless I am misinterpreting you.","Marie Ziegler","A little bit of a change, but not much.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","So it is better.","Marie Ziegler","It\u2019s a little better yeah.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Okay, so just with Andy\u2019s comments and why then it\u2019s going to, if you are more than covering it, why is it going to hurt your CNS margins?","Marie Ziegler","We are in production yet on a lot of the construction equipment. That has a phase in over the course of the year Jamie. So you are not seeing some of the Tier 4 product costs yet in the first quarter at the same level that you will in subsequent quarters just simply because we\u2019re launching products over the course of the year.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Okay. and then just the last on the combine, just if you are taking the production up in the fourth quarter and where we\u2019re going to produce relative to retail in 2012?","Marie Ziegler","Jamie, we don\u2019t have specific fourth quarter public guidance, but it is true that we add combines and I think you could say that some of those combines certainly would have been added in the latter half of the year.","Jim Field","This is Jim, I think relative to the combine issue which was yesterday\u2019s headline, I think the important thing is that we\u2019ve reached closure on this issue. We\u2019ve got the channel where we think it needs to be in terms of used goods and I think it also shows the type of actions that we will take as a company to make sure that this is a long-term sustainable business. So I think that\u2019s the important thing as you look at the combines situation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Henry Kirn and please state your company name.","Henry Kirn - UBS","Wondering if you could chat a little bit about where you think we are versus normalized demand in South America and Europe?","Jim Field","Well certainly in Europe from a normal or mid cycle while you know we\u2019re continuing to look at it kind of flat 5%, we would still be below mid cycle levels within the company in Europe.","Marie Ziegler","And in South America, as we look to South America we see a very exciting opportunity as that market continues to grow and as we and as Deere individually continues to broaden in its market coverage with product and with distribution.","Jim Field","And I think as you look at Europe, I mean the important point there is as was said by Tony, we are below mid-cycle. We have seen some strength in that market. As matter of fact if you look at tractors, the order book is up 12%, combines 25%, Self-Propelled Forage Harvesters 17% and that\u2019s all happening in the market where there is a still in our view, a significant amount of headroom vis-\u00e0-vis mid cycle.","Henry Kirn - UBS","And dovetailing with that, can you update your thoughts on the steps you are taking to improve the market share in both those regions?","Marie Ziegler","He is asking about market share. We could not hear you Henry, but I believe your question was what steps have we taken to improve market share in both those regions, is that correct?","Henry Kirn - UBS","Yeah, that\u2019s right. Update the thoughts on the steps you are taking to do that?","Marie Ziegler","When you were in Lisbon in the summer you saw over a 100 new products that have been introduced in Europe to broaden the market coverage. In that market we are continuing to add and strengthen our dealer capabilities. We have added parts capabilities throughout really well Europe and far into the CIS. And really the same is true in Brazil and South America where we continue to add again additional dealer locations and we have had a very significant broadening of the product line and that\u2019s already been reflected if you look at market shares.","Jim Field","Right and Marie mentioned the distribution network and in addition to the products certainly we have talked a lot about continuing to strengthen our distribution network. In Brazil, we would say our distribution actually is very strong and I think you have seen that reflected in the market share gain as we brought that new product. We have seen those market share gains and that is reflective of both sides of that equation and we will continue to work on those same concepts in Europe as we move forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer. And please state your company name.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","Just wanted to circle back to inventory. I mean, you talked about inventory receivables. But if you look at inventory on a standalone, it looks to me like your turns were the worst in ten or 15 years, either forward-looking or sales are backward looking. And I just wanted to make sure you\u2019re not having any production hiccups with Tier 4, anything sort to explain that or maybe I\u2019ve got the arithmetic wrong.","Marie Ziegler","","There is absolutely no production hiccups with, the Interim Tier 4 has gone very smoothly. But that said, year-over-year, Rob, we have a very different book in the first, where we ended the first quarter in terms of our production. So it is somewhat difficult to make a comparison because last year we were in very high production. In the first two months of the quarter this year, relatively low levels of production because of the significant turnover that we had in our production on combines and on large tractors.","Jim Field","","So a great example of that, Rob, is if you look at the harvester works, last year the schedule was very heavy in the first quarter which would have drawn down a lot of that inventory. This year, we\u2019re facing a schedule that\u2019s accelerating as you went into the quarter which means you\u2019re building the inventories and so obviously, when you look at the end point, you get a different equation.","But I would definitely underscore what Marie is saying. As a matter of fact, we\u2019re not having any production difficulties and as a matter of fact, we\u2019re very, very proud of what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish with these major number of new products coming off the line and the efficiency levels of which we completed with.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. I mean you guys have been great on inventory for a long, long time. It just seem like an outlier, even relative in the sales ramp. But, just one quick follow up if I may, do you have the, I know you will not disclose this quarterly or anything but the construction mix and geography, it looks like the volumes are back at least on a quarterly basis above peak. I know you have gained share. I know you are expanding geographically. I just don\u2019t quite know how to think about which of those is predominant?","Marie Ziegler","Volume? We are not even back to mid cycle volumes in that division.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","In the US, okay.","Marie Ziegler","The forestry business is which is 20% to 25% of the business as we have said has been stronger and it is taking a little bit of apart, but in the construction business which the bulk of it is still in the US, that\u2019s been very weak, it\u2019s been recovering from an extremely low level, but they are nowhere near mid cycle.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","Okay it is just a 1Q number, but I got it.","Operator","Thank you our next question comes from Andy Casey. And please state your company name.","Andy Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","A question on the cadence of the outlook for the remaining three quarters and Ag & Turf incremental margin. You are looking for a roughly 21 % with the numbers that you gave, is that more back half loaded than what we normally see in Q2?","Jim Field","I think you\u2019ll see I mean again our seasonal shipping in Ag & Turf is returning to a much more traditional pattern this year versus what we would have seen last year.","Andy Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","And then on construction and forestry I think in the last call some of the muted margin expectations were talked about as being caused by production ramp up and I am wondering if you are seeing an impact from the production capacity expansion in international markets this year or if that is more a 2013 event?","Jim Field","Yeah, most of that's going to be 2013 event when we look outside of the US and Canada. Of course we have talked about the factory in India is producing but its on relatively low levels at this point but it will ramp up as we go through the year but again most of that is a 2013 event.","Andy Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Not a production standpoint.","Jim Field","No, obviously we are incurring costs related to that geographic expansion which are in fact reflected in the \u201912 numbers and is I would say vis-\u00e0-vis a steady state has suppressed that somewhat.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Volkmann. And please state your company name.","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies & Co","It\u2019s Jefferies & Charge-offs. I guess, maybe you just answered this but I was thinking also about all about your coming online and some of the costs that are going to be ramping up before you get revenues and so forth and I guess I am wondering is the margin headwind from that bigger in \u201913 than it is in \u201912 and then does it sort of ramp down in \u201914. Am I thinking about that the right way or sort of medium term?","Tony Huegel","Well, we of course are going to get into a whole lot of guidance and as it relates to \u201913, clearly we have some of the IT four cost behind us as you look out at \u201913 but on the other hand we will have still the development costs going forward. But our expectation of course would be as you bring these factories online you are going to start generating revenues to cover some of these expenses and of course there are some expenses that are initial start up expenses that do go away but the aggregate picture of how that all fits together. I have to be perfectly honest with you I think we don't have a good view of that today.","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies & Co","Okay. Fair enough. I\u2019ll ask you again in a couple of quarter\u2019s maybe.","Tony Huegel","Some how that would be my expectations.","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies & Co","And maybe a little just a little bit of follow up in Europe, I am kind of struck by, thank you Jim for the color on the order book in Europe and clearly we\u2019ve seen some strong retail numbers over there recently for the past few months and the order book looks pretty good. So sort of the flat forecast there. I guess I am wondering are you hearing something from the marketing folks that just makes you nervous about the second half perhaps or is it more just we not sure what\u2019s happening and we want to be conservative?","Tony Huegel","Well, first of all the outlook is flat to up 5%, which is increased from the prior outlook. And with that keep in mind and Jim was talking to was our order book and as we mentioned earlier in the call first with the new products and our drive there in Europe for market share I think that\u2019s just reflecting some of those expectations in terms of our performance versus the overall market.","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies & Co","So you are not calling for a deceleration over there.","Tony Huegel","No not at all. As a matter of fact, if you look around the world I mean basically we\u2019ve got all the markets accelerating in South America and so and Europe is the same way.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy and please state your company name.","Robert McCarthy - Robert W. Baird","It\u2019s Robert W. Baird. I wanted to ask about your forecasting for the US and Canada Ag market in the contest of the discussion about crop received etcetera and a reversion to a more normal yield. But of course we have an ongoing precipitation issue particularly in the upper mid-west but also in southern plains you refer to West Texas cotton. How do you factor that into your forecast, do you just accept that you can\u2019t be a weather forecaster and so and by default at this point in year, you are going to assume normal yield or have you baked something specific into your forecast that could accommodate the pressure on yields because of low moisture condition that we are going to have?","Marie Ziegler","Rob, at this point the only weather impact that we put in the forecast is the shift down in some cotton acreage and a little bit of increase in corn as a result because of the draught situation that we have talked about Texas. But at this time our practice has been to go with the trend yields because there is a lot of variables yet in the weather that can affect that. So you are really looking at what we would consider to be trend yield.","Robert McCarthy - Robert W. Baird","Okay. I just want to make sure that I understood. And just a point of clarification, the answer may be obvious but as I look at your slide 13 that details your Ag and turf industry outlook by region, the first five of the six bullet points of the core agricultural business, would it be fair to say that in your plan you expect to outperform these industry growth numbers in each of those five regions?","Marie Ziegler","Absolutely.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich and please state your company name.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","","Can you say more about the factors that drove 16% lower production than you expect the outside US and Canada this quarter and I am looking slide 27, thanks.","Tony Huegel","","Yeah. Well, the first thing, of course, it\u2019s at 16% on a seasonally weak quarter for our European operations. And the other issue is we had some production shift that\u2019s reflected in the overall tonnage that we moved in to the second quarter, that\u2019s affecting some of that as well. But beyond that, Marie?","Marie Ziegler","","There would be a little bit of impact probably from combines out of South America, I think, as well documented. But if you look at the full year forecast for outside US and Canada, it\u2019s actually up a little bit.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs ","","And Jim, did you mentioned some of that as because of production shift in Europe. Can you say more about that point in to the second quarter?","Jim Field","","Well, it was just that as we got in to the schedule for the European operations, there were some units that were moved from late in the quarter to the following month.","Tony Huegel","","But it\u2019s just minor. It\u2019s really a minor timing changes within the production.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs ","","And your sales guidance in C&F implies a slower production increase in coming quarters than typical seasonality. Is there just room for upside or any specific drivers that you\u2019re looking at?","Marie Ziegler","","Again, that reflects IT 4 conversions and remember, you have to shut the line down. Then you convert and then you restart. So, you got some ramp up through there.","Jim Field","","And keep in mind, as compared to last year, in the first and second quarter, we had some increased production as we were moving to the SAP conversion that was right at the end of our second quarter and so it\u2019s really as much a 2011 shift in production as 2012.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Tiss. And please state your company name.","Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research","","Buckingham Research, how you doing? So just wondered if you can give us a sense of what is happening to the farmers break even cost on corn and on beans and I am just trying to gauge how much of an impact or potential drop in the crop prices in 2030 might have on volumes?","Jim Field","Sure and actually you know one thing I would cite is if you look, at there was the University of Illinois study that was done on last fall look at expected crop price, our input costs and so on and they looked at the 1200 acre farm and the metric they used is in terms of not so much break-even but making decent money. So at $50,000 net farm income, corn pricing they had on corn was about $3.70 and soy beans it will about $ 8.50 and that is very consistent what we would get from in Farm Economics, who is our outside consultant, they would say corn in the $3.50 to $3.70 range, farmers still make good money and the soy beans in the $7.50 to $8.00 range. So lot of headroom vis-\u00e0-vis where prices are today.","Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research","And is there a any number you can share with us on the earnings impact from the lower provision for credit losses in the quarter? Is that material?","Jim Field","It was in $4 million range.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Gupta and please state your company name.","Ashish Gupta - Credit Agricole Securities","Credit Agricole Securities. If we just step back for a second and focus on the long-term, your seven new factories are increasing production capacity at existing facilities. Can you just kind of give us an idea what you are most excited about in terms of incremental contributions over the multiple year period?","Jim Field","We are excited about several different aspects of it. What we said is near-term one of our largest growth opportunities would be kind of Europe from an SVA perspective; you know South America, we believe has plenty of headroom and we are seeing really pretty good activity starting to be restored in the CIS regions today. And the CIS is all about large Ag for us just in many respects very, very similar to the upper Midwest and generates margins that are very, very consistent with the types of margins that we see in the large Ag space in North America.","So, and then we've of course announced these factories in Asia. These are large unit volume markets; I think you\u2019re looking at something north of 500,000 industry volume in India this year, but of course much, much lower ticket per unit. So there are six geographies we\u2019re focused on around the world and each holds some very interesting and promising opportunities for us.","Ashish Gupta - Credit Agricole Securities","And then just a follow-up on the balance sheet quickly, I was trying to think about how much incremental cash you guys will have this year to buyback stock. Can you kind of review your balance sheet management and your debt maturity schedule versus your liquidity for 2012?","Susan Karlix","Well, our cash flow that we expect to generate from operations is about $3.5 billion. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that we do have some large debt maturities that\u2019s in one of the schedules in the appendix. Our cash management, we will be positioning ourselves with some amount of cash to make sure that we have a fairly smooth transition as we have to repay those; we\u2019ve got a very large maturity in the second and then another one in the third quarter. And quite candidly, we have been doing some prefunding you see that reflect in our cash balance and so, but I mean we expect to manage very comfortably through it and I\u2019ve already demonstrated by virtually the amount of cash that we will have a smooth transition.","Tony Huegel","We need to move on to the next caller please. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Weber and please state your company name.","Seth Weber - RBC","Sorry if I missed this, but the $100 million of additional cost that you absorbed in the quarter for start-up and overhead, I mean did you -- can we talk about how that\u2019s going to trend through the year or do you expect that to trend down quarterly as we go through the year or is that kind of a steady state for the next couple of quarters?","Jim Field","Well, right now the way we see it is that that would be a heavier headwind in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year. So yes, it does trend down in the second half of the year.","Seth Weber - RBC","And then just to follow-up on Latin America, I mean you guys have done a really nice job taking share there. Have you noticed any kind of competitive response with respect to pricing, as pricing got more aggressive across the industry or can you comment on any of that?","Jim Field","I wouldn\u2019t probably, it\u2019s not our practice really to get into talking too much about what\u2019s going on with the competition, but I would tell you that we have positive price realization in South America last year; we are forecasting positive price realization in South America this year and so, and we had it in the fourth quarter. So, obviously there is a lot of competitive dynamics around the globe, but for us, it\u2019s about getting market share and getting it in a sustainable way; and if it\u2019s through price, it\u2019s not sustainable. So I think the fact that we have gotten this price realization is good evidence that we are doing it the John Deere way and the right way and the sustainable way.","Tony Huegel","We will move onto the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Raso and please state your company name?","David Raso - ISI Group","","ISI, really just one quick question. The cost you said in the first quarter for Ag & Turf, if I add those back it implies an incremental margin of 33% and an operating margin of 14.3% and 33% incremental would be the strongest incremental in a couple of years. So I am just trying to get a feel for how you look at the underlying profitability of Ag & Turf?","As you look at the full year guidance, you are roughly implying still the same idea of about 15% Ag & Turf margin, may be a tad higher. I was just trying to get to the underlying business when these costs recede; so I am just trying to get my arms around ex those costs, you had a core incremental margin of 33% for the quarter; it just doesn\u2019t seem that logical given a tough comp against the Combine production a year ago?","Jim Field","Well, I think for starter, certainly if we talk about, the combines were lower in the quarter, but we did have some strength last year. Our large tractor, the 8000 series tractor was lower than normal as we went through conversion in January of last year. And there are other products that have very strong margins as well that we\u2019re seeing some strength in this year.","Unidentified Company Representative","","But, I think, you know, if you think about this from a macro-perspective, David, I think you, well we\u2019re thinking about it more right than wrong, you know, what we\u2019ve got here is the situation where we\u2019re investing a lot around the globe for the future growth of this company. We have these headwinds caused by regulatory requirements and despite all of that, we\u2019re putting up first quarter operating margins on an absolute basis; forget about the incrementals are about as good as we\u2019ve ever had. And so I think we\u2019re accomplishing what we wanted to accomplish with is invest in the growth, invest in what we need to do to bring out superb IT4 product and maintain very healthy levels of margins and we\u2019ve done that.","Operator","","Thank you. Our final question comes from Ann Duignan, and please state your company name.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Yeah, one of the questions we get a lot from investors is just there is a mix going forward. You know, you invest in the rest of the world and the North America, high horse power and Combine market may be mature. You know, the mix going forward maybe negative. Could you just talk about what\u2019s your expectations are for, you know the mix of products, maybe the mix of margin, I know, you won\u2019t get in to margin in any great detail but, you know any color you could give us in terms of what\u2019s your expectations are from a mix perspective as you expand doubly?","Jim Field","","Well, I think, I would start, first of all, as part of that global expansion, we also and then in our aspirations we talk about, an aspiration of growing our operating margin from, of roughly 10% at mid-cycle to 12%. So I think that\u2019s reflective of our expectations that mix aside that we\u2019ll continue to improve our operating margins as we move forward. And again if you look at mix you can also look at, yes we have growth in some regions where you might be heavily weighted towards smaller Ag\u2019s, but we also have some good growth opportunities in places in Russia and the CIS which will have a significant large Ag mix not to mention South America and our growth opportunities there. ","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","And just as a follow-up, on your outlook for Asia, Asia is a very large region and within that we have China and we also have Australia and New Zealand, can you talk about the fundamentals in both of regions versus the other?","Jim Field","In terms of Australia versus in Asia?","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Australia-New Zealand versus China, when you gave guidance, you just gave Asia which incorporates both?","Jim Field","Right; well primarily that our Asia guidance is primarily being driven by India and China and so we talk on the opening comments India in the tractor industry that\u2019s coming here we are looking at about relatively flat tractor industry after two very strong growth years and still at very high levels. And then certainly China continues to see some nice growth, in both cases, government is very supportive of the growth of agriculture. So with that, we thank you for your call.","Marie Ziegler","And may be I\u2019ll just summarize quickly. Thank you for joining us today as we talked about an excellent first quarter, excellent prospects for the remainder of the year and certainly we\u2019ve had the opportunity to talk about the some of the things we\u2019re doing to position ourselves to take advantage of the very exciting tailwinds we have globally. Susan, Tony, I and [Christian] will be available for your questions as we move through the day. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session of today's conference.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Josh Jepsen, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Josh Jepsen","Hello, good morning. Also on the call today are Ryan Campbell, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brent Norwood, Manager of Investor Communications.","Today, we\u2019ll take a closer look at Deere\u2019s first quarter earnings, then spend some time talking about our markets and current outlook for fiscal 2020. After that, we\u2019ll respond to your questions. Please note that slides are available to complement the call this morning and can be accessed at our website at johndeere.com\/earnings.","First, a reminder, this call is being broadcast live on the Internet and recorded for future transmission and use by Deere & Company.

Brent?","Brent Norwood","John Deere completed the first quarter with a solid performance and sees early signs of stabilization for the U.S. Ag industry. That's been improved as some progress was made addressing market access for U.S. farmers through the passage of USMCA, and the phase 1 trade agreement with China.","Meanwhile, markets such as Brazil got off to a slower start, even as underlying fundamentals and farm production remains high. At the same time, markets for our Construction and Forestry division slowed, dampening results as the division takes actions to manage inventory levels and adjust to lower levels of demand.","Now, let's take a closer look at our first quarter results beginning on Slide 3. Enterprise net sales and revenues were down 4% to about $7.6 billion, while net sales for our equipment operations were down 6% to about $6.5 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was up 4% to $517 million, or $1.63 per diluted share. The results included a pretax expense of $127 million relating to the voluntary employee separation program conducted during the quarter.","Moving on to review of our individual businesses, we will first start with agriculture and turf on Slide 4. Net sales were down 4% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, primarily driven by lower shipment volumes and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by positive price realization. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 3 points, while currency translation was negative by a point.","Operating profit was $373 million, resulting in an 8.3% operating margin for the division. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to positive price realization and lower production costs, partially offset by lower volume as well as a $78 million charge relating to the voluntary employee separation program.","Before reviewing our industry outlook, we'll first provide commentary on the regional dynamics impacting Ag markets and Deere operations around the globe. Starting on Slide 5, in the U.S. farmers' sentiment began to show early signs of stabilization during the quarter, as uncertainty surrounding market access abated with the passage of USMCA and the signing of the phase 1 trade agreement with China.","Additionally, U.S. farm cash receipts are expected to increase in 2020, aided in part, by the recently announced the third tranche of market facilitation payments, which totaled $3.6 billion, further enhancing farmer liquidity. While market access certainly has improved sentiment, farmers will likely remain cautious until Ag exports to China begin to flow. Given the seasonality for soybean demand, exports ports to China are unlikely to increase significantly until harvest season.","As a result, we do not expect significant changes in the replacement cycle during fiscal year 2020. Furthermore, at this point in the year, many of our large Ag products are already sold ahead, via early order programs that have now closed.","Despite limited changes to the current replacement cycle, we were encouraged by the results of the final two phases of our combine early order program. After a slow start, this stronger finish resulted in overall program orders ending up low-single digits in the U.S., while down double digits in Canada. In total, the program ended down a high single digit on a unit basis, but down just a low single digit on a revenue basis due to price increases.","Meanwhile, our tractor order book for fiscal year 2020 is healthy, with a strong sold ahead position indicating a positive reception to our newly redesigned 8R, featuring an industry first fully integrated four track option for a rigid frame row crop tractor.","The strong order book reflects in part, measures we took, during 2019 to manage field inventory, allowing us to produce in line with retail sales in 2020, which is currently still our plan. Moreover, the actions we took in 2019, resulted in desirable field inventory to sales ratios, that are significantly below the rest of the industry. And we'll continue to manage new equipment inventory tightly throughout the year. Meanwhile, large Ag used inventory levels are in their healthiest position in years, which is supportive of a stable price environment for used equipment.","In contrast to the U.S., our field inventories, though considerably lower than last year, remain elevated in Canada. This is due to challenging industry conditions, namely existing trade barriers on Canadian canola and a declining exchange rate. Net farm income is expected to increase this year, but will still be below long-term averages. As a result, we don't see much change on the equipment replacement cycle in 2020, and we will focus on continuing to reduce our field inventory, so that, we can more closely match production to retail sales in 2021.","Shifting to South America and Europe on Slide 6, record soybean production and favorable exchange rates continue to drive very favorable producer margins in Brazil this year. These healthy soybean dynamics, coupled with an improving outlook for sugar prices have improved overall fundamentals for the country in 2020.","Despite these sound fundamentals, farmers are somewhat cautious regarding equipment investment, as the impact of shifting trade dynamics have yet to be determined. Brazilian farmers were also anticipating further clarity and possibly better terms on government sponsored financing for farm equipment, which contributed to lower retail sales at the end of 2019 and lower shipments through the beginning of 2020.","On that note, in late January, the government announced a new financing program that will begin the transition to unsubsidized market base rates for Ag equipment. This development should provide greater clarity on funding options for farmers and potentially support stronger equipment sales, for the second half of the year. Meanwhile, sentiment in Argentina remained subdued as farmers adjust to higher export taxes on corn and soybeans. On a positive note, this year's crop is very strong, and margins are expected to be positive even in the face of higher taxes.","Moving on to Europe, even though, results, for winter crop conditions have been mixed, overall Ag fundamentals have mostly improved year-over-year, as the north region is recovering from last year's drought. Margins in dairy and livestock remained supportive, while wheat prices continue above breakeven levels. But, despite the modest improvement in fundamentals, sentiment does remain soft.","Concerning Deere's operations within Europe, we continue to drive greater degrees of optimization and focus to our business. Over the last few months, we've began work on rationalizing the operations of our sales branches and shifting more resources to our frontline selling efforts.","We are also concentrating our product portfolio towards large Ag, with a deeper focus on precision technologies. And we're accelerating the implementation, of our Dealer of Tomorrow strategy in the region, more closely, to what we have done in North America to ensure our channel is appropriately scaled and optimized in order to deliver and support higher degrees of technology in the coming years.","With that context, let's turn to our 2020, Ag and turf industry outlook on Slide 7. Unchanged from last quarter, we expect Ag industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 5% for 2020, reflecting a stable environment in the U.S. offset by more challenging conditions in Canada.","Moving on to Europe, the industry outlook is forecast to be flat in 2020, as most regions impacted from last year's drought are expected to recover, with favorable production for the year. Furthermore, the outlook for the dairy sector remains stable.","In South America, industry, sales of tractors and combines are projected to be flat for the year. Fundamentals in Brazil remain positive, as a result of high levels of grain production combined with healthy producer margins and restored liquidity in the financing market. However, other Latin American markets, like Mexico and to a greater extent Argentina, faced near-term challenges due to the potential for adverse policy impacting the Ag sector.","Shifting to Asia, industry sales are expected to be flat, with growth in India offset by slowness in China. Lastly, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat in 2020, based on stable general economic factors.","Moving on to our Ag and turf forecasts on Slide 8, fiscal year 2020 sales of worldwide Ag and turf equipment are still forecasted to be down between 5% to 10%, which includes expectations of 2 points of positive price realization and a currency headwind of about a point. It's important to note, that our sales forecast continues to contemplate producing below retail demand for small tractors in 2020.","For the division operating margin, our full year forecast is ranging between 10.5% and 11.5%, unchanged from last quarter. Additionally, when modeling the full year, keep in mind, that some of our large Ag production schedules include lower shipment volumes in the second quarter, due to factory changeovers resulting from the introduction of the new 8R Series tractor and a limited production build, of the new X series combines.","Now, let's focus on construction and forestry on Slide 9. For the quarter, net sales of about $2.044 billion were down 10% primarily due to lower shipment volumes and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by positive price realization. Operating profit moved lower year-over-year to $93 million, primarily due to lower shipment volumes as well as $24 million in expenses relating to the voluntary employee separation program. On the positive, price realization and currency benefited profit for the quarter.","Let's turn to our 2020 construction and forestry industry outlook on Slide 10. Construction equipment industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be down between 5% to 10%, reflecting mixed economic indicators and elevated levels of field inventory. For the year, employment, GDP and housing starts all remain stable drivers of demand, while oil and gas CapEx and rental CapEx are mostly down year-over-year.","Moving on to global forestry, we now expect the industry to decline 5% to 10% this year, with the U.S. and Canada markets declining more than the rest of the world, as lumber and pulp prices soften in North America.","Moving to the C&F outlook on Slide 11, Deere's construction and forestry 2020 sales are still forecast to be down between 10% to 15% compared to last year. The year-over-year decline is driven mostly by a mid-single digit under production to retail construction equipment volumes, compared to the building of inventory in 2019. The order book remains within our historical 30 to 60 day replenishment window, and is consistent with our outlook.","Our net sales guidance for the year, includes expectations of about 1 point of positive price realization and a currency headwind of about 1 point. For the division's operating margin, our full year forecast is ranging between 9.5% to 10.5%, unchanged from last quarter.","Let's move now to our financial services operations on Slide 12. Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $137 million in the first quarter. For fiscal year 2020, net income forecast remains $600 million, which contemplates a tax rate between 24% and 26%. The provision for credit losses in 2020 is forecast at 18 basis points, reflecting a high degree of credit quality within our current portfolio.","Slide 13, outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. Before reviewing the components of our guidance, it's worth noting that we are monitoring the coronavirus situation and working closely with the Chinese provincial authorities, primarily focused on the wellbeing of our employees and a safe return to production. In terms of overall exposure, the biggest potential impacted Deere is in relation to the supply base that serves our international operations. The situation remains fluid, and we're working closely with our suppliers and logistics providers.","Our full year outlook for net income remains unchanged and is forecast to be in a range of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion, with an effective tax rate projected to be between 22% to 24%. Cash flow from the equipment operations forecast is also unchanged and expected to be in a range of $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion in 2020. The guidance reflects a potential $300 million voluntary contribution to our OPEB plan.","I'll now turn the call over to Ryan Campbell, for closing comments. Ryan?","Ryan Campbell","Before we respond to your questions, I'd first like to offer some thoughts on current market conditions in Ag, and revisit some of the key initiatives we have underway in 2020.","After a year of uncertainty in 2019, we're encouraged by early signs of stabilization evident in the beginning of 2020. We view the signing of the phase 1 trade agreement with China and the passage of USMCA as important first steps for removing some of the uncertainty that has weighed on producer sentiment over the last year.","Continued positive sentiment will be dependent in part, upon a pickup and U.S. exports of agricultural goods to China. Over the last quarter, we were pleased with the conclusion of our combine early order program and the progress made, on our large tractor order book. As Brent noted, orders for our combine program ended up in the U.S.","We are finding that despite, periods of high uncertainty, customers continue to invest in products and services that drive economic value. Customers are increasingly opting for solutions that offer the highest levels of productivity, driving a better outcome for their operations, and higher average selling prices for us. We view this as evidence, that we can drive growth and our financial results even in periods, when the number of units we sell is flat to slightly down.","Now, shifting our focus to 2020 and beyond, recently discussed, some key initiatives to help us better execute our strategy. During our CES Analyst Day, John May, laid out his priorities as CEO. Our first priority is to refocus our capital allocation on investments that one, intensify our precision Ag leadership. Two, expand our aftermarket and retrofit business. And three, increase our emphasis on products and markets that have the greatest opportunity for differentiation.","Our second priority involves reorienting our cost structure, including both our organizational design and footprint to create a more agile company, to best capitalize on the significant opportunity in front of us. To that end, we conducted a voluntary separation program during the first quarter, as a step towards achieving greater degrees of agility.","Over the course of the year, we\u2019ll pursue additional opportunities pertaining to our overseas footprint and organizational design. We believe the resulting organization will be more efficient and better equipped, to respond to dynamic market conditions. As we have indicated, we will provide updates on these initiatives during our quarterly earnings calls, as decisions are made.","Brent Norwood","Now, we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. In consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Caroline?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Yes. Hi, good morning everyone. Ryan, I'm wondering if you could just expand on your last comment in terms of organizational structure and the opportunity set from realignment. Correct me if I'm wrong. I think you folks are set up as a matrix organizational structure with very heavy emphasis on shared services. And so when we've seen these transitions in the past, towards direct regional responsibility, there has been really significant benefit at the margin line pretty quickly. So how should we think about your transition here as an organization compared to what we've seen from others that have had similar transition from matrix to regional responsibilities that you outlined here?","Ryan Campbell","Yes, Jerry, thanks for that question. We're still going through the analysis of what it might look like. And what I would point to is, now when we talked to CES and we talked about our bridge from mid-cycle margins from 12.5% to 15%, we said about 1% would come from cost structure. Certainly, the voluntary separation program that we just executed is a component of that, the Wirtgen synergies is a component of that.","And then the footprint and kind of the recharacterization of the organizational design will be the rest of that. And so if you think about 1 point would be over $300 million, we took about - we\u2019ll get about $120 million in savings from the voluntary separations programs, we did in 2019 and 2020. The Wirtgen synergy is \u20ac125 million, you get about a similar amount for the rest of it.","So, we're early at, we'll talk as we make those decisions, but that\u2019s how we would characterize it at this point.","Jerry Revich","And Ryan, the ultimate opportunity set, could it be bigger than that? I guess, when we've seen these changes in the past, we've seen something closer 200 basis points to 300 basis points of margin improvement. Is that what your benchmarking shows, or is it too soon to talk about numbers of that size until we're further along?","Ryan Campbell","I would say, too soon to talk about that. We'd still point you to the numbers that we talked about to get us to 15%. As we get through it, we'll certainly provide updates on our quarterly calls.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Joe O'Dea","Hi, good morning everyone. You touched on seasonality of China purchasing of U.S. Ag commodities, but as we think about getting into the fall and post the phase 1 agreement. How are you thinking about that level of activity, whether that should return to a pre-trade dispute type of purchasing, whether it'll be stronger than just based on your evaluation of the phase 1 agreement?","Ryan Campbell","Joe, thanks for the question. I think, it's certainly still early. I think, as Brent alluded to, we're at a period of time, where typically now you see the purchases moved to South America, coming back to North America kind of post our harvest time. So, we think there is some time like there.","I think the real question is, as we think about how do we get to a larger number of purchases, and some of the numbers that have out there are roughly 2 times what we've done kind of historically on historical averages. So, I think it's still early to determine exactly what that looks and also what commodities make that up, play a pretty big role, is it a continued purchases of soybeans or do we see other commodities things like pork, ethanol and others come into the trade that necessarily haven't always been there haven't been significant.","So, I think a lot of questions still there, in terms of how that comes through, as well as in the near-term with coronavirus and some of the things that have slowed, just overall activity in China, what impact does that have on their ability to make those purchases.","Joe O'Dea","Got it. Thank you.","Ryan Campbell","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stephen Volkmann","Hi, good morning, everybody. I wanted to dig in a little bit to your view of the Ag margins. Obviously, they came in quite a bit better than I think, some of us expected here in the first quarter. And frankly, it's a little tough to kind of hold them down into the level you've given in terms of guidance for the full year. When we think about the tailwind from the headcount reduction savings and probably some kind of mix improvement, I would assume, and maybe a little bit more production to retail versus last year.","Are there some headwinds that we should be thinking about that kind of offset some of those benefits? Or is that maybe somewhat of a conservative outlook or are we skewing toward the higher end of the margin range or something, just a little more color on how you're thinking about that?","Ryan Campbell","Yes, Steve, I mean, you're right. First of all, I think that we were pleased with the way the first quarter came in, margins up on lower sales, I think that's a positive. As we think about the full year, I think a few things that we are contemplating. One, it is still early. We're watching the situation in China with coronavirus closely, as well as in Brazil, where, as we've noted, we've started the year with a little bit slower retail activity. Our view there's that picks up, it's more back-half loaded, but that's something we'll watch pretty closely.","One other thing, as we think about first quarter versus the rest of the year, the first quarter we had a nearly 3 points of price realization. Our full year is about 2 points, so, not as much expected there from that perspective. So, overall, not a change in our range, and we think, there's still a lot of moving pieces, so we feel like that's prudent.","Maybe one thing to call out in particular, as we think about the second quarter, and Brent alluded to in his comments, is our second quarter, we have a few, I'd say, maybe unusual seasonal impacts in the quarter. One, we see much lower cotton sales in 2Q of this year, because they came through the first quarter, so that's really just timing of production. But also, we have a new product transition in Waterloo, for our brand new 8R tractor, as well as limited production builds for our new combine. And the result of those two things, will certainly impact what we're able to produce and ship during the month.","And then one last thing to think about in 2Q is, as we think about coronavirus, and some of those impacts, one of the things that we've thought about is the impact on our supply base there, and the ability to get parts to our operations internationally. So, we've actually, in our second quarter included about $40 million of cost of expedited freight to make sure that we're able to have that availability to get parts into the operations. So that, all of those things result in, probably a lighter topline and margin line for 2Q than what we seasonally would see.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. So Ryan, maybe overall just to summarize, we certainly feel good about the performance in the first quarter. But, there's a few moving pieces for the rest of the year, and it's too early for us to change our range at this point.","Stephen Volkmann","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Thein from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Tim Thein","Thank you. And first, Josh, thanks for the added disclosures in these lines. But just to continue along that that train of thought, in terms of the second quarter, obviously, historically, the highest seasonal quarter from a margin perspective. The factors you just outlined are those enough to - does that change this year such that third quarter you think is higher than the second from a margin perspective? Or, I again, recognize you don't give quarterly margin guidance, but just to make sure we understand kind of the magnitude of those impacts.","Ryan Campbell","Yes, I'd say more similar now between those two than the difference that we've seen in the past.","Tim Thein","So, okay, 2Q, 3Q kind of posted on par with one another's?","Ryan Campbell","Correct, yes.","Tim Thein","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. Just following on to Steve's question on the Ag margins, again, I agree with his thoughts that the guide seems conservative. You did also talk about some of the actions you're taking in Europe within Ags. So, I'm wondering if there's any costs associated with that or how much that sort of incrementally if any weighing on the Ag margins relative to how I think about margins in South America or there U.S. for Ag? So, that's my first question.","And I guess my second question on the flip side, the construction margins were a little weaker than I would have expected, understanding, you kept your margins the same, but just sort of your confidence level there, if there was anything in particular that weighed on the construction margins in the first quarter. Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","So on the Ag side, starting the Ag side, I mean, I think as we think about Europe, some of the things we've already done, we executed on in 4Q of '19 and in 1Q, so, as we stand today, with where we're at, nothing additional to call out. If we do further actions, as Ryan mentioned, we'll lay those out and talk through those, but nothing major contemplated right now.","As you think about construction and construction in the quarter, we had lower margins, the voluntary separation expenses $24 million, have an impact, and then lower volume, unfavorable mix, and then just the under production component are really the biggest drivers of that lower margin in the quarter.","Maybe just a context and as we think about the full year, and what do we see there, we do expect to see mix improve as we go through the year, as we expect, our construction North American construction equipment mix will improve as we under produce less throughout the balance of the year. In addition to that, road building, which is more seasonally skewed, is a bigger portion of our total C&F business this year, and is much more heavily weighted their seasonality to 2Q and 3Q in the year.","So, I think those are probably the biggest drivers on the construction side from a margin perspective.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Ashish Gupta from Stephens. Your line is open.","Ashish Gupta","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Appreciated the color on the supply chain impact and the costs you guys are budgeting for the second quarter. Just wondering if you can maybe expand on, and I think you said that the component you make in China for other international markets, I'm just wondering if there's any supply chain type impacts that could come over time with the virus spreading to Japan and South Korea.","Josh Jepsen","Yes, so when we think about kind of the impacts and potential impacts of the coronavirus is kind of two components like that we mentioned. One is direct exposure, our sales into the China market that's relatively small for our Ag and turf business and for our traditional C&F business. Road building, though, has a bigger exposure there. So road building in China will tend to be 10% to 15% of their overall sales. So more of an impact there.","We did see some reduction in their topline as a result of the lack of activity in that market over the last month or so. So we have seen some of that impact. That's one.","The second component is on supply chain. And we've got suppliers in China that supply our operations across the globe. So, those are the suppliers we're watching closely, we're working through our supply management teams working really diligently to understand where each of those are, and the process to either, are they producing or when are they going to begin to produce, so that's something we're watching and monitoring closely.","As a result of that, as I mentioned, that's where we did go ahead and set up and get capacity to expedite freight to make sure we can try to get those parts to our facilities during the quarter.","Ashish Gupta","But if we remain in sort of an extended shut down or you see impact from quarantining in South Korea or Japan, do you see any impact there? And I guess, I should ask also, do you have other component suppliers that you can leverage in other regions in the Europe or U.S.?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. I mean, first, I'd say it's really fluid and very early. This is day-to-day shifting in terms of what's going on. So, as we move forward, we will certainly update, but that\u2019s kind of what we know today. And as always, our supply management teams are always looking at opportunities to resource and leverage suppliers that have multiple locations. So we're working through all those potential opportunities. Thanks Ashish, we will go ahead and go to our next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Andy Casey","Thanks. Good morning everybody. A question on cash flow, I mean, you had a really good first quarter in terms of cutting the outflow relative to last year on the operating cash line. You didn\u2019t really change the full year guidance. So, I'm wondering, what do you expect for the balance of the year in terms of working capital? And then, b, you didn\u2019t really keep pace with the share repo and I'm wondering if that\u2019s a signal that you are going to keep it dampened for the balance of the year or will that reaccelerate?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. From a cash flow perspective we maintain the range, we're focused on managing inventory and receivables. We saw really good progress as you noted in the first quarter. But I think overall, I'd say, it's early in the year. We didn\u2019t adjust our topline ranges nor our net income range. Felt it was prudent given just three months in that we maintain that from a cash flow perspective.","Ryan Campbell","And Andy, it's Ryan. We took inventory out throughout the balance of '19, so that inventory reduction evens out over time, significant in the first quarter, but it evens out, although we do still project an inventory reduction.","With respect to the buyback, we did around $100 million for the first quarter, that\u2019s in line with our historical average. Typically, first quarter is a use of cash for us as we build some working capital. So nothing to read into that. It's right in line with what we've done historically, in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question or comment is from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Raso","Hi, thank you. I'm just trying to do a margin walk for Ag and turf for the year. If we just think the rest of the year, the price cost, what are you baking in for the year on price cost for Ag or the next nine months?","Josh Jepsen","It would be favorable.","Ryan Campbell","And you know as Josh said, we did about 3 in price. The first quarter full year is 2. So, there is an impact of that going through the rest of the year. So price cost still favorable but less favorable than the first quarter.","David Raso","Well, I'm just trying to figure price cost was 1.97 positive for the first quarter when you add the price change and the production cost change. The rest of the year implied pricing is another $340 million or so. Do you think your cost go back up? Because I'm just trying to get the walk here from you are implying something about the decrementals on the volume declines for the rest of the year. But the savings from the separation cost within this division in the next nine months roughly should offset the incremental freight in the second quarter. Is that the right way to think about those two moving parts, separation savings versus the $40 million freight cost from coronavirus in 2Q?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. Well, I think it's maybe a little more - there is a little more than trying to just compare one or two components. I mean, overall, as Ryan said, 2 points of price for the full year. Material and freight are favorable for us in 2020 and that includes the additional -","David Raso","$40 million.","Josh Jepsen","The additional $40 million, so still favorable. We do have a couple things that would be going against us there. Incentive comp is higher in the year, pension costs and OPEB costs are higher in the year. So there are some moving pieces there that impacts the overall net-net there.","David Raso","And related to that same question, that the underproduction for the year in Ag and turf, has that changed at all from three months ago, be it high horsepower versus low horsepower, magnitude? Any color there would be appreciated. Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. No change in terms of the expectations of how we produce relative to retail, or year-over-year.","Ryan Campbell","Yes. So large Ag, still roughly in line, small Ag underproduction.","David Raso","All right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is open.","Mig Dobre","Thank you. Good morning. Going back to construction, can you maybe help us understand sort of what's baked into your guidance in terms of earthmoving versus road building? And I'm kind of curious here as you think about your earthmoving business, do you think about the second quarter and beyond? At what point in time do you think you're going to be in a position where you can produce a little closer to retail demand? Is this maybe late in 2020 or more of a 2021 thing?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. Thanks Mig. I think when we think about construction and forestry and if we look at kind of North American construction equipment, which I think is where your question really lies, is, for the balance of the year we will under produce retail demand. It's more front-half loaded. Certainly, the first quarter, we under produced more significantly than we will the balance of the year.","So, as I mentioned a little bit talking about mix in that business improving over the year, that's a result of less underproduction of that CE that - North American construction equipment during the remaining quarters of the year.","Mig Dobre","And is road building down more or less than the segment average guidance?","Josh Jepsen","Less.","Mig Dobre","Can you quantify that?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. I mean, it's 5% or less.","Mig Dobre","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question or comment is from Chad Dillard from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Chad Dillard","Hi, good morning, guys. So I just want to go back to the question of small Ag and just want to understand, where did retail sales end up versus your expectations in the first quarter. And same question on the underproduction? Where did that end up versus your initial expectations? And how are you thinking about when you'll be able to produce in line with retail? Is it later in 2020? Or are we thinking about a little bit longer?","And secondly, just want to get some comments on how you're seeing the new 8R adoption unfold. Any indication on penetration uptake from the farmers?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. So, as it relates to small tractors in North America, and it's probably easiest or best to look at this on the full year given seasonality. We are, as Ryan mentioned, we expect to under produce retail demand in 2020 on contractors and that hasn't changed around 15% for the year. So that's the plan that we're executing to. And we think that puts us in a really solid position from an inventory to sales perspective when we end the year.","Ryan Campbell","Yes, so we would project 2021, we're producing in line with retail in that business.","Josh Jepsen","As it relates overall, the new 8R, we've seen good order activity there. We are ordered out further than we were a year ago. That's a little bit misleading just in that - we're impacted by the transition time as we moved - changed the factory over to begin producing the new model. But I think we've seen really positive response the 8R, in particular, the new four track option has been particularly well received and lots of interest and activity there for what that machine delivers. So, feel good about that.","Chad Dillard","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Ann Duignan from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning. If we could switch back to the fundamentals, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the strength of the real versus the dollar, I mean it's up 40% year-to-date. And what you think that might do to U.S. exports as we go forward? And couple that with the Argentinian peso and maybe the - and Ukraine on the corn side and versus the Brazil real on the bean side. What are your thoughts in terms of FX and strong dollar and the impact it has on competitiveness of U.S. agriculture?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. So, I think certainly, we've seen deterioration particularly in South America and the real and peso, what has been going on there. So that does impact competitiveness, particularly in the short-term. It also benefits profitability for those producers in those markets as well. So, there's puts and takes on both of those. I mean, I think importantly, as we think about this, from our perspective is, where are - the fact that we continue to see demand growing, consumption of grains growing, and there are only a few places that produce these grains, particularly soybeans, en masse, at scale, and in that relatively low cost of production.","So, we think, those places are the U.S., Brazil and Argentina to a lesser extent. So, again we think there's going to be the need for those grains, because those are really the only places that they're coming from. So, certainly, timing wise there can be advantages won or lost, as FX moves. But I think big picture when we step back feel like the demand for grain and the fact that these are only grown in a few places, at scale is an important thing to recall.","Ann Duignan","And along those lines just on Brazil again, why wouldn't farmers be spending money now than if they - if favorable financing is going to disappear midyear?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. So, I mean, I think, well, we talked about a little bit, I think the some of the caution there has been around trade. And you see a significant shift in China's purchase pattern. I think that's paused the market a little bit. And I think we saw this over particularly at the end of last year and into this year, a little bit of the concern on financing. I think one other things we've seen as the government came out and talked about Finame, as we go forward, I think that's helped eliminate some of the big concern as we've now talking about our program that begins the transition to less subsidization or less interest rate equalization as referred to in the market, and getting to more of a free market system.","And I think, a couple things that support that, one is we've seen pretty low interest rates, the benchmark rate in Brazil is at very low levels, which has been positive. So that certainly helps.","And our largest customers in Brazil for quite some time, have had access to bank, private bank financing. So, we actually believe the longer-term as we begin this transition that this will create more stability in the market, and less volatility in the Ag machinery sector, because it will be more driven by actual demand and not finance availability or alike.","As it relates, maybe one other note on Brazil, the lots of folks look at the shipment numbers coming out of Brazil, in Anfavea, and as earlier noted, someone made the comment we've seen weakness, as you noted, why are we seeing more activity.","One thing that we have seen as we've looked at that market, and you look at by horsepower, splits or segments, there's been a pretty big distinction. It's really been occurring over the last three years, where we're seeing high horsepower, and in their reporting that's above 130 horsepower has been growing, whereas, you've seen lower horsepower has been declining year-on-year. And even year-to-date, we're seeing the lower horsepower ranges down double-digits, while we're up on the high horsepower side.","So, there are a few dynamics there, but certainly, the growth in high horsepower and technology, we see a very positive, over the last few years that certainly helped to drive the market share gains we've seen and we think that continuing trend helps us, and particularly as you start to deliver more and more precision Ag into the market.","So, long answer, but I think that\u2019s some of how we're viewing the Brazilian market. We'll go ahead and jump to our next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Seth Weber from RBC. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is Brendan on for Seth. I'd like to touch on the higher losses on the lower residuals, you called this out last quarter as well. So I'd like to get, ask if you think that you've lowered them to a sufficient enough level where it kind of be less of a headwind going forward. And then if you could talk to whether the lower residuals you were saying, was that on your Ag equipment, your construction equipment or both?","Josh Jepsen","Thanks, Brendan. So, we noted losses in GDF in the quarter on operating leases, year-over-year, just first context as a little bit under $10 million, just to size that in terms of what we saw. Primarily those losses came in through our C&F division, really as of result of two things. A little bit of pressure on the overall used environment in C&F with higher inventories that have put some downward pressure on prices. And then we did take some actions during the quarter to move aged inventory and had relatively significant reductions of our matured lease inventory there that was of an older vintage. So, I think those are the things we saw there.","From an Ag and turf perspective, portfolio was pretty stable where recoveries, we didn't see much change and return rates actually improved a little bit for us in the quarter. So, we're really early on now, as we start to think about the changes, we made a quarter ago but very, very focused on working with our dealers through the process of retaining more of those lease maturities, programs in place to incentivize both the dealers and customers to engage in managing that inventory at a much higher level.","With that, we'll go ahead and go to our next question.","Operator","Our next question or comment is from Joel Tiss from BMO. Your line is open.","Joel Tiss","Hey guys, how's it going?","Josh Jepsen","Hey Joe.","Joel Tiss","I just wonder, maybe I'll glue two quick ones together. How far can farmers go before they start replacing their equipment? Like, do you have any history on what the longest kind of drought of buying has been? And then on the focus side, are you contemplating exiting whole geographies like bigger chunks? Or is this just more like tweaking and looking a little more granularly? Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. Maybe start with your second question. I mean, I think when we think about there, I'd say it's much more focused in terms of products and markets, how can we best serve those customers how we do that and in an efficient way, while also delivering the customer experience that they expect and deserve in that that we want to deliver.","So, I think it's more targeted than saying entire geography or product form, but being thoughtful in terms of how can we best serve those customers.","Ryan Campbell","Yes. Maybe it's a little more on how we go to market as opposed to which markets, we're going into.","Joel Tiss","Okay.","Josh Jepsen","And as it pertains to the age of fleet or how long can someone go until you see purchases, we're in the U.S. in particular, we think about aging fleet. We are now pushing past kind of what has been the historically equilibrium going back to say 2000. So we're on high horsepower on tractors and on combines and we're pushing beyond the point that we've kind of ran at through really the early 2000s. So, we think we're there in terms of the drivers replacement demand and on top of that technology and productivity to see more of that activity.","I think the uncertainty we've been dealt with over the last 18 months has caused a lot of that. But I think talking to dealers, talking to our team, I mean, certainly there's appetite and interest there. And when we can deliver not only productivity, but cost reduction, when we think about overall P&L for a farmer, there's value there.","Canada, maybe a little bit different situation, where we see the age of that fleet is a little younger. And as a result, and Brent alluded to this in his comments, maybe a little bit further out to some of the replacements. Just given that market did not cycle us as much down or up that we saw in the U.S.","Thanks, Joel. We'll go ahead and go to our next question.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Courtney Yakavonis","Thanks for the question. Maybe first, if you guys can just talk about the pricing expectations. I think pricing was a little bit better than we expect in the first quarter. And you did raise it for the year but still implying that pricing little bit worse. So maybe, can you just talk about where you saw the strength this quarter and why it should decelerate an Ag for the remainder of the year?","And then secondly, kind of on the back of the last question. I think when you talked about North America large Ag, the industry outlook staying at down 5%. It definitely sounds like U.S. is a little bit better than you originally expecting and Canada's a little bit worse. So, when you have been talking about no change in the equipment replacement schedule, maybe first I just wanted to make sure that was saying that the pause that you thought happened last year is going to continue into 2020. And then I think you've historically talked about commodity prices. And what level you think commodity prices will impact the replacement schedule? And if you can just kind of give us some type of framework for where commodity prices need to go before you start to see that replacements schedule to pick up again? Thanks.","Josh Jepsen","So, I think, as you think about the down 5% on large Ag in North America, you're exactly right in that. We see probably a little bit of improvement on the U.S. side and weaker on the Canada side. So that\u2019s a very fair. We talked - Brent talked a little bit about what we saw U.S. versus Canada on combines. We see kind of a similar impact as we look at large tractors from an order book perspective. So that kind of the dynamic that we've seen there.","As you think about price and how we came into the quarter, for C&F, we expect a point, we got about a point in the first quarter and we expect that for the year. On the Ag side, a little bit stronger price in the first quarter than our full year. We actually saw some improvement in overseas markets. So, that was, and the margins helped us a little bit, pushed us a little bit above what we had expected, I mean, into the quarter.","Courtney Yakavonis","And then lastly, on the commodity prices and impact on replacement.","Josh Jepsen","So, I mean, I think the easing of trade tensions and opening up of market access, we think is really important as the first step. I think, importantly, I think folks want to see grain actually flowing, grain actually moving purchases occurring. And we think that\u2019s particularly important. I mean, as you think about absolute prices we've felt - believe that in the range of $3.50 corn and $9 soybeans can drive replacement demand that\u2019s supportive of replacement demand.","So, I think, if we actually start to see grain move, I think that provides a little more confidence in terms of the access actually being there. And we think is supportive of replacement demand. So we'll go ahead and go to our next question. Thanks, Courtney.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ross Gilardi","Thanks for squeezing me in guys. I got cut off for a couple of minutes. So hopefully, nobody already asked this. But could you clarify what the year-on-year swing in dealer inventories was in Ag and turf just reason being if you look at your retail sales, it's hard to tell what the number is in totality, but it looks like it's down more than the 4% revenue decline you had in the quarters. Any color there I would appreciate it. I'm just trying to get at whether or not dealer, restocking contributing meaningfully to be maybe less than expected revenue decline in Q1?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. I think when we look at it, inventory to sales, in particular, if we look at kind of 100 horsepower and above, year-over-year it came down from 38% to 31% and combines we saw come down as well. I think overall from a small tractor perspective, we're relatively in-line with the industry and maybe down a little bit from where we were a year ago. But I think overall, we've continued to feel good about where we are from a large Ag perspective and the plans to execute for small tractors.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks. So I think we\u2019ve time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Thanks for taking the follow-up. I'm wondering if you could talk about the margin improvement plans for C&F specifically. So, a lot of what we've spoken about precision Ag and their pricing, is really focused on the Ag part of the equitation. I'm wondering if you could just have a little bit of a discussion on the opportunities for the C&F side beyond the Wirtgen synergies to get closer to that 15% corporate target?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. Thanks, Jerry. I mean, I think you know, maybe at a high level when we think about 15%, that is the margin level we expect to deliver. Our businesses may not all be exactly that number, but all contributing to getting there is probably an important distinction. But as we think about our construction business, and in particularly as we add in road building, which we feel like has a strong margin profile as well gives us an opportunity.","I think, from a technology perspective, we do see opportunities to be able to leverage some of the things that we've done on our Ag business into our construction business. So, we think there is opportunity to add and create value there for customers, which is an important component that\u2019s further out. But we think there's opportunity there. I'd say, today, very, very focused on managing the business, managing inventory, integrating Wirtgen and delivering on those synergies that that would be the near-term focus areas.","Jerry Revich","Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. And maybe the one last thing that we talked about at our Analysts Day at CES is the aftermarket opportunity in retrofit, and I think in particularly in construction, the ability to take care of that product over the lifecycle from a parts and service perspective, leveraging telematics and those sort of things that we have today, we think can deliver margin opportunity for all of our businesses as we go forward.","Jerry Revich","Thanks.","Josh Jepsen","Well, that concludes our call.

Also on the call today are Raj Kalathur, our Chief Financial Officer; Max Guinn, President of the Construction and Forestry Division; Ryan Campbell, Vice President and Comptroller; and Brent Norwood, Manager, Investor Communications.","Today, we\u2019ll take a closer look at Deere\u2019s second quarter earnings, then spend some time talking about our markets, and our current outlook for fiscal 2018. After that, we\u2019ll respond to your questions. Please note that slides are available to complement the call this morning. They can be accessed on our website at www.johndeere.com\/earnings.","First, a reminder.

It was another strong performance, helped by a broad-based improvement in market conditions and a favorable customer response to our innovative products. Farm machinery sales are making solid gains in markets throughout the world while construction equipment sales continue to move sharply higher.","Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at our second quarter results in detail, beginning on slide three. Net sales and revenues were up 29% to $10.72 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $1.208 billion or $3.67 per share. The results for the quarter included a favorable net adjustment to provisional income taxes of $174 million. Excluding this item, adjusted net income was $1.034 billion.","On slide four, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 34% to $9.747 billion. Currency translation was positive by 3 points; the impact of acquisitions was 12 points.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, starting with agriculture and turf on slide five. Net sales were up 22% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, primarily driven by higher shipment volumes and the favorable effect of currency translation. Operating profit was $1.056 billion, up 27% from the same quarter last year, excluding the impact from the sale of SiteOne. Operating margins for the quarter were 15%. Results benefited from higher shipment volumes, partially offset by higher R&D as well as increases in production costs, comprised largely of higher freight and material costs. It\u2019s also important to note that over the quarter, Deere has made progress addressing supplier and logistics challenges ensuring that our products reach customers in a timely manner.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let\u2019s look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. On slide six, corn and soybean stocks-to-use ratios are expected to decline in response to increasing global demand and drought conditions in Argentina, which have lowered the country\u2019s corn and soybean production by roughly 25% and 33%, respectively. While wheat stocks-to-use ratio remains close to its highest level in almost two decades, stocks are projected to decline modestly in 2018.","Slide seven outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. 2018 farm cash receipts are estimated to be $375 billion, roughly flat with 2017. Crop cash receipts are projected to be on-par with last year as increased commodity prices are partially offset by lower forecast production. Receipts from livestock are also flat due to strong domestic and export demand offset to an extent by growing supply and lower prices. While global trade concerns weigh on farmers, overall sentiment is holding as commodity prices move upward and equipment demand shows broad-based improvement.","Our ag economic outlook for the EU 28 is on slide eight. Despite a late start to the season, crops are in fair condition and the crop value of production is expected to increase in 2018. Overall, arable farm margins remain slightly below long-term averages, although conditions differ by region in some areas such as Northwest Europe are showing signs of improvement in 2018. Margins for the dairy segment remain above long-term averages though rising production may pressure prices later in the year.","Shifting to Brazil on slide nine. The chart on the left displays the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agro business in Brazil. The value of ag production is now expected to be about the same as last year with a record soybean harvest being partially offset by soft sugar prices. On the right side of the slide, you will see eligible rates for ag-related government sponsored finance programs. Rates for Moderfrota through June are shown below and are less favorable than the prevailing policy interest rate for the region. However, customers are anticipating lower rates in July and therefore shifting purchases into the second half of the year. This shift in sales is evident in a strong order book, which is up from last year. While the 2017 2018 season began with soft industry fundamentals, farmer confidence has increased dramatically for the second half of the season as corn and soybean margins have benefited from rising commodity prices, record production, and favorable FX movements.","Our 2018 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on slide 10. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be up approximately 10% for the year. Replacement demand continued to drive sales as customer sight the need for increased productivity, updated technology and equipment within its warranty period. Replacement demand is reflected in the results of our 2018 Combine Early Order program, which increased by double digits from previous year. Similarly, our large tractor order book now extends into October. The EU 28 industry outlook is forecast to be up about 5% in 2018, unchanged from previous guidance.","In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be flat to up 5% for the year. This is primarily driven by strong industry fundamentals in Brazil, which is offsetting weakness in Argentina caused by drought conditions experienced in the first half of the year. The region as a whole continues to deliver excellent operating results as Deere extends its market-leading position and achieves strong financial performance.","Shifting to Asia, industry sales are expected to be relatively unchanged from 2017, though strong demand for tractors in India is driving improved results for the region. Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2018.","Putting this all together on slide 11. Fiscal year 2018, Deere sales of worldwide ag and turf equipment are now forecast to be up about 14%, including about one point of positive currency translation. The ag and turf division\u2019s operating margin is forecast to be about 12.5% for the year, up roughly 2 points from 2017, after excluding the gains on the sale of SiteOne. Importantly, the impact of higher freight and material costs is being addressed through continued structural cost reductions and future pricing actions.","Now, let\u2019s focus on construction and forestry on slide 12. Net sales for the quarter were up 84% compared with last year, driven by strong demand for construction and forestry equipment, as well as by the acquisition of Wirtgen, which closed on December 1 of 2017. Second quarter operating profit was $259 million, benefiting from higher shipment volumes, as well as the inclusion of Wirtgen. However, Wirtgen\u2019s overall profit contribution has been limited due to the unfavorable effects of first-year purchase accounting associated with the transaction. C&F operating margins were 9.6% for the quarter, but 12% excluding Wirtgen.","At this point, I would like to welcome Max Guinn, President of Deere\u2019s Construction and Forestry business to the call. He will provide comments on the conditions in C&F and an update on the Wirtgen acquisition. Max?","Max Guinn","Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everybody. We\u2019re on slide 13.","Let me start off by saying the economic environment for the construction, forestry and road-building industries looks good. It continues to support increased demand for new and used equipment. For the year, U.S. GDP is forecast to grow at 2.7%, that\u2019s above the 20-year average. Meanwhile, housing demand remains solidly with housing starts expected to be 1.3 million units for 2018; that\u2019s a result of inventories of new and existing homes that are available-for-sale being at 36-year lows that provides a foundation for continued growth in new home construction.","In 2018, construction investment is forecast to grow 2.9% led by increased activity in oil and gas, and by residential construction. Oil prices, we had forecast to be $63 a barrel for the year; that\u2019s a price that\u2019s comfortably above breakeven economics for U.S. shale oil producers and it supports continued drilling and production growth. Obviously, prices have progressed further and faster than we expected. So, we\u2019re likely going to update that forecast. That\u2019s good news though.","In addition, machinery rental utilization rates continue improving and rental pricing is gaining positive traction. These positive economic factors are also reflected in a strong order book and resulting in significant orders that are already being placed for 2019.","Let\u2019s move to slide 14 and an update on the newly acquired Wirtgen Group. Wirtgen is the global leader in road construction equipment. The acquisition greatly enhances Deere\u2019s exposure to global transportation infrastructure; that\u2019s a segment we view as faster growing and less cyclical than the broader construction market. Global transportation investment this year is forecast to grow 6%, driving increased demand for road construction equipment such as milling machines, rollers and asphalt pavers. Those are all products in which Wirtgen maintains a market-leading position, globally. Importantly, transportation spending is solid in core regions such as the U.S. and Europe, and continues to see double-digit growth in China and India. Both of those are key growth markets for Wirtgen due to a market-leading position.","Turning to company performance. Wirtgen continues to meet our high expectations through its relentless focus on market share and operating excellence. The current order book is very strong, operating margins are expected to exceed 16% when excluding the impact of purchase accounting. Integration is well underway with the joint Deere-Wirtgen team working towards the synergy target of \u20ac100 million by 2022. I\u2019m pleased to say that we see a clear path to achieving that level of savings and that timing. And obviously, we\u2019ll continue to seek out other value-enhancing opportunities as integration activities continue.","As we learn more about Wirtgen\u2019s business, we\u2019re increasingly finding opportunities to leverage the two distribution channels. Just two examples. In the U.S., Deere\u2019s channel was able to fill a coverage gap for Wirtgen in West Virginia while the opposite was true in the Mexico City territory. We anticipate further opportunities to leverage the two channels as integration progresses.","For fiscal year 2018, Wirtgen is forecast to produce $3.2 billion in revenue. Remember, that represents 10 months of ownership. Additionally, we now project that Wirtgen will contribute $100 million in operating profit for the year, even with the unfavorable impact of acquisition costs and purchase accounting. Importantly, Wirtgen is generating strong positive cash flow in the current fiscal year. Beyond 2018, Wirtgen operating margins are estimated to be in the 13% to 14% range and that includes purchase accounting adjustments.","So, finally, I want to shed a little light on what things look like for the overall C&F business for the rest of the year we're moving to slide 15. Deere\u2019s construction and forestry sales are now forecast to be up about 83% in 2018 as a result of stronger demand for equipment as well as the acquisition of Wirtgen. As we said earlier, the revenue forecast includes about $3.2 billion of sales attributed to the acquisition. The forecast for global forestry markets is up 10%, as a result of improvement in sales in the U.S. and Canada, and strong demand for cut-to-length products in Europe and Russia.","C&F\u2019s full year operating margin is now projected to be about 8.5%. That includes the negative impact of purchase accounting and acquisition cost from Wirtgen. Excluding Wirtgen, C&F projects operating margins to be about 11%. That operating profit guidance is partially driven by pricing actions that we\u2019re taking now and will take effect in the second half of the year. We expect to offset material cost inflation and allow for continued margin growth in future quarters.","I\u2019ll turn it back over to Brent.","Brent Norwood","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operations.","Slide 16, shows the provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average owned portfolio. At the end of April, the annualized provision for credit losses was 9 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2018, shown on the slide, contemplates a loss provision of about 21 basis points, 1 basis point lower than our previous forecast. This will put loss provisions for the year just below the 10-year average of 25 basis points and the 15-year average of 27 points.","Moving to slide 17. Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was a $104 million in the second quarter, roughly flat with last year. The results for the quarter included $33 million of net tax reformulated charges, arising from the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and deemed earnings repatriation. For the full year and 2018, net income is forecast to be about $800 million. Excluding the impact for the previously mentioned tax reform-related items, adjusted net income is forecast to be $571 million. Beyond 2018, effective tax rates for John Deere Financial are forecast to be between 24% and 26%.","Slide 18 outlines receivables and inventories. For the Company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter up $4.8 billion. About $200 million of the change relates to currency translation. In the C&F division, the increase is largely attributable to Wirtgen, while for ag, the increase is due to higher sales. By the end of fiscal year 2018, receivables and inventories are expected to increase about $2 billion from 2017 levels, driven largely by the inclusion of Wirtgen, as well as the higher sales across the Company.","Slide 19 shows cost of sales as a percentage of net sales. Cost of sales for the second quarter was 75.2%. Our 2018 cost of sales guidance is about 76% of net sales, up 1% from previous guidance. When modeling 2018, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind, higher production costs such as freight and material costs, and higher incentive compensation costs. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point and a more positive product mix.","Now, let\u2019s look at some additional details. With respect to R&D expense on slide 20, R&D was up 28% in the second quarter. Currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 2 points, while another 10 points is related to the acquisitions of Wirtgen and Blue River Technology. Our 2018 forecast calls for R&D to be up about 20%, with acquisition-related activity accounting for 9 points of the increase and currency translation for 1 point. The balance of the R&D increase relates to strategic investments in large ag and precision ag that help drive growth for these key areas.","Moving now to slide 21. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up 24% in the second quarter with acquisition-related activities, incentive compensation, and currency translation accounting for most of the change. Our 2018 forecast for SA&G expense is up about 18%. Excluding acquisition-related expenses, SA&G is forecast to be up about 2% in 2018.","Turning to slide 22. The equipment operations tax rate was 8% in the second quarter, primarily due to the favorable adjustment of $207 million, arising from tax reform related net deferred tax asset re-measurement and deemed earnings repatriation. For the remainder of the year, the effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 25% to 27%, which implies a full-year effective tax rate of about 56%. Beyond fiscal year 2018, Deere\u2019s effective tax rate is projected to be between 25% and 27%.","Slide 23 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $3.8 billion in 2018 compared to previous guidance of $4.4 billion. The decrease in forecast relates to an anticipated payment of $1 billion towards pension and OPEB liability, net of taxes.","The Company\u2019s financial outlook is on slide 24. Third quarter equipment sales are forecast to be up approximately 35% compared with the same quarter last year. Our full-year outlook now calls for net sales to be up about 30%, which includes about 1 point of price realization and 1 point for positive currency translation.","Finally, our full-year 2018 GAAP net income forecast is now about $2.3 billion. The full-year net income forecast includes charges of $803 million, resulting from tax reform-related net deferred tax asset re-measurement and deemed earnings repatriation. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net income is forecast to be about $3.1 billion. It is important to note, the previous adjusted net income guidance of $2.85 billion excluded the benefit of the lower tax rate in order to compare to our opening budget guidance given in November of 2017. This quarter\u2019s guidance only excludes the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and deemed earnings repatriation but includes the benefit of the ongoing lower tax rate.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Raj Kalathur for closing comments. Raj?","Raj Kalathur","Before we respond to your questions, let me share a few thoughts on the second quarter and our expectations for the rest of the year. First, important to note, we are seeing strong demand across geographical regions from both ag and turf, and C&F divisions. Replacement demand continues to drive equipment sales in large ag as customers express their need for increased precision and productivity enabled by our latest technologies. For C&F, as you heard from Max, strong economic indicators such as GDP growth, housing starts and rising oil prices are generating robust equipment demand, which is reflected in a healthy order book for the remainder of 2018, stretching into 2019.","Second, although the economic environment is largely positive for demand, there are some supply side headwinds to overcome. Material and freight costs have exceeded our forecast for the year due largely to inflation in U.S. steel prices and a tight market for logistics providers. As Max indicated, we are executing pricing actions for the C&F business that will take effect over the remainder of the year. Importantly, these actions should cover material inflation projected for the C&F division. For ag and turf, we generally utilize early order programs for seasonal equipment and an advanced order book for our large tractor products. Orders are typically backed by retail customers. As a result, we typically implement price increases on an annual basis and have a strong history of price utilization over an extended period. As we set prices for the next model year, we will take into consideration not only the additional value that we bring to our customers but also overall market conditions, including inflationary pressures.","At this time, we are confident that our actions, both in making structural cost reductions and in model year \u201819 prices will more than offset inflation in 2019. Lastly, strong levels of demand we are experiencing across our two equipment divisions will result in excellent cash flow generation for the year. Note that we have resumed share repurchases in the second quarter. We also anticipate funding our pension and OPEB liabilities up to $1 billion over the course of the third quarter, in order to take advantage of the previous tax rate of 35%. Additionally, it\u2019s our desire to maintain a dividend payout ratio, it targets 25% to 35% of mid-cycle earnings and can be sustained through the cycle. Based on our performance in the previous cycle and the inclusion of Wirtgen, further dividend increases will be under consideration during the remainder of this year. Overall, we are encouraged by the outlook for improving demand in 2018 and will continue to work and delivering strong results for the remainder of the year. Josh?","Josh Jepsen","Now, we\u2019re ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. In consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. As a reminder, Max Guinn, President of C&F is here with us available for questions as well. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie Cook","Good morning. I guess, two questions. One, Raj, I was hoping that you could elaborate a little more on the supply chain issues in the quarter in terms of, were they the same issues versus last quarter and what\u2019s embedded in the guide for remaining back half for the year? And then, my second question is sort of longer term thinking about margins in the ag business. I mean, it sounds like based on what you\u2019re saying, given you\u2019re going after pricing action, inflation and assuming the markets hold up, should we still -- as we look pass the next two quarters, should we still be able to generate above average incrementals for the ag business, given we\u2019re still well below normalized levels? Thanks.","Raj Kalathur","Hey, Jamie, I think, we will take second one first. We do anticipate strong margins going into the future in ag. None of that has changed. So, the constraints we're facing are more short-term. As we described, it\u2019s purely steel inflation and also logistics inflation. With respect to your question on supply issues, it\u2019s actually improved very nicely. Availability issues are less of a concern now than it was just a couple of months back.","Josh Jepsen","The only thing I would add there is we saw most significant issues we experienced really in the February time frame and we\u2019ve seen improvements since there as we continue to execute and get product out to dealers and customers.","Jamie Cook","But my question is do the supply chain issues constrain your top line at all I guess for the back half of 2019? That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out.","Josh Jepsen","No. I think, when you look at that we actually, you think about both of our divisions, you saw volume actually improve slightly from the previous guidance.","Operator","Our next comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","Hi, good morning everyone, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about how much of the annual raw material cost inflation that we see play out in the second quarter because of the standard cost accounting, can you just give us a rough sense of what proportion of the full-year inflation we recognized in Q2 versus what\u2019s expected in the back half? And can you just flush out the drivers of the better incremental margins in back half? I\u2019m assuming the standard cost accounting is a big driver but maybe you can expand on that a bit more for the ag and turf business.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks, Jerry. I think, when you think about ag and turf, in the second quarter, it was more of an impact of freight. So, as we were trying to make sure we were getting products out to our dealers and customers, we had higher levels of premium freight, expedited freight as we\u2019re working through some of those supply issues. And when you pivot to the back half of the year, you definitely start to see the material come through more so. So, it\u2019s a combination. I\u2019d say second quarter was more freight; the back half of the year, you see more on the material side. As you think about the margins for that business, the second half of the year for ag and turf does have more large ag than we typically would have in a usual year or a typical year. As a result of that, you see better margins and you also see improved pricing as a result of more large ag in the second half. So, that is favorable.","Jerry Revich","And Josh, sorry, just a clarification on the premium rate in 2Q, why are we assuming there is no premium freight in the back half? Have you already seen premium freight down significantly since quarter-end. Can you just flush that out please?","Josh Jepsen","We do expect to see allocated freight, and it\u2019s really as a result of demand and rates moving up. So, we have that in there as well. I said in the back half, you got more weighted to material than freight though. Thanks. We\u2019ll move on to the next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is open.","Mig Dobre","Yes, good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about Wirtgen if we can, a couple of things. I\u2019m trying to understanding within SG&A, exactly, what is this reduction in cost from acquisition-related activities? And, how does this relate to your increased profitability guidance for Wirtgen?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. So, when you think about SA&G, really, as we\u2019re incorporating it into our business, you have a little bit of movement amongst those where those costs are classified. So, largely that\u2019s really adjusting and making changes to their forecast as we incorporate them into our process. As you think about the improvement from zero operating profit to about a 100, it\u2019s about two-thirds really the purchase accounting changes and adjustment and about a third related to operational performance. So, there is some improvement in the underlying business, but the majority is adjustment to purchase accounting.","Operator","Next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research.","Adam Uhlman","Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if we could circle back to the pricing commentary for ag and turf. It sounds like large tractors are -- lead time is already out to October. So, you\u2019d to be putting in some price increases here pretty soon. Could you maybe talk through the magnitude of the increases that you\u2019re considering at this point. And maybe just flush out like how much incremental productivity, material cost savings that you think that you would also have to offset, higher steel costs next year?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. So, on the pricing side, as we think about model year 2019, we do have -- we\u2019ll start early order programs here in a few weeks for seasonal products. So, planters, sprayers, those types of things will come out. As we think about pricing, it\u2019s pretty early to talk about in general. In total, we think that\u2019s going to be varied product to product. Given where we\u2019re at in the year, we do, as Raj mentioned, expect the pricing that we are going to take for 2019 to be more than offsetting the inflationary pressures we\u2019re seeing in 2018 and 2019.","Adam Uhlman","Do you think you need more than the 2% that you\u2019re guiding to for the second half of 2018?","Josh Jepsen","I think it\u2019s fair to assume that. What we\u2019ve done the last few years, we\u2019re going to be higher than that, as a result of that.","Operator","Next question comes from Joe O\u2019Dea with Vertical Research.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Hi. Good morning. Raj, you commented on dividend under consideration and increases there. With respect to just how the strong cash balance is now and the strength, what do you need to gain a little bit more comfort on stepping up on the repurchase front?","Raj Kalathur","So, our cash use priorities have not changed, they\u2019re the same. One of the things we said earlier is we are taking advantage of 35% tax rate, which will not last after fiscal 2017 tax filing. So, that\u2019s the pension and OPEB. And otherwise, it\u2019s a mid-single A [ph] growth investments, with organic and inorganic dividends and finally share repurchases. That\u2019s the priority order that we have articulated and we work towards.","On the dividends, like you said, we are looking at 25% to 35% of mid-cycle earnings. We have seen -- given this strong performance we\u2019ve seen in the recent downturn and considering the growth we anticipate in the future, that\u2019s under consideration, increasing dividends is under consideration.","Share repurchases, which is your question, is residual use of cash. And you\u2019ll notice that we did start buying back shares. And generally, we think about longer term minded investors and the value it brings to long-term minded investors. So, you will see us buy back more shares when there is a larger gap between the intrinsic value of a short-term minded investor versus a longer term minded investor. So, we have, of course as you mentioned, ample firepower in terms of the cash generation that we\u2019re going to have this year and going forward do all of our cash justice.","Operator","Next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.","Rob Wertheimer","Just a quick question on Wirtgen. It seems you took up sales outlook for construction, not for Wirtgen. Is there any reason that those products shouldn\u2019t follow the heavy construction industry? Is there any destock you\u2019re doing or anything else you\u2019re doing in that and what explains it otherwise?","Max Guinn","There is nothing to be read into that. I don\u2019t believe. We think the initial forecast we provided is solid. It does reflect considerable growth in Wirtgen\u2019s business and they\u2019re executing quite well.","Josh Jepsen","The only thing I would add there, Rob too is when we look at the backlog, backlog is up double digits strong. And again, that\u2019s off of what was a very strong 2017 as well.","Operator","Next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ross Gilardi","I first wanted to ask about the pension contribution of $1.1 billion. I mean, given that you did that partly to take advantage of the higher tax rate, should we assume $1 billion bump to cash flow from ops next year? So, I would imagine the contribution wouldn\u2019t be as large. And then, can you just talk a little bit about the persistent weakness we\u2019ve seen in the AEM data for tractors of 100 horsepower and above. I know you guys classify high horsepower tractors as 200 and above. So, I\u2019m wondering that weakness we keep seeing in the data is really more in the midsize segment, which is less of a driver for you. Thanks.","Raj Kalathur","Yes. I will take the first one. In terms of the $1 billion in pension OPEB, yes, it\u2019s clearly opportunistic and taking advantage of that 35% tax rate. We have said our pension plans are well-funded. We do not have any mandatory contribution requirements. And this is -- you can think of this is pulling forward some of our pension contributions into this year and take advantage of 35%. So, from that perspective, you should not see this continue into next year and so on, unless we see another opportunity to take advantage of giving you some high returns. Otherwise, it\u2019s going to be working capital requirements and sales growth. Those are the types of things that will impact the cash flow, as you know.","Ryan Campbell","This is Ryan. Maybe just to add to that on the $1 billion, the impact to operating cash flow this year\u2019s net of tax, and so that\u2019s $650 million. So, it\u2019s a $1 billion minus 35% rate that will get the deduction on that.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. Related to AEM, I think, you\u2019re right. 100 plus is a very large category. So, you are talking utility tractors, midsize tractors and then large row-crop tractors. So, mix there is wide when you think about what portion is high horsepower. I\u2019d say, month-to-month this can be lumpy. We\u2019ve certainly seen weather and timing be adjusted. As we look at this, particularly the rest of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute and believe we are going to see retails -- as we look at our retail order book is very full, really strong position. As Brent mentioned earlier, our large tractor retail order books are out into the October timeframe. So, we feel really good about the order book and the expectation that we are going to see retail maybe slightly shifted in terms of seasonality versus normal but that will continue to come through.","Operator","Next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMC. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Can you guys talk a little bit about how you balance new equipment sales versus the risk of getting back into a used equipment slot? And in particular, can you address it in light of the fact that you are pressing your dealers to take back more of the off leased equipment under their balance sheet? How do you balance, it's great to have new equipment sales, great to have replacement demand, but how do we evolve getting back into the used equipment slot again?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. Ann, I think, when we think about used, there we\u2019ve been focused on this for a number of years, if you think about throughout the downturn. We are down; used equipment is down about 36% from the peak. That\u2019s pretty much where we were a quarter ago. So, we have made great, great strides. And you look across the product categories, we feel like we are in good shape. And we're at [ph] used equipment levels, we haven\u2019t seen since 2012 or before. So, there is a lot of great work done by our dealers and our sales teams to manage that inventory. Row-crop tractors, we\u2019d say, we still got a little bit of work to do, but in better shape than we\u2019ve been in the past. I think, as we balance that, it\u2019s continuing to make sure we are managing that used inventory levels that we are not seeing that grow and rise. And as you think about lease returns, lease returns and when you think about the whole universe of used inventory, only equate to about 5% of the total. So, it\u2019s not a huge amount. We are certainly focused on it and want to work it. And we are working with our dealers to make sure they\u2019re engaged in managing those returns. So, that focus hasn\u2019t changed, working proactively with our dealers and customers as we know leases are maturing to work through those. But, I think we feel good about where we\u2019re at. And definitely, as use inventories come down, we are seeing use prices strengthen, stabilize and start to strengthen, which helps there as well.","Operator","Next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Andy Casey","Couple of questions on Wirtgen. You now expect about $100 million operating profit for the year, pretty much unchanged revenue and the second half implied is about 6% margin. First, what drove the increased operating profit outlook from prior expectations for I think about neutral contribution? And second, can you help us understand how to bridge the 6% second half implied margin outlook for the longer term 13 to 14. And I guess, the core of that question is, should we expect the purchase accounting adjustments outside of the ongoing amortization to be complete by the end of this fiscal year?","Josh Jepsen","So, on the operating margin from zero to about a 100, two thirds of that\u2019s really purchase accounting adjustments, as we continue to work through that on the integration side. The other third is really operational improvement. As you think about the full-year, so now we\u2019re talking about 3% to 4% operating margin for the full-year. You would expect to see improvements from what we\u2019ve done now, kind of building in terms of operating profit throughout the rest of the year to go from where we started, obviously negative in the first quarter to be at about 100 at the end of the year.","Ryan Campbell","This is Ryan, your question is on ongoing the biggest component of purchase accounting this year as the inventories step up, and that will come through the P&L over the -- come through the P&L to date and it will come through over the balance of this year. Next year, it should be clean with that. And you\u2019re just looking at the amortization of the intangibles. That bridges you from the plus or minus 4% or 5% margin this year, up to that 13% to 14% range.","Operator","Next question comes from Mike Shlisky with Seaport Global.","Mike Shlisky","Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about the turf business if I could. I\u2019m seeing some of the companies on the wholesale, even some of the retail outlets have kind of slow start to the spring season due to the weather in March and April. Do you have any comments on what you experienced in Q2 here in turf business? And I think, has that kind of reversed here very recently? I also want to ask, last quarter, last couple of quarters, you actually did mention that Deere expects to gain share in turf. But this quarter that language was not in your comments. So, I\u2019m wondering if you could tell us what has changed there. Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","I think, when you think about turf, the weather, the late spring that we had has impacted that in the quarter. I think, we\u2019ve seen a turn in the weather. So, there is still I think belief that you can catch that up, given the turn in the weather and improvements we are seeing. So, I think there is still confidence that that can be achieved. I think, the commentary in terms of Deere outperforming, no, no change in terms of our expectations on that. So, I wouldn\u2019t read into that.","Operator","Next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven Fisher","In terms of the ag revenue guidance, the implied revenue growth is about 9% in the second half of the year with a little bit of help from currency. So, how did you approach that guidance since the 9% will be a slowdown from a first half? Is that conservative or are there some weaker pieces you have to assume in there? Because it sounds like your overall commentary on ag is actually fairly positive.","Josh Jepsen","Yeah. Steve, I think, as we look at the year, I mean, we took up the full year. When you look at kind of organic for the division, we\u2019ve been up 12% for the year a quarter ago and now up 13%. So, our -- I wouldn\u2019t say, there is an embedded conservatism or weakness there. I mean demand is very strong and we\u2019re seeing that in our order book. So, I think as we look at the full year, we feel good about the demand, customer demand, whether it\u2019s in North America, South America or Europe; we\u2019re seeing that demand and feel good about the year.","Steven Fisher","And so, is the slowdown, is that just comps or\u2026","Josh Jepsen","Yes. I think, it\u2019s really just seasonal.","Steven Fisher","Okay. I\u2019ll follow up. Thanks a lot.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks. Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is open.","Joel Tiss","Hi. How is it going?","Josh Jepsen","Hey, Joel.","Joel Tiss","I wonder if you can talk a little bit about the warranty issue in the C&F business. You just mentioned it and I just wanted to see what it was all about.","Max Guinn","I don\u2019t think we did mention anything on warranty, Joel?","Josh Jepsen","What were you referring to, Joel?","Joel Tiss","Just in the slides that was the warranties were a little bit of negative factor in the profitability. All right. I can follow-up later.","Max Guinn","Yes. Let\u2019s follow-up offline. I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re tracking.","Joel Tiss","And then, on your slide on the global stocks to use, the corn stocks, the use is dropping quite a bit as we go out towards the end of the year. And I just wondered what\u2019s underneath that. Are you taking out some of the Chinese corn that\u2019s been decaying?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. So, just quick, that warranty is actually favorable. So, quarter-over-quarter, Q2 2018 versus Q2 2017 for C&F, warranty is a favorable item, not negative. Stocks use, that is really a story of what\u2019s going on with the demand and slightly lower production for the year. So, there is no exclusion there in terms of stocks, just the tightness we\u2019re seeing there as demand is strong and you\u2019re projecting a little bit of lower production for the year.","Joel Tiss","All right. Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks. Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Emily McLaughlin with RBC. Your line is open.","Emily McLaughlin","Hey, guys. Just a couple of questions. So, your March and April retail sales versus the industry for the U.S. and Canada were a little bit soft. Just wondering do you have any color on that? And then secondly, we are little surprised you didn\u2019t raise your South America forecast, just given the strong order books you mentioned and now maybe a little more favorable in the back half.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. So, on the retail sales, as we mentioned, the month-to-month, there could be movement there. Our view is we\u2019ve -- we feel very confident in our order book and the position of those retail orders. So, feel good about the full year and then what we\u2019d expect to see second half of the year in terms of retail. As you think about South America, basically, we had a little bit of a shift. A quarter ago, we said strength in Argentina and flat to up a little bit in Brazil. We\u2019re seeing that shift now with the drought in Argentina, so a little bit of weakness there, but improved sentiment in Brazil. So, I mean, those were kind of the puts and takes. But to your point, we do feel good about the Brazil demand, the farmer economics are strong from a margin perspective, confidence; FX has the reals weakened, which helps the margin side of the business for those farmers. And then, as it relates to FINANE, we still haven\u2019t had the announcement of what we expect for that program for the second half of this year and the first half of next year, so, the program that will take effect in 1 July. Expectations are that you will see more attractive rates. And as a result, you are seeing customers wanting their deliveries in July and August, but that remains to be seen.","Operator","Next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Courtney Yakavonis","Just another quick question on Wirtgen. I think, you had guided to this quarter adding about 16% to equipment ops and it came in only at 12, and I know you\u2019ve kept the guidance for the year. So, I just want to understand, is that related to the supply chain issues? Was there some other timing discrepancy and how we should think about modeling seasonality wise in next year into 2019?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. So, full-year, maintaining -- I think what we have here is a little bit of timing. And keep in mind there that they own a lot of their distribution. We are trying to forecast, not just sales to dealers but also from a retail perspective. So, I think as we work through that seasonality, it\u2019s taking a little bit of time but no concern on the full year.","Max Guinn","It just reflects the maturing process. Wirtgen\u2019s processes for forecasting were quite a bit of different than ours. There are a lot of entities involved. And they had not traditionally done a monthly forecast. So, it\u2019s a transition issue. It\u2019s not an issue at all for the full year.","Courtney Yakavonis","So, is it safe to say that the majority of that was related to their distribution in Europe as well as to the U.S.?","Max Guinn","It\u2019s just kind of the forecasting process.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. No specific geography.","Max Guinn","No geography.","Operator","Next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is open.","Stanley Elliott","You all mentioned the C&F order book sitting out to 2019. Could you give more commentary, is that kind of normal expectations? Is that a shift with more production class equipment that you have been focusing on or Wirtgen, or what\u2019s really driving that order book out there?","Max Guinn","It\u2019s definitely a shift towards the upper end. And I\u2019d say that both dealers and customers are hungry for equipment. We see some of our largest customers accelerating their purchasing plans for 2019 to make sure that they are prepared to be able to execute work that they have on their books. So, demand is really, really strong and it\u2019s very strong on the big end, if that answers your question.","Stanley Elliott","It does. Thank you. And you mentioned a couple of things on the distribution side in West Virginia and Mexico, is there anything you could share in terms of how the synergies are coming together, either in Europe, Asia, anything along those lines between the Wirtgen and Deere businesses?","Max Guinn","Yes, it\u2019s going to take some time, but I can tell you that we are answering questions on a daily basis from geographies -- from Wirtgen customers and geographies where we are not present in C&F about when we are going to be there. And we are excited about those opportunities but we are also realistic. It\u2019s not just a matter of taking orders and shipping equipment, but it\u2019s making sure that we have the support mechanisms in place and can really take care of those customers the way we know they expect to be taken care of. So, there is lots of opportunity in front of us. It\u2019s going to take a little bit of time.","Operator","Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Yes. Thank you for taking the follow-up. Raj, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about the cadence of ag and turf pricing you\u2019re expecting over next couple of years, based on the product pipeline, also in past five years, I think you realized on average, 2.5% annual price increase due to features upgrades. And I\u2019m wondering if we should be thinking about the next couple of years based on the product line up, any differently at all. Obviously, this year was different from that front line. So, any comments would be helpful.","Raj Kalathur","Jerry, in terms of the pricing, of course, you will appreciate, we\u2019ll not be able to tell you exactly, how much or exactly when. But, I think the points as we provided are as we come with a model year \u201819, we mentioned that around 1 June, we will be taking some of the orders for model year \u201819 and then almost 1 August, we start producing for model year \u201819. Those are the times you will be thinking about price increases, not only for, like you said, some of the value addition that we\u2019ll bring in these products but also looking at the inflationary aspects. So, we do have a healthy model year \u201819 from that regard; it\u2019s going to like the \u201818, \u201819 is going to be there. If you see our R&D investments and innovation we\u2019re adding, you should expect that you can get better. So, our opportunity to get pricing is still going to be pretty positive, and the importance we place in development and research and especially on innovative ideas coming out in the precision ag sector.","Josh Jepsen","I think I\u2019d add there. It\u2019s important, as you think about precision ag, investments that we\u2019ve made, we didn\u2019t pull R&D down significantly during the downturn. So, those are the products that will be coming. And when you think about investments we\u2019re making now, and things like incorporating Blue River and those technologies, machine learning, automation into our product portfolio, that will be coming out in, in the future as well.","Operator","Next question comes from Larry De Maria with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Larry De Maria","Your principal competitor noted they might be a bit more aggressive on price, given where their margins are. Just curious what you are seeing and if you\u2019re willing to give up some share on price and how [ph] is this playing out into 2019 where you start to take some motors? And then, secondly, bigger picture, Europe, just curious where you think we\u2019re in the cycle? We\u2019re seeing some mixed sentiment indicators over there. And curious if you think this is a peak level or for just kind of back to normal Europe, which kind of bounces around at certain levels? Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. Maybe starting on Europe, as we look at historically where we\u2019ve been, we say we\u2019re still below replacement demand levels. So, it\u2019s a market that had -- doesn\u2019t see as wide a fluctuation. So, we didn\u2019t -- haven\u2019t seen high highs or low lows. But we would say when we look at the industry particularly for combines but also for tractors, we\u2019re still below where we consider kind of normal replacement demand.","Raj Kalathur","And on the pricing in general, we think more longer-term the expected pricing, that\u2019s why we think about the value add and ability there, gain more pricing or earn more pricing from our customers. We don\u2019t think about pricing in a short-term mentality. This also gives us loyalty with customers longer term. So, it\u2019s philosophically how we think about pricing.","Larry De Maria","So, the order book is stretching to next year, has new pricing -- or prices increased, and I just want to be clear on that.","Max Guinn","I think your question was about C&F pricing. Is that right?","Larry De Maria","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Max Guinn","Okay. We didn\u2019t hear that at the beginning. I guess, I\u2019d start off by saying, this will be the first year in several years when we have not generated a net cost reduction internally based on some really strong focus on cost reduction. So, we\u2019re going to take the pricing actions we feel are appropriate in the second half to be able to keep our margins improving, as I said earlier. I don\u2019t think -- we don\u2019t have any reason to give up share due to price, I don\u2019t believe. I think, we can earn a good share and manage our pricing well.","Larry De Maria","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Josh Jepsen","The thing to point out there too on the C&F side when you look at that business, ex-Wirtgen, we\u2019re running about 30% incremental margin for the year. So, feel good about that.","Operator","Next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI.","David Raso","Hi. Good morning. Hey, Max, for your C&F growth, pull out Wirtgen, do you expect after the second quarter where ex-Wirtgen sales were up low 20%, the third quarter to be similar kind of growth, just so I understand the cadence for the core business or do you think it slows on comps? Give a sense. And then, I have a follow-up.","Max Guinn","So, it\u2019s similar, David. No, we don\u2019t see any slowdown there.","David Raso","That\u2019s what I thought. So, I\u2019m just trying to figure, we have the rough idea of C&F organic, we have Wirtgen for the third quarter, then it hit the full company sales guidance for the third quarter. That means A&T sales growth for the third quarter has to be about, call it 15%, right. That\u2019s how you get to the full company 35% sales guide for the third quarter. But, if you do that, that implies the fourth quarter A&T is almost giving you zero growth to hit your full year sales guide for A&T of 14. And just given all your color on the order book and so forth, I just want to make sure we understand, are you trying to imply the fourth quarter A&T revenue growth is almost nil or is that just a call it conservatism in the sales guide? Is that -- that is the -- that\u2019s the math.","Josh Jepsen","I mean, I think your math reasonable. I think, when you think about the fourth quarter, the thing that would not be reflected there is we haven\u2019t started our EOP for the spring seasonal products yet. And those we do know as we think about planters and sprayers, will come in, and you start to build those really in the fourth quarter as you\u2019re building those for the spring seasonal delivery. So, I think that\u2019s a piece that where we don\u2019t have visibility yet. Combines, we do -- large tractors, we do those spring seasonal products, we don\u2019t have that visibility yet. And I think that\u2019s where -- what you see there.","David Raso","So, based on the order book right now on ag, just from the things you\u2019ve said, field work we\u2019ve done. I mean, clearly the order book is not suggesting fourth quarter should be flat. Those are just sort of raise your hands and not trying to make a call on the fourth quarter, but you\u2019re not really try to leave us thinking the fourth quarter is flat on the A&T sales, is that a fair summary?","Josh Jepsen","I think that\u2019s fair. Like I said, we\u2019ll obviously -- when we get to the third quarter, we\u2019ll have more visibility into those early order programs. But again, I\u2019d reiterate strong, what we see combines out the year, large tractors into October. So, that remains firm.","David Raso","All right. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","Okay. Well, thanks. We are at the top of the hour. So, we will go ahead and end the call. And we\u2019ll be available for call backs the rest of the day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

(Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tony Huegel, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Tony Huegel","Hello. Also on the call today are Raj Kalathur, our Chief Financial Officer; Marie Ziegler, Deputy Financial Officer; and Susan Karlix, our Manager of Investor Communications.","Today we\u2019ll take a closer look at Deere\u2019s fourth quarter earnings, then spend some time talking about our market and our initial outlook for the fiscal 2014. After that, we will respond to your questions. Please note that slides are available to complement the call this morning. They can be accessed on our website at www.johndeere.com.","First, a reminder. This call is being broadcast live on the internet and recorded for future transmission and use by Deere and NASDAQ OMX.

Participants in the call, including the Q&A session, agree that their likeness and remarks in all media may be stored and used as part of the earnings call.","This call includes forward-looking comments concerning the company\u2019s plans and projections for the future that are subject to important risks and uncertainties. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in the company\u2019s most recent Form 8-K and periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call also may include financial measures that are not in conformance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP.

Susan?","Susan Karlix","Thanks, Tony. Today John Deere wraps up 2013 with the announcement of our fourth quarter results. All in all it was an excellent quarter and marked the end of what CEO Sam Allen called another year of impressive achievement. Fourth quarter earnings were $807 million, the highest ever for the final quarter of the year and our 14th straight quarterly record. The improvement was led by ag and turf which had another strong performance. ","Financial services had higher income as well, and construction and forestry profit held steady despite rocky conditions in some of its key markets. Results for both the quarter and full year reflected a disciplined approach to hearing out the company\u2019s plan and the continuation of positive conditions in the North and South American farm sectors.","For the year as a whole, John Deere had its highest ever level of sales, earnings, shareholder value added and operating return on operating assets. That last metric, operating return on operating assets doesn\u2019t get a lot of headline attention, but it may be the single best indicator of our success delivering profit, while controlling costs and asset levels.","In fiscal 2013, ROA as its known reached the new high of just under 32% with inventories of standard costs. It was in summary a terrific quarter and year and it puts the company squarely in position but what we see as another solid performance in 2014.","Now let\u2019s take a look at the fourth quarter in detail beginning on slide three. Net sales and revenues were $9.5 billion in the quarter, down 3% from the very robust fourth quarter last year.","Recall last year shipments were unusually high due to Interim Tier 4 transition especially in combined and our factories were running at very high rates to catch up with customer orders.","In spite of the decline sales net income attributable to Deere & Company was up 17% to $807 million, which is noted earlier of the highest fourth quarter results the company has ever recorded. EPS was up even more 21% to $2.11.","On slide four, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were $8.6 billion, down 5%, again in comparison with last year\u2019s particularly strong fourth quarter results. This includes an unfavorable impact from currency translation of 2 point, price realization in the quarter was a strong 4 point.","Before looking at Ag and Turf in detail let\u2019s touch on two events in the quarter that will have an impact on the divisions results going forward. On slide five, in October, Deere entered into an agreement for the future sale of 60% of John Deere Landscapes for approximately $300 million. Initially, Deere will retain 40% of the business and we\u2019ll report results as an equity investment in unconsolidated affiliates.","John Deere Landscapes distributes irrigation equipment, nursery products and landscape supplies, such as seed, fertilizer and hardscape materials, primarily to landscape service professionals. The sale is in line with our strategy to focus resources on our growing core businesses.","An example of this focus is illustrated on slide six. In September Deere completed a purchase of Bauer Built Manufacturing allowing us to leverage our global dealer network, manufacturing capability and management skills to continue growing this business.","As you may know, Bauer has manufactured co-branded planters with Deere since 2002 under a design and manufacturing partnership. These planters range in size from 44 to 120 feet in width. The latter being the largest planter in the industry. We have seen demand for the Deere Bauer Series planters grow quickly in the last few years predominantly in North America.","Going forward, not only do we anticipate further market growth in North America, we see a lot of potential in Brazil and Argentina where large farms demand highly productive machines such as this.","We have already localized production of the Deere Bauer Series planters at our Horizontina factory in Brazil and have created a local supply base. These steps supports further growth and add to our highly successful product lineup in the country.","Now let\u2019s turn to review of our individual businesses starting with Agriculture and Turf on slide seven. Sales were down 4% in the quarter, primarily due to lower shipment volume and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by price realization.","In spite of the sales decline, operating profit was up 7% to approximately $1 billion. We believe this is a testament to the execution of our business plan, which stress the rigorous management of costs and assets.","Before we review the industry sales outlook let\u2019s look at fundamentals effecting the Ag business. Slide eight outline U.S. farm cash receipts, which are forecast to be down somewhat from 2013. Grain production levels are expected to be up in 2014, resulting in lower prices. Livestock receipts are forecast to be about flat with 2013 level. As a result, our forecast calls for 2014 cash receipts to be approximately $380 billion, down about 4% from 2013, which was the second highest level ever recorded. 2014 cash receipts, the number one predictor of farm equipment sales, are expected to remain at a historically high level, which should help keep farmers in a financially sound position. ","On Slide 9, global grain stocks used remained at historically low level. Due in part to good weather globally, yields will be higher resulting in lower commodity prices. However global corn stocks used are only expected to increase by about 2%. According to our consultant Informa [ph], there is already talk about among U.S. farmers looking ahead to the 2004 [ph] planting season, about adjusting corn acreage down by about 4% in favor of soybeans. ","Looking at South America, Informa is forecasting a cut in planted corn area of about 10% in Brazil and of about 30% in Argentina. The drop in Argentina is due to planting delays for corn as well as economics of lower corn prices relative to beans. If 2014 brings unfavorable growing conditions in any part of the world, the U.S., Brazil, and Argentina in particular, corn stock fees [ph] would fall, suggesting the commodity prices would stabilize. ","Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 10. Beef and pork prices are at historic highs and milk prices are favorable, supporting livestock and dairy farmers. While remaining near long term averages, grain prices and farm income are expected to be lower in 2014. While it appears that short term economic stress has diminished for now, concerns over slow European Union growth are weighing on farmer confidence. As a result, farm machinery demand is expected to be lower in 2014. ","On Slide 11, you will see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In the CIS, import policies continue to affect combined sales in Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. In Russia, heavy rain affected fall planting, putting some of the 2014 winter crop at risk. And credit availability there continues to weigh on equipment sales. ","Turning to China and India, government support as well as a favorable monsoon season in India allowed for slightly improved industry outlook. ","Slide 12 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agro business in Brazil. The 2014 value of ag production in Brazil is expected to increase about 3% over the 2013 level. Brazil soybean production is expected to increase again in 2013-2014 on the heels of historically high prices and margins. Government financing is expected to remain favorable but likely at higher rates. On the other hand, lower global commodity prices will reduce farm income. ","Our 2014 ag and turf industry outlook are summarized on Slide 13. In the U.S. and Canada, we expect an industry decline of 5% to 10%, mainly reflecting lower sales of large equipment such as high horsepower tractors and combines. The EU 28 industry outlook is down about 5% due to lower commodity prices and farm income. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be down 5% to 10% from 2013\u2019s strong levels. ","South America continues to grow in importance for Deere. Our tractor market share has grown considerably there and our strong position in other products such as combines, sugarcane harvesters, sprayers and feeding equipment should not go unnoticed. Shifting to the CIS, we expect industry sales to be down slightly, while in Asia, sales are projected to be up slightly. ","Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be up about 5% in 2014.","Market conditions are improving in tandem with the slow economic recovery. Also the pent-up demand seen in late 2013 is expected to continue, mainly benefiting the riding lawn equipment and utility vehicle segments.","Putting this all together on Slide 14, fiscal year 2014 Deere sales of worldwide Ag and Turf equipment are forecast to be down about 6%. As discussed earlier, the forecast contemplates the sale of 60% of John Deere landscape\u2019s operations.","In the year-over-year comparison of net sales, landscapes accounts for about four points of A&T\u2019s change. On a comparable basis, the change in worldwide Ag and Turf sales is down about 2% in 2014.","2014 operating margins for the Ag and Turf divisions is forecast at about 15%. The one point decline from 2013 is a result of implementation cost of Final Tier 4 on large Ag equipment and a return to more normal product mix.","As you may recall, we have talked for some time about mix benefiting margins by one to two points due to the strength of large ag. Finally, Ag and Turf price realization is projected to be positive.","Let\u2019s focus now on construction and forestry on Slide 15. Net sales were down 8% in the quarter and operating profit was down 2%. The $132 million decline in sales with only $2 million reduction in operating profit is a reflection of price realization, good execution and lever pulling to control cost in response to slower demand.","On Slide 16, looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, the economy continues slowly moving forward. Although government construction continues to fall and the situation in Washington remains uncertain, we are beginning to see some positive indicators.","Home sales and prices are improving and residential construction is growing. Some markets are seeing building lot shortages and architect and builders are reporting more activity. Global forestry markets are expected to be up about 5% in 2014.","Following double-digit growth in 2013, North American forestry markets are expected up about 5% while Europe and Russia are expected to improve from the depressed levels of 2013. Fiscal 2014 net sales in construction and forestry are forecast to be up about 10%. The increase reflects increased shipments following the low levels of 2013 in response to an improving U.S. economy.","As we move into 2014, Deere\u2019s inventories of new fresh machines as a percentage of sales are at all-time lows. That gives us the ability to quickly respond to improving market conditions. Division also will benefit from increased international sales as its factories in Brazil and China began low levels of production. C&F full-year operating margin is projected to be about 9%.","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operations. Slide 17 shows the financial services provision for credit losses at 3 basis points based on the percentage of the total average-owned portfolio at the end of the year. This reflects the excellent quality of our portfolios and recoveries from prior year\u2019s write-off.","Our 2014 financial forecast contemplates the loss provision of about 16 basis points as a percentage of the average-owned portfolio. The increased provision is a result of unsustainably low loss levels of the last three years. Even with the forecast increase, losses would remain well below the 10-year average of about 28 basis points and a 15-year average of 48 basis points.","Moving to Slide 18, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $157 million in the fourth quarter, versus $122 million last year. 2014 net income attributable to Deere & Company is forecast to be about $600 million. That compares with $565 million in 2013.","Slide 19 outlines receivables and inventory. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventory ended the year down $276 million, equal to approximately 24.8% of prior 12 month sales, compared with 26.8% a year ago. Receivables and inventories ended the year at about 25.9% of prior 12 month sales, including the impact of $372 million of receivables and inventories for John Deere Landscapes that were reclassified to assets held for sale. ","Ag and turf ending receivables and inventory were up $269 million, including the assets held for sale mentioned above. Construction and forestry ended the year with $173 million \u2013 ended the year down $173 million, putting us in prime position to react to improving markets. We expect to end 2014 with receivables and inventory down about $150 million, reflecting strong asset management in both divisions. ","Our 2014 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales is shown on Slide 20, and of course, it has to be about 74%. When modeling 2014, keep in mind the following: price about 2 points and unfavorable mix of product as we talked about earlier, here for product costs, overhead spend due to higher employment levels and lower pension and OPEB expense.","Looking at R&D expense on Slide 21. R&D was up about 1% in the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year and up about 3% for the full year. Our 2014 forecast calls for R&D expense to be down about 3% for the full year. ","Moving now to Slide 22. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down about 1% in the fourth quarter and up about 5% for the full year. SA&G expense is forecast to be down about 4% in 2014. In the year-over-year comparison of SA&G expenses, Landscapes accounts for about 8 points of the change. ","On Slide 23, pension and OPEB expense was down about $5 million in the quarter compared with last year and up about $65 million for the full year. Pension and OPEB expense is forecast to be down $150 million in 2014 due to a higher discount rate and strong asset performance. ","Turning to Slide 24. The equipment operations tax rate was approximately 35% in the fourth quarter and about 36% for the full year. For the full year 2014, the effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%. ","On Slide 25, you see our equipment operation\u2019s history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from equipment operations was approximately $4.7 billion in 2013. Our 2014 forecast is about $3.9 billion. ","Slide 26 outlines our use of cash priorities which are unchanged and no doubt familiar to many of you. Our number one priority is to manage the balance sheet, including liquidity to support the rating that provides access to low cost and readily available short and long-term funding. Thus Deere is strongly committed to its A rating.","Our second use of cash priority is funding value creating investments in our operation. Our third priority is to provide for the common stock dividend, which we have raised 82% since 2010. Over time we want to consistently deliver a series of moderately increased dividends while targeting a 25% to 35% payout ratio on average. In this regard, we are mindful of the importance of maintaining the dividend and not growing at a point that can be [indiscernible] by our cash flow. ","Share repurchase is our method of deploying excess cash, once the previous requirements are met and as long as such repurchase is value-enhancing. From 2004 to 2013, we have returned about 58% of cash from the equipment operation to shareholder through dividends and share repurchase. ","On Slide 27, we outline our 2014 outlook for the first quarter and full year. Our net sales forecast for the first quarter is down about 2% compared with 2013. This includes about 3 points of price realization. In a year-over-year comparison to the first quarter sales Landscapes accounts were about two points of that change. The full-year forecast held for net sales to be down about 3%. In the year-over-year comparison of worldwide net sales, landscapes accounts were about three points of the change. On a comparable basis, the change in 2014 net sales is about flat with the strong level of 2013. Price realization is expected to be positive by about two points.","Finally, our full-year 2014 net income forecast is about $3.3 billion. In closing, John Deere enters 2014 on a strong pace. As mentioned, we are expecting the world\u2019s Ag market to relax a bit next year and the sales of farm machinery to be somewhat lower. But we also expect to see improvement in our construction business and benefits from our global investment and new factories.","At the same time, our plans will continue, moving ahead to pursue new market at productive new models of equipment and expand our global customer base. John Deere in our view remains well positioned to respond to the needs of the growing world, and equally well positioned to provide significant benefits to our investors in the years ahead.","I will now turn the call over to Raj.","Raj Kalathur","Yeah. I will take a minute to recognize Marie Ziegler. As many of you know, Marie Ziegler, Deere\u2019s long time Head of Investor Relations and currently Deputy Financial -- Chief Financial Officer, will be retiring soon after 35 years with the company. Over this time, she has become well-known to the investment community as Deere\u2019s primary face and voice. She initiated Deere\u2019s quarterly conference calls in 1990s, and has been knowledgeable and authoritative presence on them ever since.","Indeed, Marie essentially created the Deere IR function and has developed quite a reputation in the field for efforts to build strong relations with the company\u2019s investors. She has also developed employees and capabilities at Deere to sustain our reputation in this field for the long-term.","This is Marie\u2019s final call. She'll be missed by all of us, but her many contributions to the company, its investors and to the practice of Investor Relations itself will no doubt be felt for years to come. I'm sure Marie\u2019s friends in the analyst community join those of us at Deere and wishing her much health and happiness as she enters next chapter of her life.","Thank you, Marie.","Tony Huegel","Okay. Now, we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. But as a reminder in consideration of others, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Jamie Cook. And please state your company name.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Hi. Good morning, Credit Suisse. And congratulations, Marie, we will miss you a lot. I guess just my question relates to -- if you could provide a little more color on what your assumptions are? You said within -- when we think about the Ag business, we should think about Tier 4 and what the implications are? Can you just give us a little more color on what you\u2019ve seen in the costs are sort of associated -- associated with that as well as what you are assuming with material cost this year? I guess I will start off with that.","Raj Kalathur","Sure. And as you are aware last year, we did change our guidance somewhat and we are giving an overall cost of sales number and so we are no longer giving the details of the moving pieces. I think, as Susan went through the list of things to keep in mind in terms of those items that are creating a higher cost mix would be the largest and then Tier 4 emissions cost would be the second largest. You will know the absence of a reference to material costs, which I think from there, you can infer that the impact is not material enough to mention.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","All right. I guess my second question, what struck me about your forecast in a down Ag market, the earnings that you're going to be able to put up. So you talked about R&D being down I think 3% or something like that year-over-year. Can you just talk about sort of structurally should R&D continue to come down as a percent of sales with some of the major expense initiatives over, your ability to hole up profits and potentially a much softer ag equipment market? Thanks and I will get back in queue.","Raj Kalathur","Sure, I think with the R&D reduction, it\u2019s fair to note first of all, Susan had mentioned the reduction in pension and OPEB expense and that does impact R&D to some degree, so that\u2019s part of the reduction. And so I would argue we are really not flat, or little below flat but closer to that if you take out the impact of the pension and OPEB. But it does reflect our focus on continuing to maintain the cost to your point as we move through final tier 4 now and as we \u2013 2015 we have a significant number of products coming in as well, and as we continue to move through that, it would be fair to expect, all things being equal, to start to see some reduction in R&D, and of course, that\u2019s assuming there aren\u2019t other additional opportunities with new products of sorts of things. ","Marie Ziegler","Chime into that, when we look at our R&D spend, Jamie, we are looking at the long term and the opportunities and we are investing for growth. And while, of course, depending on business conditions, we\u2019re going to be very mindful of that, we really have our eye on the long term when we consider that. You shouldn\u2019t really look at a near term market condition per se and correlate that to the R&D spend, because the lead times and investment horizon is much longer. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Adam Uhlman and please state your company name.","Adam Uhlman \u2013 Cleveland Research","Hi, it\u2019s Cleveland Research. I was wondering if we can start with the revenue forecast for the global ag market \u2013 was the market forecast down 5% to 10% or so but revenue is down only a little bit less than that. The price realization outlook does look like that\u2019s going to be easing as the year progresses with pricing 3% for the company going down to 2% for the year. So I was wondering if you could walk through some of those moving pieces.","Tony Huegel","Yes. Keep in mind that the industry guidance would not include, you pointed out pricing, so as we are forecasting 2 points of positive price realization for 2014, of course, ag would be contributing to that. So that wouldn\u2019t be included market share gains and expectations also would not be included in those industry outlook. The other thing and Susan highlighted that is keep in mind, South America is only focused on \u2013 in terms of our outlook only referring to combines and tractors. And for Deere, there is significant opportunities for a full product offer \u2013 have a full product offering in South America, things like sugarcane harvesters, planters, Susan also mentioned the Deere power plant which is localized in Brazil now, sprayers that we have recently localized, that we have a lot of opportunity beyond that there. And of course, CIS and Asia are not numerically represented. So those are a few items that cause some disparity between the industry outlook and end of year guidance. ","Adam Uhlman \u2013 Cleveland Research","And then Tony, could you also address what the order book looks like right now in total and also for the large ag product please? ","Tony Huegel","Yes. Most of the commentary we would have would be around a large ag in particular as we look at the one most, or a couple that most are focused on are combines and large tractors. In the early order program for combines, keep in mind it\u2019s a little hard because of some of the timing differences in our 2013 and 2014 early order programs. We have a much earlier start this year as part of our final tier 4 transition. But what we will tell you is combines today are down year over year on orders. That\u2019s reflected in our outlook. As you look at large tractors, however, it\u2019s still a very, very strong order book. It is open through the end of May today. And so if you look at 8R tractors, our availability on 8R tractors is out to basically early June this year on the wheel tractor. Last year that would have been around April timeframe and then if you look at our 9R tractors again on the wheel variety, available is March this year, of 2014 last year, we would have been in the February timeframe. So both of those are running a little ahead.","Track tractors conversely are about a month or so lighter than where we were last year. So 8R trac availability in April versus May last year and then nine hours of February versus May of last year. But still overall a pretty strong order book as we look out into especially the first half of next year.","Adam Uhlman \u2013 Cleveland Research","Great. Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Rob Wertheimer and please, state your company name.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","It\u2019s Vertical Research Partners. Good morning, everybody.","Tony Huegel","","Hey Rob.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","So, let me just see if I can follow up on that, so it seems as though your more cautious outlook on industry volumes next year is a little bit more driven by assumption than it is by orders on the ground, unless you have got production cuts embedded in those longer -- longer lead times year-over-year? Is that correct or is the comp much down enough to offset that?","Tony Huegel","No. You would be correct and as we talked about tractors, you would have, if you looked at a numeric basis, you are -- more apple-to-apples if anything you have a little bit higher volume in terms of numbers of tractors in the 2014 order book versus the 2013. So it would actually be the opposite on tractors.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","Yeah. Perfect. And then can you walk through a little bit just the timing of pricing as you go from Tier 4 I to Tier 4 Final, especially in Europe [indiscernible] have Ag technical at least some people have sort of engines stock piled both in large public competitors than smaller ones? And then I think you have done a stub pricing on combined starting in November for the old tier but not -- but can you kind of walk through when you started raising pricing? And then I assume as your volume outlook for unit sales fades throughout the year what is offsetting us that is pricing, so I just wanted to see if you go market by market when that pricing kicks in? Thanks.","Tony Huegel","Yeah. If you think about, the pricing, certainly you are right. We did as we started our model, yeah, we did have some stub price, some lighter price increases and the Interim Tier 4 product that we are producing ahead of the transition\u2026","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","That starts in November, sorry.","Tony Huegel","\u2026 and we will have, pardon me, yeah, that would have been effective in November on combined.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","Yeah.","Tony Huegel","And then when we begin our transition in January and start shipping final Tier 4, of course there will be a bit of another bump in pricing with the final Tier 4 product. Similar situation with the 8R Tractors, you have a smaller price increase beginning in November on the IT4 product. Again that 8R as you might recall transitioned in April timeframe. 7R is a little less impacted, it is similar to combined it\u2019s transitioning in January timeframe.","Marie Ziegler","But remember that the price increases that are associated with the final Tier 4, it was the compliance are not included in price because we consider that buy-in because you are getting something different or new with that and so it is all stripped out and reclass into volume. So you won't see that in that 2% number.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","No. For summary. Thank you very much. Are you able to say on Europe, I don\u2019t know whether you are going to go over the new machines in January or more like on average on July, August, September?","Marie Ziegler","Europe is the market -- primary market in Europe is the smaller horsepower, so that\u2019s really not the first phase of final Tier 4. I think, I can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s called in Europe stage 4 or something like that. But that\u2019s really a 2015 now phenomena, yes.","Tony Huegel","Yeah. Exactly. And to your point though, keep in mind in Europe, it\u2019s based on when the effective date is based on when the engine is produced not when in the U.S. where it is based on where when the equipment begins final production. So there is a little bit difference strategy in terms of how you plan for those transitions for Europe versus the U.S.","Marie Ziegler","Yeah. I call this is -- I think I said smaller market initiatives\u2026","Tony Huegel","Lower\u2026","Marie Ziegler","Lower horsepower tractors.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. Thanks, Marie, and good luck.","Marie Ziegler","Thank you.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","Thanks Tony.","Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Steve Volkmann and please state your company name.","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies","It\u2019s Jefferies. Good morning, everybody.","Marie Ziegler","Good morning.","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies","Maria, thank you. You are the first person I met in 1998 when I started covering this group. So I appreciate all of your insights.","Marie Ziegler","Thank you.","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies","So on to business. I\u2019m wondering if we could focus just a little bit on Brazil, I am curious if you think that the market share gains in Ag that you had down there will continue or do you sort of recheck a balancing point at some point? And then maybe on the construction side, how much do we think we\u2019ll actually get out of those plants down there in 2014?","Tony Huegel","Sure. And the answer to the first question is specifically related to tractors in terms of market share, absolutely. We believe we will continue to gain traction and gain market share in that market. We continue to localize products. We talked about the 8R tractor will be localized by the end of 2015, but as we continue to leverage that dealer distribution, as we continue to leverage our full product offering that we have available in country, we fully expect that, that market share trend will continue. ","As it relates to construction, of course, as with any new factory we will ramp up a little slower but in terms of important for Deere, keep in mind that this is also the first full year that we will have our distribution in place in Brazil. So as you look at the sales increase for construction and forestry, certainly you are beginning to see \u2013 and I think Susan mentioned in the opening comments, we are beginning to see some benefit from those investments like Brazil, of course our China facility, we exported significant portion of that into the Russian market. So we will see some benefit there, and then of course, forestry starting to recover outside of the U.S. and Canada as well. But certainly we will begin to see some benefit from those operations. ","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies","Okay, and then I guess my related follow up, there seems to be quite a bit of confusion about the availability of tsunami financing in various end markets down there in 2014. Do you have any intelligence for that?","Tony Huegel","Yes, at this point we still feel that the tsunami program will continue to be very supportive to sales. I think there was some confusion or some concerns around the recent announcement that was made that\u2019s limiting a bit of the 2013 \u2013 the remaining 2013 financing that\u2019s available. Really as we look at that our view is it\u2019s really regulating kind of that year end process as they transition to the 2014. What\u2019s happened is that \u2013 there\u2019s two ways you can apply for that financing under the conventional application process which is a little bit longer term, you also have longer lead time. That basically was the standard you have it until the end of November to deliver product. But there is still the opportunity to get that 3.5% interest rate through the simplified application process. So the funds are still available. ","As you look out into 2014, maybe more to your question, we fully expect that there will be a tsunami program in place at the beginning of 2014. While nothing specifically has been announced, most are expecting that, that interest rate will increase. And our best estimate is somewhere in the 4.5% to 5.5% interest rate versus the 3.5% this year on the back half of 2013. But again continue to believe that it will be very supportive for equipment sales. And that is all fully factored into our outlook.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ross Gilardi and please state your company name. ","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America","Yes, thanks very much. Bank of America. Hey, I was just wondering \u2013 can you elaborate a little bit more on Europe on the back of Agritechnica and sort of demand levels there in your forecast are a little bit weaker outlook for 2014 and any color on the UK versus other parts of Europe versus Scandinavia, for example?","Tony Huegel","Sure. I think generally speaking, again we are looking for the market \u2013 the industry to be a little softer and it\u2019s really reflective, I think, overall as you look at lower farm income as a result of the lower commodity prices. But certainly that\u2019s still at very strong level and very supportive levels that year over year it would be down somewhat. Livestock margins, of course, will benefit from those lower commodity prices. So you are seeing some strength there as well. As you look at some of the moving pieces, certainly the UK we would expect to see some recovery. As you might remember, 2013 was a down year on demand in the UK as a result of some of the weather impact that\u2019s a very wet, both harvest of 2012 and into the planting season of 2013, actually seen some recovery in Spain as well. Conversely, you\u2019re seeing France one of our larger market that you\u2019re seeing a little bit of weakness there. Again, following a very strong 2013, so still a good level, but seeing a little bit of weakness as we go into 2014, year-over-year.","Marie Ziegler","And I will just add that France actually is the largest agriculture equipment market in the EU 28, so as they go that does have an impact on the overall outlook.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America","Okay. Thank you. And then just on construction and forestry, clearly you\u2019ve managed your profitability very well in your working capital. But you seem to be going into 2014 as with others on a somewhat weak note from a topline perspective. So aside from the different macro indicators and so forth, what gives you the confidence in a construction outlook to call for 10% growth at this point?","Tony Huegel","Well, I think as we mentioned before, certainly as you look at the U.S. market, U.S. and Canada markets and look at the underlying fundamentals, they are much improved as we go forward. You look at things like GDP forecast at 2.5% versus the 1.5% in \u201913.","Marie Ziegler","If you can call that much improvement.","Tony Huegel","But it\u2019s in a right direction. Housing starts being -- yet again in the forecast for 2014. We are starting to see some site development, financing we\u2019re not picking up. You\u2019re not seeing that continuing to drop off, so you have the underlying fundamentals. But again keep in mind as we look at that up 10%, that also is reflecting some strength outside of the U.S. and Canada as well, as we continue to invest in those businesses, we\u2019re starting to see that payoff in sales.","Marie Ziegler","And the fact that we\u2019re able to build demand as opposed to reducing inventory, which we did during 2013, so the combination collectively gives us and up 10%.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America","Great. Thanks very much.","Raj Kalathur","All right. Thanks. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Eli Lustgarten. And please state your company name.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Longbow Securities. Good morning, everyone and obviously Marie, we\u2019ve had a long relationship. I\u2019m going to miss you an awful lot. I wish you the best.","Marie Ziegler","Thank you, my pleasure.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Can I have one clarification with the sale of John D of the landscaping, portion of ownership in the 2014? You took a $45 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter. That is about $0.08. Is there a gain that\u2019s going to be associated with the $300 million that you\u2019re going to get in your 2014 forecast? You said, it\u2019s part of it, but is there a gain associated with the $300 million?","Raj Kalathur","No.","Marie Ziegler","No.","Raj Kalathur","No. There would not be.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","In the fair value, is it -- which you own is $80 million, employing is worth $90 million ","Tony Huegel","The $45 million would reflect what the fair value is based on the terms of the agreement.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Yeah. So there would be no gain on the $300 million that you\u2019re getting?","Tony Huegel","Correct.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","And as we talk a little bit at the outlook, I mean the biggest change that happen on Friday night was the ethanol ruling on the national fuel standard to reduce the amount of corn ethanol that\u2019s going to be likely for 2014 and that\u2019s going to raise the carryover somewhat materially if it actually goes through, have you embedded that your forecasting outlook for this year?","Marie Ziegler","Absolutely. That was done actually, even though it was leaked in October, the rumors and the expectations have been in play long before that. So that is fully factored into our outlook.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","You expect to see that. And can you talk about -- I mean the profitability Ag was far higher than the guidance we got initially. We were 15% -- we came in at 16% with a very, very strong fourth quarter. Was that just strictly volume going -- volume and pricing going through and the difference declined to 15%, is the same thing as the changes that you gave us? Or is there anything else happening in the quarter that gives us a strong profitability?","Tony Huegel","Again, I think as you look certainly, you had production costs were -- as you look at the fourth quarter, our price realization was the biggest piece we did. [S&G] was down year-over-year in the quarter as well. So, I think kind of the spending price and spending was the biggest impact.","Marie Ziegler","We come in a whole point better on the price and what we would have purposely projected.","Raj Kalathur","Eli, on the John Deere landscapes, you are right that there is no accounting gain. But I want you to understand that economically it was a good decision for us.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","I know, absolutely there was no accounting gain embedded in the guidance that you gave us. And the 9% margin in construction is due to the higher volume -- ","Tony Huegel","Largely driven by better volume, absolutely.","Marie Ziegler","We have a little more favorable mix, that\u2019s been an issue this year. So but the mix is primarily volume. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Nicole DeBlase and please state your company name.","Nicole DeBlase \u2013 Morgan Stanley ","That is Morgan Stanley. I was hoping you might be able to talk a little bit about \u2013 within the 5% to 10% decline forecast within the U.S. and Canada ag, what is the outlook for large versus small and medium ag?","Tony Huegel","Yes, I think certainly as we mentioned in the opening comments and you are looking at a greater decline, closer to lower double digits in the large ag and some strength in small ag.","Nicole DeBlase \u2013 Morgan Stanley ","And then can you just give a sense of how used equipment inventory is tracking on the ag side?","Tony Huegel","Sure. As you look at used, again I think the two categories, most are asking about the large tractors and combines. As you look at used equipment levels in the quarter, combines\u2019 actually inventories dropped very considerably during our fourth quarter, about a 25% drop from July to October. So that\u2019s been a very good sign. Used tractor inventory on the flip side is up, and certainly that\u2019s reflective of the higher demand level we\u2019ve had on new equipment. But we are seeing higher levels of tractors and certainly are focused on that and monitoring that closely.","Marie Ziegler","But pricing on used tractors is actually up single digit and the turnover continues to be very good. Combines are down a little from very high level but still at good level. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Mircea Dobre and please state your company name. ","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird","Good morning. Robert W. Baird & Company. Marie, first congrats and good luck going forward. I guess the first question from me was kind of a housekeeping question. Looking at JD Landscapes, can you help us with operating income impact on 2014, you helped us with the revenue?","Marie Ziegler","There is not much of an impact. I would \u2013 you can just consider them neutral. They were profitable but the absence of the impairment is probably a [indiscernible]. ","Raj Kalathur","Just think of it as slightly accretive going forward.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird","And sort of in the same vein, looking at financial services, income is expected to increase slightly about 35 million versus 13. But ag volumes generally speaking are challenged. I guess I am wondering what exactly is it to drive this growth next year in financial services?","Marie Ziegler","The portfolio was up significantly, we are up about $5 billion this year. And so you get the benefit of having that larger portfolio for the year. ","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird","So you are not really expecting a contraction in the portfolio given lower volumes?","Marie Ziegler","Correct. We expect that \u2013 in next year we are actually projecting further growth in the portfolio.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird","Then the last question for me would be one on pricing. I am trying to sort of equate your expectations for pricing in \u201914 given that most ag end markets are expected to actually see decline in volume. What is --","Marie Ziegler","Remember when you talk about a portfolio for credit, the notes are written with five year life and I think our average life is in the range of 2 to 2.5 years. So one year\u2019s activity in terms of sales will impact that portfolio for up to five years. Does that help?","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird","It\u2019s helped. Thank you. And I don\u2019t know if you caught my last one on pricing. I am wondering what\u2019s the dealer\u2019s perspective in your conversations with your dealers, how are they thinking about their ability to push through the price increases that you are talking about?","Tony Huegel","Certainly that would be \u2013 as we set our pricing and so on, that would be one of the factors we are considering. So it\u2019s all included in our outlook, and so that up to 2 points of price realization in the year is what we would anticipate being able to do. ","Marie Ziegler","We just had a larger number of new product introductions. We believe we will be adding significant value into the market and we think that will that -- certainly help support our ability to get that price realization.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird","Thank you.","Tony Huegel","","Okay. Next caller?","Marie Ziegler","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question comes from Seth Weber and please state your company name.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is actually [Daniel] on for Seth of RBC Capital Markets.","Marie Ziegler","","Hi Daniel.","Unidentified Analyst","","Hi. So I guess my question was on pricing. This year it's up 2%, I guess it's a little lower than prior year. So I guess, is this kind of a function of mix with less big equipment or are markets getting\u2026","Marie Ziegler","","Yes, that would certainly have -- play a very big role in it. As you see the large Ag softening a little and small Ag stepping up a bit. You don't necessarily have the same impact on pricing and a lot of new product introductions of the last year really were targeted at large Ag and again price introduction schedules have been driven by the compliance with the Final Tier 4 missions. So you will see a round of activities in the coming year or two related that had smaller things -- smaller products that will help support pricing there as well. Tony, do you have anything to add?","Tony Huegel","","I do not.","Unidentified Analyst","All right, Have markets been getting more competitive at all as well or it's just really the mix?","Marie Ziegler","","I think its mix. I wouldn't say the markets however are not competitive.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And I guess one quick follow up just on Bonus Depreciation, is this kind of based in your forecast or\u2026?","Tony Huegel","","Yes. We certainly -- as we are looking into next year our base case would assume, the Bonus Depreciation does not get renewed.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Tony Huegel","","And on Section 179 just, you know, obviously there is a -- as you look at Section 179, we believe there is a better or potentially you would see some extension there. Our base case given the uncertainty in at least in our outlook is based on kind of in the middle ground where it would be extended but it would be at $250,000 versus the 500 this year. Okay, next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes\u2026","Tony Huegel","","This will be our last question.","Operator","","Thank you. The final question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz, and please state your company name.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays","Good morning guys. It\u2019s Barclays. Nice quarter. Marie, congratulations and enjoy.","Marie Ziegler","Thank you, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays","","So can you talk about your cash generation in the quarter, it was way higher than we modeled. I know there is some noise, I guess from JD Landscapes in the accounting but is anything you did differently in the quarter or it just lower inventories and just better working capital management when it comes down to it?","Marie Ziegler","","Actually, we had better income. You have the impairments which actually further helped fizzle through our non-cash charges. Our accrued taxes came in a little lower and payables also were favorable. Those are really the big items affecting the cash flow generation in the quarter, that versus our expectations.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays","Okay, so Marie I\u2019m going to try and ask a share repurchase question and I know Tony is going to not want to give me the answer but I am going to ask it anyway. Could we think at least that your recent share repurchase behavior is more representative of what we might expect going forward versus your cautiousness of the beginning of FY \u201813 despite what we\u2019ve seen from corn prices lately and continued uncertainty but how do we look at what was a very strong 4Q, I thought in repurchases?","Marie Ziegler","I think as we got confidence and certainly saw the cash flow coming in better in the quarter you saw, able to respond better. In any given quarter, it's very difficult to read anything into our future plans. I am going to tell you, in first quarter you can expect that we are going to typically be fairly cautious because remember we are big users of cash in that first quarter.","So you again want to look at our activities over the course of the year. This year we returned 50% of our cash through dividends in share repurchase and over the last decade we have been running more like 55% to 60%. We are very proud of that track record. And we have always said that we are interested in being known as the company that has a long history of making dividend increases and we kept our word on that.","It's not necessarily every year at a fixed period but consistently. And then secondly, we very much view share repurchase as the way we return our cash and looking at the cash projections, there would be some hope for those of you cheering on share repurchase but you will continue to see that.","Raj Kalathur","","So Andy I would add that the seeds from the sale of John Deere Landscapes are $300 million in cash. That is something that you should expect us to use for our share repurchases over the next 12 months as well?","Marie Ziegler","Yeah. And that is not in our cash flow number because that\u2019s cash generated by industry activity, so that would be [indiscernible]. And with that, we\u2019re going to need to wrap up. So I\u2019m going to just sign off on my 83rd conference call. Thank you all.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tony Huegel, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Tony Huegel","Hello. Also on the call today are Raj Kalathur, our Chief Financial Officer; Marie Ziegler, Vice President and Treasurer; and Susan Karlix, Manager, Investor Communications.","Today, we\u2019ll take a closer look at Deere\u2019s fourth quarter earnings and full-year results then spend some time talking about our markets and the outlook for 2013. After that, we\u2019ll respond to your questions. Please note that slides are available to complement the call this morning. They can be accessed on our website at www.johndeere.com.","First, a reminder.

First, let me say how pleased I am to be part of today\u2019s call. To give you some background about who I am, I joined John Deere in 1997 and have spent my career in different functional areas, starting in finance, including business development, sales and marketing and operations in North American and Asian locations. Before becoming the Deputy Financial Officer in April 2012, I was based in Singapore as Vice President of Sales and Marketing for our ag and turf businesses in Asia and Africa. Before that, I was Managing Director of the company\u2019s India operations. I\u2019m looking forward to bringing the benefit of my business experience to my role as CFO and to working with our Investor Relations team and many of you.","Before turning things over to Susan for a fuller discussion of our results, a few words about what we experienced in the fourth quarter and our future business prospects. In our last conference call in August, we noted that our third quarter performance was impacted by manufacturing inefficiencies, which particularly affected the production of combines. At the time, our then CFO, Jim Field, said we expected these issues to be largely behind us by the end of the fiscal year. I\u2019m pleased to say that\u2019s exactly what happened. Our factories have done a good job of catching up with demand and are running quite well.","In addition, John Deere has completed its best ever fourth quarter and best ever full-year in terms of both sales and earnings. We are pleased with our record results in 2012. As we all know, the world faces some big economic challenges today ranging from the U.S. fiscal cliff possibilities to euro debt crisis and the slowdown in emerging market economies. Today\u2019s economic uncertainties are real and troubling and John Deere is taking serious precautions in response.","However, we don\u2019t see these issues having a lasting impact on the powerful tailwinds that we believe will drive demand for agriculture and construction equipment well into the future. In fact, we couldn\u2019t agree more with our CEO, Sam Allen\u2019s comments in today\u2019s earnings announcement that we have great confidence in Deere\u2019s prospects and in our ability to deliver value to investors in the future. Susan?","Susan Karlix","Thank you, Raj. Now let\u2019s take a look at the fourth quarter in detail beginning on slide 3. Net sales and revenues were up 14% to $9.8 billion in the quarter. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $688 million.","On slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were $9 billion, up 14% quarter-over-quarter, included is an unfavorable impact from currency translation of about three points, price realization in the quarter was positive by four points.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let\u2019s start with ag and turf on slide 5. Sales were up 16% in the quarter. Operating profit was $931 million. There is one item that affected operating profit I\u2019d like to touch on. As mentioned in the press release issued this morning and noted on this slide, the division recorded a small write-down, approximately $33 million pre-tax, relating to our water business. This write-down reflects the near-term actions we have taken to integrate water into the A&T division\u2019s business and distribution channel. John Deere Water continues to be a long-term strategic opportunity for the company.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let\u2019s look at some of the fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. commodity price estimates that underlie our financial forecast. Corn, soybean and wheat prices are reflective of the weather-driven events that affected the growing season and are supportive of equipment sales. Prices for cotton continue to fall, as stock levels globally are about 65% higher than two years ago.","Slide 7 highlights cash receipts. Driven by strong crop prices, 2012 forecasted cash receipts of $388 billion is a record level. In 2013, strong crop prices are expected to continue and livestock receipts are forecasted to increase, spurring 2013 cash receipts even higher. As a reminder, in our modeling, current and prior-year cash receipts are the primary driver of equipment purchases in the U.S. market. With cash receipts at record levels, this bodes well for future farm prospects.","Our economic outlook for the EU27 is on slide 8. The investment mood remains positive due to high commodity prices and corresponding strong income levels. However, the overall economic situation continues to weigh on farmer sentiment as wet weather accounted for a poor U.K. harvest and inadequate rainfall hampered the fall\/winter crop planting in the Southeast EU.","On slide 9, you\u2019ll see the economic fundamentals outlined for a few of our other targeted growth markets.","Slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production in Brazil. This is a good proxy for the health of agribusiness. It encompasses over 20 different crops and has a high correlation to tractor sales over time. With forecasts for an increase in acres planted, higher yields and sustained high crop prices, the 2013 value of ag production in Brazil is expected to increase about 9% over the 2012 level.","Our 2013 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on slide 11. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be about flat in relation to the strong levels of 2012. We continue to see strength in demand especially for high horsepower tractors but our outlook is tempered by the drought-related effects on the livestock and dairy sectors. The EU27 industry outlook is flat to down 5% from the attractive levels of 2012. Our 2013 industry outlook in the CIS countries is modestly higher on the heels of strong commodity prices. Industry sales of tractors and combines in South America are expected to be up about 10% in 2013. With strong commodity prices forecast call for an increase in planted acres resulting in higher yields.","In addition, current government programs in Brazil support higher amounts of financing and lower interest rates, which will benefit the industry in our fiscal 2013. In Asia, we expect little change in 2013 compared with 2012. Soft economic conditions continue in both India and China. As well, high interest rates and the impact on crop yields from the delayed monsoon bear caution in India. The uncertainty over subsidy policy framework under the new Chinese government is also a factor in our outlook.","Turning to another product category, we expect industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be up about 5% in 2013, reflecting some improvement in the U.S. economy. We expect to outperform the industry with the launch of new turf and utility products especially new utility vehicles and commercial and residential mowers.","Putting this all together on slide 12, fiscal year 2013 Deere sales of worldwide ag and turf equipment are forecast to be up about 4%. 2013 operating margin for the ag and turf division is forecast at about 15%.","Before moving to C&F, let\u2019s touch on our early order programs. The combine early order program began in August with sales being allocated by quarter this year. Orders for combines are progressing nicely with all production sold out for quarters one and two. Dealers began placing orders for third quarter production earlier this month. In aggregate, the other seasonal programs for planters, sprayers, drills, air seeding and tillage are all up double-digits. Of note, sprayer production is almost full, even with additional capacity available this year. Our 2013 outlook is supported by this promising early order activity.","Let\u2019s focus now on construction and forestry on slide 13. Net sales were up 7% in the quarter. Operating profit was $120 million, an increase of 38%. For the quarter, C&F incremental margin was about 31%, a noticeable improvement over the 8% incremental margin realized in the fourth quarter of 2011. Price realization and higher shipment volumes contributed to the results.","On slide 14, looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, keep in mind, these Global Insight projections assume a rational resolution to the so-called fiscal cliff and expiration of the payroll tax cuts. Even as the housing sector slowly recovers and consumer confidence is up, overall economic growth continues at a slow pace.","Deere\u2019s C&F business continues to benefit from sales to independent rental companies and the energy and material handling sectors. As well, Deere dealers continue to see strength in the rental and used-equipment markets.","Fiscal 2013 net sales in construction and forestry are forecast to be up about 8%. Global forestry markets are expected to be flat in 2013 as weakness in Europe is being offset by improvement in the United States. C&F full-year operating margin is projected to be about 8%, a slight improvement over 2012. Investments in growth are the largest factor underlying C&F operating margin.","The two new factories going up in Brazil, and another in China, add additional research and development costs and selling, administrative and general expenses. We expect such growth-related expenses and costs, with little to no revenue from the new factories, to run through 2013 and well into 2014. These factories position us well for the future as Brazil is one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing construction equipment markets and China is an important market long-term.","While construction and forestry\u2019s full-year 2013 outlook is stronger than 2012, its first quarter will be against a very tough compare. Recall, in the first quarter of 2012, the division had extremely high production volumes of high-horsepower machines prior to the transition to Interim Tier 4 engines.","In the first quarter of 2013, shipments will shift to more purchased products, like excavators and commercial worksite machines, so not only will mix shift away from the higher-horsepower machines, keep in mind that purchased products have no impact on absorption. Higher product costs associated with Interim Tier 4 will have an impact in the quarter, as well as the global growth expenses discussed earlier. Nonetheless, the full-year outlook is good.","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operations. Slide 15 shows the financial services provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average-owned portfolio at 31 October, 2012 was essentially zero. This reflects the excellent quality of our portfolios, as well as some allowance reductions in the U.S. construction and forestry and Brazil ag portfolios, reflecting improved market conditions. Our 2013 financial forecast contemplates the loss provision returning to a more typical level of about 26 basis points as a percentage of the average-owned portfolio. Keep in mind, the 10-year average is about 34 basis points.","Moving to slide 16, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $122 million in the fourth quarter, which is about flat with the previous year.","Before moving to receivables and inventory, let\u2019s touch on two items in financial services quarterly results that may warrant further explanation. One is the higher reserves for crop insurance claims. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we accrued an underwriting gain on our crop insurance premium. The opposite happened in the fourth quarter of 2012, we accrued an underwriting loss. $25 million was the amount recognized in fiscal year 2012 for the drought, the majority of which was recorded in the third quarter.","The second item is the higher provision for credit losses. In the fourth quarter of 2011, reductions were taken on the allowance for doubtful receivables, whereas there were no similar reductions made in the fourth quarter of 2012. It is important to note as we discussed on slide 15, the provision as a percent of the total average-owned portfolio was essentially zero in the fourth quarter of 2012, reflecting the excellent quality of our portfolios. Looking ahead, we are projecting worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company of about $500 million in 2013.","Slide 17 outlines receivables and inventory. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventory ended the year up about $1.3 billion. This was in line with our forecast and provides further evidence that our third quarter execution issues have been resolved. We expect to end 2013 with ag and turf receivables and inventory nearly flat with 2012 levels. C&F will be up about $175 million due to expected further recovery in the sector.","Before moving on, it is important to note that in fiscal 2012, over 5,000 new employees joined the John Deere team. These additions are necessary to support our growth, both domestically and internationally, and will impact cost of sales, R&D and SA&G in 2013. Since almost two-thirds of the new employees came aboard in the last three quarters of 2012, there will be a noticeable increase in expense in the first half of the year, especially in the first quarter.","As we head into the new fiscal year, we will begin providing guidance on the cost of sales as a percent of net sales as shown on slide 18. Cost of sales may be impacted by price realization, production or manufacturing costs, raw material costs, engine emission product costs, absorption and the effects of foreign currency exchange, cost of sales is expected to be approximately 74% of net sales in 2013.","For modeling purposes, keep in mind, price realization: we are forecasting about three points in 2013; Interim Tier 4 product costs that we\u2019ve talked about the last two years; on slide 17, we talked about 2013 receivables and inventory expected to be up about $200 million, a far lower increase than we had in 2012, which affects absorption; and the impact on cost of sales from the new employees discussed earlier.","Looking at R&D expense on slide 19, R&D was up about 16% in the fourth quarter and up about 17% for the full year compared to the same periods last year. In August, we provided full year 2012 R&D guidance of up about 15%. Due to the extremely short timeframe between full implementation of Interim Tier 4 and the regulatory dates for Final Tier 4, spending has been accelerated in many product areas. Our 2013 forecast calls for R&D expense to be up about 3%.","Moving now to slide 20, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up about 9% in the fourth quarter and up about 7% for the full year. SA&G expense is forecast to be up about 7% in 2013. The equipment operations tax rate was about 38% in the fourth quarter and 35% for the full year, as you can see on slide 21. The quarterly rate was impacted by updated Accounting Standards Codification 740 reserves, a lower Section 199 deduction and the goodwill impairment charge for water. For full year 2013, the effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.","On slide 22, you see our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. We are forecasting cash flow from equipment operations to be about $3.4 billion in 2013. Slide 23 outlines our use of cash priorities, which is unchanged and no doubt familiar to many of you.","Our number one priority is to manage the balance sheet, including liquidity, to support a rating that provides access to low-cost and readily available short- and long-term funding, plus Deere is strongly committed to its A rating. You may have noticed we had about $6 billion in enterprise cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet at 31 October. With all the uncertainty in the global economy, coupled with our normal heavy first quarter seasonal needs, we felt it prudent to pre-fund our first quarter requirements. Long-term, we do not plan to continue this level of pre-funding.","Our second use of cash priority is funding value-creating investments in our operations, such as the two new construction facilities in Brazil referenced earlier. A third priority is to provide for the common stock dividend which we have raised 64% since 2010. Over time, we want to consistently deliver a series of moderately increased dividends while targeting a 25% to 35% payout ratio on average.","In this regard, we are mindful of the importance of maintaining the dividend and thus not growing it beyond the point that can be comfortably sustained by our cash flow. Share repurchase is our method of deploying excess cash once the previous requirements are met and as long as such repurchase is value-enhancing. From 2004 through 2012, we have returned 60% of cash from operations to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","On slide 24, we outline our 2013 outlook for the full year and the first quarter. Our net sales forecast for the full year is up about 5% compared to 2012. This includes about three points of price realization. Our full-year 2013 net income forecast is about $3.2 billion. The first quarter forecast calls for net sales to be up about 10% compared with the first quarter of 2012. Price realization in the quarter is expected to be positive by about four points with unfavorable currency translation of approximately one point.","In closing, John Deere enters 2013 on a strong pace. We\u2019re looking for a continuation of this performance in the year ahead, thanks in large part to strength in the global farm sector. At the same time, the company is capitalizing on the positive long-term macroeconomic trends by pursuing new markets, adding productive new models of equipment and extending its competitive position throughout the world.","John Deere\u2019s plans for helping meet the world\u2019s growing need for food, shelter and infrastructure are well on track and achieving a good deal of success; all of which supports our confidence about the future and our ability to serve customers and investors over the long-term. Tony?","Tony Huegel","Thank you, Susan. We\u2019re now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. But as a reminder, in consideration of others, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow up. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question or comment comes from Andy Kaplowitz. Your line is open. And please state your company name.","Andy Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays","Good morning, guys. Barclays.","Susan Karlix","Good morning.","Tony Huegel","Hi, Andy.","Andy Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays","Could you guys talk a little bit more about the U.S. ag market \u2013 the outlook for 2013? How are tractors doing so far? I know you don\u2019t have an early order program but how are they doing, maybe some lead-times? And then I think we understand the livestock market is relatively weak, but if you\u2019ve gotten things like sprayers basically sold out and you\u2019ve got combines pretty strong, is there potential upside to a flat market, again assuming it\u2019s a strong market to begin with?","Tony Huegel","Yeah, Andy. This is Tony. And I would say that on the tractor question, our order book, as you point out, we don\u2019t have an early order program but the order book for U.S. and Canada is roughly the same type of availability as last year; but keep in mind that is with higher capacity so as you look at 8R Tractors for example, availability is out to April 2013 timeframe; again similar to last year. And then the 9RT Track Tractors would be May of 2013.","Andy Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays","So it looks pretty good. Tony, maybe I could shift gears and ask you about \u2013 so you\u2019ve decided to do new guidance in cost of sales, and I\u2019m sure you guys anticipate that we would ask you about \u2013 to break that down a little bit if you could or at least help us think about material costs and emission cost in 2013, how should we think about it, and how did it end up in 4Q?","Tony Huegel","Sure. And as we move forward in the past, as you know, we\u2019ve given specific numeric guidance. We can certainly help kind of directionally, but as we look at those costs, Susan cited really the three highest increases, emissions costs would be the greatest increase. Absorption also is impacting the year as you see a lower build in inventories and receivable. And then the various overhead spend including the portion of that employee cost, our employee adds that impact cost of sales. So those are the three main drivers in the year.","Andy Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays","But at least material costs should be pretty benign at least in the forecast for 2013?","Tony Huegel","It was not significant enough to bear mentioning, so.","Andy Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays","Got you. Okay, I\u2019ll get back in queue. Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Jamie Cook. And please state your company name.","Andrew Buscaglia \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi. This is actually Andrew Buscaglia on behalf of Jamie Cook. Thanks for taking my question.","Tony Huegel","Good Morning.","Andrew Buscaglia \u2013 Credit Suisse","So if you were to add back the $33 million goodwill charge to ag, incrementals still seem a little light at 9% or so. Can you just talk through some of the factors driving incrementals in the quarter and then how they stood relative to your expectations?","Tony Huegel","Sure.","Raj Kalathur","Andrew, now there are two items \u2013 this is Raj \u2013 there are two items that in particular you need to make note of. One is the goodwill charge, that was about $33 million for water pre-tax and $31 million after-tax, and if you include that plus the effective tax rate increases, it was almost a $70 million impact on net income that was one-time. Okay? So you got to look at both sides. And these two alone, on a one-time basis, impacted the net income by $70 million. So if you add that back to the net income, now it would\u2019ve been higher than the guidance we provided and higher than the First Call consensus estimates.","Tony Huegel","And then if you look at ag specifically, certainly the goodwill charge would\u2019ve impacted those margins but, the press release talked about increased production costs, things like Interim Tier 4 costs, manufacturing overheads as well as some profit shares that hit cost of sales different year-over-year. Interim Tier 4 cost alone in the quarter was about $105 million so a little over $100 million, and then SG&A and R&D both were up pretty considerably in the quarter.","Andrew Buscaglia \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And, then on those Interim Tier 4 costs, can you just talk about your expectations on spend for Tier 4 in 2013?","Tony Huegel","Yeah, again, as we talked about before and coming in line really with what our expectations are, certainly not going to see a year-over-year increase like we saw in 2012 but it\u2019s not an insignificant number. As you look out into 2013, you have products that converted throughout the year. So, you had a partial year of cost increase for 2012 and you\u2019ll see a full-year increase in 2013. So, they will be up and it is the number one driver of cost increase in our cost of sales. Okay, thank you.","Andrew Buscaglia \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Tony Huegel","Let\u2019s go to the next caller.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer. And, please state your company name.","Rob Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research","It\u2019s Vertical Research. And, good morning, everybody.","Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Rob Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research","Two quick ones if I can; the early order season looks like it\u2019s going great. Deere customers seem to have concerns about soil moisture \u2013 weather is hard to predict for next year \u2013 but where we\u2019re going into this year or is that a concern that\u2019s fading and it\u2019s just a regular weather uncertainty?","Tony Huegel","Sure.","Marie Ziegler","It is something that Deere is watching in the U.S. certainly, but it\u2019s way too early to make any predictions at this stage of the game. But, it is something that we\u2019re watching. Has it affected initial sales? Certainly not from the commentary on the early order programs on \u2013 ranging from combines to sprayers and even frankly what you\u2019re seeing with the tractor activity.","Rob Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research","Yes, seems like you\u2019re not overly concerned. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re willing to answer this one but can you tell us where underlying construction margins, maybe you could do it just for the U.S., or extra growth investments are trending? Obviously, you\u2019re investing a lot; you\u2019ve gained share, I think, in construction. I think the business is doing well but it\u2019s not showing up the margins and I just don\u2019t know how big a drag that is on the growth side.","Marie Ziegler","I\u2019m unable to quantify it for you or just maybe unwilling, but suffice it to say that you have seen the construction equipment division performing very well prior certainly to the recession and we have \u2013 we are delivering that kind of performance. But, there is no question that we are impacted in this division by pretty \u2013 for them, pretty significant investments, not only in growth, in Brazil and we\u2019re talking about China, but also frankly in some IT4 expenses. Now, I should be starting to say Final Tier 4 expenses. Again, the time \u2013 the lag time between the implementation of IT4 and Final Tier 4 is very compressed.","Rob Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research","Okay, I\u2019ll stop. Thank you very much.","Tony Huegel","Thank you.","Susan Karlix","Thank you, Rob.","Operator","Our next question is from Jerry Revich. And, please state your company name.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi. It\u2019s Goldman Sachs. Good morning and happy Thanksgiving.","Tony Huegel","Thanks, Jerry. Happy Thanksgiving.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","You\u2019ve had strong retail sales for tractors in Europe over the past couple of months. Can you talk about if that\u2019s driven by your regional mix or new product lineup and whether you expect the tailwinds for Deere versus the industry to continue as you look into the early part of 2013?","Marie Ziegler","There are a number of factors at play in Europe, including the very significant product line expansions that you saw when you were in Lisbon a year and a half ago. We\u2019ve also made strides in strengthening our distribution capabilities in the market and we think that\u2019s starting to pay some nice dividends.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thanks. And, just to circle up on the Interim Tier 4 discussion, Tony, what\u2019s the magnitude of increase in 2013 versus 2012, if you could quantify that for us? It\u2019s nice to hear that the combine production issues have been addressed, but certainly your guidance is looking for 4% net income growth on 5% sales growth, and I\u2019m just wondering if you could just flesh out for us the Interim Tier 4 headwinds and the overhead head count headwinds that Susan alluded to in her remarks.","Marie Ziegler","This is Marie. I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s over $200-million impact on the IT4 for the cost.","Raj Kalathur","I think this is a question that\u2019ll come up often so let me address the cost of sales items.","Marie Ziegler","Yes.","Raj Kalathur","So, if you look at the \u2013 item-by-item, let me provide some qualitative view for each one of these. Price realization, of course, impacts the cost of sales as a percent of net sales; that\u2019s up 3%. It\u2019s already set. Volume is going to be up for 2013 about 2 points. Manufacturing inefficiencies in 2012 that we had, you should not see in 2013. Now, material we said is not significant either way. In terms of IT4 material, it\u2019s like Marie just said; it\u2019s not as high as last year. I would say it\u2019s about 60% of what we had last year. Depreciation is going to be higher and overhead expenses, as you can imagine, the 5,000 additional people and that\u2019s going to impact cost of sales, SG&A, and also R&D. So, to that extent that\u2019s going to be higher as well.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much.","Tony Huegel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ann Duignan. Please state your company name.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi. Good morning, guys. JP Morgan.","Marie Ziegler","Good morning.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi. Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 what I\u2019m worrying about here is price increases of 3%, is that enough to more than offset the higher cost of Tier 4? Or, are we looking at structurally lower margins going forward? The margin this quarter in ag and turf should have been higher in our view given the number of combines you were intending to ship out. So, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what\u2019s cyclical and if there\u2019s anything secular.","Tony Huegel","Sure. If you look at where we ended the year, pretty much in line with what we were saying from a price perspective. For the ag and turf division, we had \u2013 we were about 90% of the Interim Tier 4 costs were covered \u2013 or recovered through 2012. C&F, as expected again, a little lower than that, about 75%. So, certainly with the price realization, we\u2019re looking at next year would expect to get much further along the line on that.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","What does that mean, Tony, much further...?","Tony Huegel","Well, if you look....","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re going to get to 100%.","Tony Huegel","If you look at the 3% \u2013 I don\u2019t know exactly at 100%. Certainly, ag and turf is already at 90%. So, I think it\u2019s fair to assume you\u2019re going to get to the 100% there. And, we\u2019re looking at these on a product-by-product basis. So, as we\u2019ve talked about with the smaller ag equipment, it\u2019s harder to recover that cost; it\u2019s a higher percent of the cost of the equipment on a product that is more price sensitive. So \u2013 versus large Ag which is where construction has similar challenges as well. So, certainly, if you look at the 3% price realization versus the cost increase in just the year, it more than covered.","Raj Kalathur","Hey, Ann, this is Raj. Now, you do \u2013 you did, I\u2019m assuming, notice that the operating margins go up in 2013 compared to 2012. Now, the other thing, if you look at the incremental margins, of course they are better in 2013 compared to 2012; it\u2019s improving. And, if you were to calculate the net income incrementals that would be about 6.6% for 2012, goes up about 2 points \u2013 roughly 2 points for 2013. So, the margins are actually getting better from 2012 to 2013.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. And, then just circling back, if we look at SG&A up 7% this year, up another 7% next year that\u2019s, what, three times the rate of inflation. Are you using any kind of marketing or financing programs out there to support sales?","Marie Ziegler","So, Ann, let me just maybe set the table here and go back to net sales as a \u2013 and the change in net sales versus the change in our SG&A because I think that might help calibrate things. In 2010 \u2013 I\u2019m going to go back three years \u2013 our net sales were up 14%, SG&A was up 10%. In 2011, we were up 25% for net sales, SG&A only up 12%.","Net sales in 2012, as you know we just reported, up 14%, SG&A up 7%. So, there is a little bit of catch-up, if you will, from some spend required to support the infrastructure, if you will, of these higher sales in the form primarily of people. So, we think that while we are very mindful of our expenses, and I can assure you as a member of the CFO staff we\u2019re very mindful of our expenses, we are actually exhibiting good control relative to the types of growth that we have not only delivered, but what we have envisioned for the future.","Raj Kalathur","And, if I can add to what Marie said, Ann; now the 2012 versus 2011, 14% to 7% that Marie mentioned, if you look at the quarter four, okay, quarter four of 2011 our SG&A was about $769 million, okay? That\u2019s a 9.5% increase above the quarter four 2012 so that\u2019s fine. Now, if you look at the guidance we had going into July \u2013 August guidance going into the fourth quarter, we actually did better than the guidance we provided to you at that point. So, I think the guidance we provided was about $880 million, and our quarter four actual SG&A was $842 million.","Tony Huegel","And, Ann, this is Tony. The other thing I would add there is I think your question focused in on potential incentive programs in the market. And, if you look at our price realization both in 2012 and again in 2013 with 4 points and then another 3 points that would be pretty hard to do with incentive programs in the market.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","So, your incentive programs, if they were financing, would show up in pricing or would they show up in SG&A?","Tony Huegel","They would show up in the pricing, yes, so \u2013 okay? Thank you.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Ashish Gupta. And, please state your company name.","Ashish Gupta \u2013 CLSA","Hi. Good morning. CLSA.","Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Marie Ziegler","Good morning.","Ashish Gupta \u2013 CLSA","Good morning. Can you quantify the impact on operating profit from the combine issues? And, I think you had had an issue in the first quarter, third quarter, and then fourth quarter as well.","Tony Huegel","We talked about in the third quarter some costs from the execution issues and that was part of the spend increase that we spoke to last quarter but I think maybe what you\u2019re getting at is, certainly from a shipping pattern perspective, we had some impact from the combines, much lower shipments than normal in the first part of the year, especially in the first quarter, and then picking up in the back half of the year. And, again, of course that\u2019s impacted because of the IT4 transition.","Marie Ziegler","That was on plan. It was the third quarter that wasn\u2019t.","Ashish Gupta \u2013 CLSA","Okay.","Raj Kalathur","And, there was really no impact from any manufacturing inefficiency issues for combines in Q4, okay?","Ashish Gupta \u2013 CLSA","Okay.","Raj Kalathur","So, all of that was in Q3 and we said that will be behind us and it is behind us.","Ashish Gupta \u2013 CLSA","Great. And, then I know you mentioned that your lead times for tractors are looking similar to last year but with the added capacity. I was just wondering could you remind us the year-over-year increases in capacity for the products like sprayers and tractors where you\u2019ve added on.","Tony Huegel","Well, keep in mind, it\u2019s hard to \u2013 we certainly have talked about within Waterloo the expand of capacity but as you know that\u2019s a facility that\u2019s really for global production on the 7000, 8000, and 9000 series tractors. So, it\u2019s hard to distinguish how much of that capacity is specifically related to the U.S. and Canada production. So \u2013 we talked about in the past for Waterloo specifically, by the end of 2012, we would add 15% capacity there. And, then again we made another announcement in March of last year for an additional 10% capacity that is coming here \u2013 coming through 2013 so \u2013 or will be in place in \u2013 I think mid-2013 is what we had indicated that capacity would be in place. So, again, I wouldn\u2019t take that to mean that you\u2019ve got a full 10% capacity increase in Waterloo tractors for the U.S. and Canada market but we do, in fact, in 2012 have higher capacity for that market. Okay?","Ashish Gupta \u2013 CLSA","Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Tony Huegel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Steve Volkmann. Your line is open. And, please state your company name.","Steve Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies","Hi. Good morning, everybody. It\u2019s Jefferies.","Marie Ziegler","Good morning.","Raj Kalathur","Good morning.","Steve Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies","My question is about the comment that Susan made on wanting to pre-fund the first quarter and having extra cash on the balance sheet and maybe not needing to do that going forward. So, I\u2019m trying to figure out what would be a more normal level of cash. And, I\u2019ll ask my related follow-up which is, have you changed your view of what dividends should be given potential changes in taxation? And, also you talk about mid-cycle earnings which raises the question \u2013 I think in the past you\u2019ve said things about where you think we are versus mid-cycle in your various businesses. So, maybe you can help us with that too.","Marie Ziegler","Wow! Okay, first of all, we would view with our global growth the operating cash requirements that you would see at \u2013 typically at a yearend would be somewhere in the $4 billion to $5 billion range and that really reflects the changing nature of the business and that\u2019s basically where we are today. So, we\u2019ve got about $1 billion to $1.5 billion extra in pre-funding. Depending on how market conditions play out, as we move through the end of the year and we see hopefully a very successful resolution to this fiscal cliff, we won\u2019t feel it necessary to have that level of pre-funding. So that, I think, takes care of your first question.","Steve Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you.","Marie Ziegler","Regarding the dividend, the dividend really is the purview of the Board, and so I will not be able to make a comment on the dividend. And, your third question would \u2013 we are not providing a prescriptive or point-blank number on where we are. It\u2019s fair to say that the ag markets in the U.S. are very strong, not as strong in markets outside, and construction is still in, I\u2019ll say, a recovery mode, although they\u2019re getting closer to a more typical cycle. So, three questions for you, Steve.","Steve Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies","But, I asked them quickly. Thank you very much.","Marie Ziegler","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Raso. And, please state your company name.","David Raso \u2013 ISI","ISI. I\u2019m just making sure I understand the moving parts on the margin guidance for next year. Can you clarify the IT4 cost? Somebody mentioned up $200 million, then another mention was but that\u2019s only 60% of the cost we had in 2012. Is that the right way to look at it? It\u2019s basically the rough numbers would be it was $300 million or so in 2012 but it\u2019s only $200 million in 2013 so it\u2019s a $100-million benefit year-over-year?","Tony Huegel","No. Keep in mind, when we talk about incremental cost, in 2012 the total costs were about $485 million higher year-over-year, okay? When we talk about the impact on cost of sales being up again in 2014 that\u2019s in addition to the $485 million so it\u2019s additive. So if you look back further, 2011 was $155 million, we had another $485 million last year, and then we\u2019re adding on top of that yet again this year.","David Raso \u2013 ISI","Okay. So, to frame the positives and negatives for year-over-year margin in ag, this will be the question, right? The idea is you\u2019re implying incremental margins next year of 28% for ag and turf. And, if you adjust for some of the goodwill in this quarter, call it 25%, 26%, so it\u2019s still a pretty healthy number. But, your costs are up for Interim Tier 4, but the price for ag alone, you said 3% for the whole company. Is ag and turf a little bit beyond that? You\u2019re saying it\u2019s a little higher, 3.5%....","Tony Huegel","We don\u2019t guide on specific divisions. Certainly, both divisions are contributing.","David Raso \u2013 ISI","Okay. So, if we just put the positives and negatives, right, the negatives are higher costs, the positive is you get more price. The overhead absorption, receivables and inventories went up over $1 billion for ag and turf in 2012. This next year, it\u2019s obviously a lot more modest, barely up at all. So, a negative would be the overhead absorption?","Tony Huegel","Correct.","David Raso \u2013 ISI","You have some costs as well with the employees. But, for the mix \u2013 and we can debate if the sales guidance is conservative now off the order book, but I\u2019m just trying to take it at face value. The mix, the U.S. comments have been relatively positive. South America, I would argue, is a decent margin geography for you in ag when it comes to margins. Would you describe the mix from the order book, the geography, however you want to look at it, is the mix going into 2013 for ag and turf, would you view that as positive for margins?","Marie Ziegler","When we talk \u2013 when we think about that ourselves, we tend to look at products not geographies, and you have products in some geographies that have very attractive yields and some that don\u2019t. And so, it\u2019s really more product centric. With that, Tony didn\u2019t mention it as one of the driving factors so, David, we don\u2019t have a comment on that.","David Raso \u2013 ISI","Okay. All right, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Marie Ziegler","Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Weber. And, please state your company name.","Adam Nielsen \u2013 RBC Capital","Hi. It\u2019s Adam Nielsen, on for Seth. How are you? Thanks.","Tony Huegel","Good. How are you?","Adam Nielsen \u2013 RBC Capital","Good, thanks. I\u2019m just wondering if you could speak a bit about the competitive environment in Brazil. It looks like you pick up some share in tractors since \u2013 into the fall. So, are you able to hold pricing pretty stable there in defense of margins? Or, is it getting a little more competitive?","Tony Huegel","Yeah. Certainly, again as you look at our price realization for the year, I think that\u2019s indicative of our ability to hold that price so.","Adam Nielsen \u2013 RBC Capital","Okay. And, then on the \u2013 along similar lines....","Tony Huegel","Keep in mind on those tractors \u2013 on large tractors, most of those \u2013 those are ordered well in advance of when we\u2019re actually shipping and retailing those. So that\u2019s also impacting it.","Marie Ziegler","And for the sake of those who may not be as familiar with our Brazilian operations, we have made significant investments down there in factory, capacity. We have had a very significant broadening of our tractor line but frankly of many product lines. Two years ago, approximately we launched 50 new products, many of which were in categories that we were not yet competing. We also have a very good dealer organization. We\u2019ve been growing their presence and their footprint in Brazil as well and we\u2019re benefiting from that.","Raj Kalathur","This is Raj. So, overall, our tractor portfolio in Brazil has been strengthening, our dealer channel has been strengthening, and our price realization has been good, okay? So, it\u2019s a positive story for us so far, okay?","Adam Nielsen \u2013 RBC Capital","Great. And, along those same lines, the cost drag next year \u2013 in 2013 relative to this year, can you frame that for us? I know China will be a little later but can you frame those for the new capacity adds?","Marie Ziegler","In terms of \u2013 no. Actually, the \u2013 it would be implied or included in the kinds of guidance that we\u2019ve already provided. But, we\u2019re not going to be able to comment specifically on the factory. Thank you.","Adam Nielsen \u2013 RBC Capital","Okay. Thanks.","Tony Huegel","Next caller.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Robert McCarthy. And, please state your company name.","Rob McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","It\u2019s Robert W. Baird. Good morning, everybody.","Marie Ziegler","Good morning.","Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Raj Kalathur","Good morning.","Rob McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Can I first just get a definitional clarification? You\u2019re talking about fiscal 2013 COGS being 74% of what exactly? Is it net sales for the equipment operations or net sales and revenue for the equipment operations?","Tony Huegel","Net sales of the equipment operations.","Rob McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Net sales of the equipment operations, okay.","Tony Huegel","Yeah, so.","Rob McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","So, excluding finance and interest income and other income that are reported....","Tony Huegel","Right. Yeah, as typical when we are providing our guidance, it would be on the equipment operations with financial services on the equity basis.","Rob McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","I just wanted to make absolutely sure.","Tony Huegel","Absolutely.","Rob McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","And, in the release of course there are comments about strength in \u2013 or expected continued strength in large equipment in the U.S. and Canadian market offsetting pressure on U.S. and livestock and dairy sectors. That does imply improved mix in the U.S. and Canada, doesn\u2019t it?","Marie Ziegler","Again, I think we\u2019ve got a number of factors at play. If mix was a significant factor up or down, we would have cited it when we were going through the factors to think about for next year.","Rob McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. So, it\u2019s an immaterial consideration, okay. So, the other question I had was Mr. Allen was on television a couple of days ago, talking about the uncertain current macro environment and made comments about Deere having specifically slowed or deferred certain investments. How do I think about your \u2013 the guidance that you\u2019re issuing today for expense levels and CapEx, unchanged full-year CapEx, in light of those comments? Does it suggest that the CapEx budget has some upside if we see a quick resolution to fiscal cliff issues, for example? Can you help us here?","Raj Kalathur","Yeah. Robert, this is Raj.","Rob McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Hi.","Raj Kalathur","Now, our forecast essentially for CapEx and other expenses indicate caution based on the economic uncertainties, okay? Now, we have asked the divisions \u2013 we have approved the capital expenditures and expenses but asked our units to delay as much of it as practical into January, okay? Now, the current plans of course reflect our assessment of the probabilities of different economic outcome. And, as the economic scenarios become clearer, we may modify our plans, right? So, we will pull levers and cut down in investments if the scenario worsens, and we may accelerate our plans as prudent if the economic scenario turns positive. So, you should see that as just a pragmatic, sensible approach to both CapEx and expenses.","Rob McCarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Yeah, I got it. Okay, thank you very much.","Tony Huegel","Thanks, Rob. Okay, next caller.","Operator","And, are you ready for the next question?","Tony Huegel","Yes, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vance Edelson. And, please state your company name.","Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning. It\u2019s Morgan Stanley. You mentioned a few months ago that you might need to extend the balance sheet a bit in Europe to facilitate sales given the credit conditions. Any update on that? Would you say that\u2019s an upward or downward trend at this point?","Marie Ziegler","I think what we were referring to there is that we\u2019re actually looking at some partnerships with some banks to help us facilitate financing in various markets, and we have or are close to having in some markets some new agreements that\u2019ll help us in countries in Europe and in the former Soviet Union where we \u2013 or the East Bloc would be better to say where we haven\u2019t had a presence. But, I don\u2019t have anything to publicly announce on this call.","Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And, just a quick follow-up on something you recently mentioned. I think you said you\u2019re getting closer to recovery mode on the construction side, and overall, you\u2019re calling for modest improvement in the U.S. Is that a bit conservative even with the sluggish economic growth that you cite, just given the possibility of bouncing off the bottom now that there actually are some green shoots? Could you elaborate a little on what leads to the forecast for modest improvement?","Tony Huegel","On construction and forestry? Again, we\u2019re really \u2013 it\u2019s a similar story to what we saw last year. We\u2019re continuing to see strength in the rental channel, energy related, those sorts of things is what\u2019s drive \u2013 continuing to drive that modest improvement for that particular division.","Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah, okay. Thank you.","Tony Huegel","All right? Okay, thank you. Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten. And, please state your company name.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Longbow Securities. Good morning, everyone.","Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Marie Ziegler","Good morning.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Okay. Can I get one clarification? In the back of your release, you have pension and OPEB expenses going up $70 million. You didn\u2019t cite it as an expense as it is done. Is that correct? Is it about a $0.02 impact for the higher pension expenses because you didn\u2019t get as much in 2012?","Marie Ziegler","Well that\u2019s funding.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","No, it says expense.","Marie Ziegler","No, it is expense; sorry.","Tony Huegel","Yeah, it is up \u2013 it will be up about $70 million; that\u2019s on an enterprise basis. Of course, most of that is equipment operations.","Marie Ziegler","Right.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","And so, there is an impact that should have been \u2013 that we would notice in the numbers? Can we...?","Marie Ziegler","That\u2019s correct.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","And....","Tony Huegel","And that would be \u2013 Eli, that\u2019s about two \u2013 roughly, it\u2019s about two-thirds cost of sales and the rest SA&G.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","And, you\u2019ve showed there \u2013 that as a cost. You gave us also the first quarter is going to be up 10%. Can you give us \u2013 and the rest of the year very modest based on your forecast. Can you (inaudible) \u2013 that 10% gain, is that just normal seasonality, an easy comparison in combines because there is some questions about the depreciation expense benefit expiring at the end of the year? So, whether or not people are trying to actually to get equipment, are you seeing any of that? Alternatively, the insurance checks seem to be coming later and probably not until January and February. So, do you have any of that factored in? Give us some help on how the insurance checks are playing out and the depreciating expense and how it affects the first quarter and the later quarters?","Tony Huegel","Yeah. Certainly, I think \u2013 as you said in part of that, I think it\u2019s more of a reflection of last year and the lower sales of combines. Keep in mind, in terms of the....","Marie Ziegler","Production.","Tony Huegel","The production, right, of combines. But, last year \u2013 or in terms of the tax incentive, keep in mind, they have to take possession by that \u2013 by the end of the year and with the order books in the position that we have them in, they would have needed to have those ordered well in advance in order to take advantage of any of that tax incentive. The other thing to keep in mind, it\u2019s 50% this year; in 2011, it was 100%. So, it would really go down to the more traditional. As you look out into 2013, it goes down to the five-year depreciation so 20%. So, it\u2019s not as large of a step function from 2012 to 2013 as it was from 2011 to 2012.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","And, the insurance check impact? That\u2019s probably the most significant one that people worry about because they\u2019re not going to get the checks until January and February, at least according to most....","Tony Huegel","Yeah, I think our expectation for credit would be that by the end of the year about 70% of our expected claims will be paid by then.","Raj Kalathur","By the end of calendar year.","Tony Huegel","By the end of calendar year, yeah; sorry.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Yeah, I was more \u2013 not so much worried about claims on you, but I was worried \u2013 I was asking more on the impact of farmer purchases and timing of it and whether that....","Tony Huegel","Well that\u2019s \u2013 but that\u2019s our \u2013 checks from our John Deere insurance. It\u2019s hard to know what other insurance companies are doing, but if you look at just our business, for our customers 70% of the expected payments will be made by the end of the calendar year.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","And, is there \u2013 is there any place that you have excess inventory or issues? Particularly in construction equipment, we now see a big widespread inventory liquidation going on because a lot of rental channels are filled (inaudible). Are we seeing any shutdowns or any place where inventories are out of whack in any part of the product line?","Tony Huegel","Out in the field inventory, no.","Marie Ziegler","For construction, heck, by virtue of the fact that we\u2019re actually projecting inventories will end next year up a bit, we\u2019re in very good shape. And, again on our \u2013 on the ag side, while there\u2019s always little pockets here and there, it\u2019s pretty de minimis relative to the size of the business.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","And, no excess combine used inventories or any issues?","Marie Ziegler","We\u2019re very comfortable with levels across the board.","Raj Kalathur","Thanks, Eli.","Tony Huegel","Okay. Thanks, Eli. And, with that, we thank you for your participation in the call. As always, we\u2019ll be available the rest of the day to answer any additional questions you may have.

We're seeing higher overall demand for our products with farm machinery sales in South America experiencing strong gains and construction equipment sales rising sharply. The Company's performance is also being helped by an advanced product portfolio and the continuing impact of applicable cost structure and lien asset base.","Now, let's take a closer look at our third quarter results, beginning on slide three; net sales and revenues were up 16% to $7.8 billion; net income attributable to Deere & Company was $642 million; EPS was $1.97 in the quarter. On slide four, total worldwide Equipment Operations net sales were up 17% to $6.8 billion; price realization in the quarter was favorable by 1 point; currency translation did not have a material impact in the quarter.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Ag & Turf on slide five. Net sales were up 13% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison due to higher shipment volumes and price realization, partially offset by higher warranty cost. All regions contributed to the sales increase. Operating profit was $685 million, up 20% from 571 million last year. This was a result of higher shipment volumes and price realization, partially offset by increased production costs, higher warranty cost and higher selling, administrative and general expenses.","The quarter also benefited from a gain on the sale of Deere\u2019s remaining interest in SiteOne Landscape Supply, Inc., which contributed just below 2 points of operating margin. For more details regarding the transaction, please see the notes in today's earnings release. Operating margins were 12.8% for the quarter. In the quarter-over-quarter comparison, the SiteOne impacted minimal as both periods benefitted from SiteOne sale.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, I'll now turn the call over to Dr. J. B. Penn for commentary on the global Ag economy. J. B.?","J. B. Penn","Thanks, Josh. Good morning, everyone. I will try to provide a very brief high level view of how we\u2019re sizing up the global agricultural economy at the moment; a few supporting slides are included in the presentation. Here we are in mid-August experiencing yet another good growing season, following four previous seasons of near ideal weather for global agriculture.","Food demand remains very robust, and with the forecast for another abundant crop, the fundamental outlook basically is for more of the same, a continuation into the future of the current market condition. Nevertheless, it is highly notable that the global grain supply use balance is tightening somewhat with consumption outpacing production for the first time since 2012, suggesting that the commodity markets could be increasingly sensitive, going forward. Likewise, protein markets, such as Dairy, are also now more in balance globally with prices and farmer incomes improving from recent seasons.","We now have enough experience following the record high 2012 prices to suggest that recent commodity price trading ranges can now be expected for the future, moving upside with any significant adverse weather events, but with minimal downside risk. New floors -- new price floors have been established by shift in the own farm cost structure and the market fundamentals.","Now, the USDA August world agriculture supply-demand estimates reported last week, clarified the U.S. crop situation considerably. It reaffirm that overall demand remains very strong, forecasting another increase in global grain consumption for the 22nd consecutive year. While 2017 is not as weather perfect as the previous four years, it still is proving to be quite good worldwide. The [Wazi] report also forecast ample supplies of corn and soybean from large acreages. Even so, as shown on the chart on slide eight, we see the global supply use ratio for all grains, excluding China, forecast to fall significantly, approaching 15%, which would imply a global 59 day supply versus the lowest ever recorded of 52 days.","Now, when we look at farmer margins in the U.S., we see crop farmers\u2019 build-out positive margins from the marketplace supplemented by the government program benefits. Notably, a turnaround in farm income is forecast for calendar 2017, the first increase since the peak in 2013. Our experience is suggesting that traditional farmer capital purchase patters are returning; now that used equipment inventories are approaching more traditional levels. The agricultural credit situation still is relatively good across the sector; loan volume has increased to be sure; we see that in the John Deere financial revolving credit line; but most repayment and creditworthiness indicators and the John Deere financial portfolio loan loss experience, still are well within the normal balance.","Another recent USDA report showed average U.S. farm real estate values rose 2.3% in 2017 after a slight decline in 2016, which was only the second decline in the past three decades. Overall, crop land value however remains flat, as shown on slide 10, but with a slightly mixed picture across the major farming regions; that is prices declined 16% in the corn-belt but belter prices rose 3%. Cash rents remains sticky, lagging changes in land prices; crop land cash rent, shown in slide 11, declined in 2016 from 2015 but remained unchanged in 2017; rental rate changes were mix in major agricultural states, slightly down in some but notably higher in others. The USDA data suggests that with current commodity price ranges, farmers for the most part, are still willing to pay the current rental rates.","Now, looking beyond North America. The agricultural economies in Latin America continue to improve again this year with record corn and soybean production and exports forecast for the season. Despite considerable political turmoil, our agriculture is increasingly robust, especially in Brazil and Argentina, with the rest of Latin American generally improved as well. Brazil is forecast to report the highest farm income in 30 years.","The Black Sea region continues its expansion, experiencing even larger crops and export quantities along with improved farm economics. Grain exports will be record large in both Russia and Ukraine, and Russia now is a contender for number one wheat exporter, displacing both the U.S. and Canada. Elsewhere in the world, the agricultural economies are mostly stable with few significant events or developments. Marginal improvements continue to be evident in Europe, however.","And now to summarize this overall view, let me note that geopolitical turmoil and political uncertainty continues to be the business backdrop as they have been all through the past year. And this always has the potential to be very disruptive to global food and agriculture market, thus than ever present short-term downside risk. But overall, the global agricultural economy this year is an improvement over last year and next year is expected to be marginally better yet again. Weather still is the market wild card, the driver of any significant upside price movement. Global food and agricultural trade still growing despite sluggish GDP growth, but the prospects are better for 2018 and 2019.","New IMF forecast boost global GDP growth to 3.6% in '18 and 3.7% in '19 compared with 3.5% forecast for this year; all of these increases boding well for continued strength in income growth and food demand. And I will end with a reminder that the long term global tailwinds still are with us; food trends in population and urbanization growth, along with continued income growth and dietary improvements, still characterize the global agriculture business backdrop.","Now, back to you Josh.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks J. B. Turning to our 2017 Ag & Turf industry outlook on slide 12, which are largely unchanged from last quarter. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecasted to be down about 5% with the effect felt in both large and small models of equipment. There has been a lot of conversations regarding the trend in the retail sales in U.S. and Canada for tractors of 100 horsepower and above.","It's important to note that in the third quarter, over 80% of Deere sales in this category were below 220 horsepower. As noted previously, it does appear the large ag market is stabilizing. Signs supporting the stabilization include; a considerably lower rate of industry sales decline in 2017 versus the past two years; a used equipment environment that is supportive of sales; and, increased demand for spring seasonal products. This is particularly true for what we\u2019re seeing in planters and sprayers in the first phase of our early order program for 2018 with orders up strongly.","EU28 industry outlook is flat to down 5% in 2017. Sentiment is improving in the region due to higher dairy and solid livestock margins. Dairy and livestock make up about half of farm incomes in the EU28. However, low crop prices and edible farm incomes continue to weigh on the market. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be up about 20% in 2017. In Brazil, the transition to the FINAME plan for 2017-2018 has gone smoothly.","The government is ongoing committed agriculture, coupled with strong margins are continuing to improve farmer confidence. Sentiment and demand Argentina remains strong as well. Shifting to Asia, sales are expected to be flat to down slightly. Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be about flat in 2017.","Putting this all together, on slide 13, fiscal year 2017 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be up about 9% versus 2016 with currency translation contributing about 1 point. The year-over-year increase is driven by growth in our overseas markets, and is also benefiting from lower beginning filed inventories. Our Ag & Turf division operating margin is forecast to be 11.58% in 2017. The implied incremental margin for the year is about 40%. Excluding the impact of onetime items, like SiteOne and the voluntary employee separation program, incremental margins are roughly 30%.","Now, let's focus on Construction & Forestry on slide 14. Net sales were up 29% in the quarter, mainly a result of higher shipment volumes, partially offset by higher sales incentive expenses. Operating profit was $110 million in the quarter, up from $54 million last year. The increase was driven by higher shipment volumes, partially offset by higher selling, administrative and general expenses, higher sales incentive expense and increased production costs. Operating margins were 7.4%, nearly 3 points higher than in last year\u2019s third quarter.","Moving to slide 15. The economic fundamentals affecting the construction and forestry industries in North America are cause for continued optimism; GDP growth is positive; job growth continues; construction spending is up from 2016 levels; housing starts are expected to exceed 1.25 million units this year; and home inventories are near 35 year lows; construction investment is forecast to grow in 2017 by about 3%, led by rebounding oil and gas and residential activities; commercial and institutional construction continued to increase moderately; machinery rental utilization rates have improved in each of the last six months, and rental rates are beginning to gain positive traction; and, used inventories has continued to come down in the past quarter. All in all, our outlook reflect the strong order book, as well as what we've seen in the way of retail sales growth over the last six months.","Moving to our C&F outlook on slide 16. Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be up about 15% in 2017, largely driven by demand in the U.S. and Canada. The forecast for global forestry markets is down about 5% to 10%, a result of lower sales in U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 6.6% with an implied incremental margin of about 27%.","Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 17 shows the provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. The financial forecast for 2017, shown on the slide, contemplates a loss provision of about 27 basis points, slightly lower than the previous forecast. This will put the losses just above the 10-year average of 26 basis points but below the 15-year average of 34 points.","Moving to slide 18, worldwide Financial Services\u2019 net income attributable to Deere & Company was $131 million in the third quarter versus $126 million last year. The improvement was primarily due to lower operating lease losses, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and higher selling, administrative and general expense. Financial Services\u2019 2017 net income attributable to Deere & Company is forecast to be about $475 million, unchanged from the previous forecast.","Slide 19 outlines receivables and inventories. For the Company, as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter, up $867 million due to increases in both the Ag & Turf and C&F division. We expect to end 2017 with total receivables and inventories up about $950 million with increases in both of our equipment divisions. Regarding the increase in Ag & Turf, the majority comes from inventories. Increases related to receivables are driven by our overseas markets as North American receivables are down year-over-year. Currency translation had a significant impact in the overall change for the quarter and in the full year forecast.","Slide 20 shows cost of sales as a percent of net sales. Cost of sales for the third quarter was 77.1%. Our 2017 cost of sales guidance remains about 77% of net sales. When modeling 2017, keep in mind the unfavorable impacts of raw material prices, the emissions cost, incentive compensation, voluntary separation expenses and pension and overhead expense. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point, but slightly favorable sales mix and savings related to the voluntary employee separation program.","Now, let's look at some additional details. With respect to R&D on slide 21, R&D was down 1% in the third quarter and is forecast to be down about 1% for the full year. Moving to slide 22, SA&G expense for the Equipment Operations was up 12% in the third quarter with the main drivers being incentive compensation, commissions paid to dealers and acquisition related activities. Our 2017 forecast calls for SA&G expense to be up about 11%. Most of the full year change is expected to come from incentive compensation, voluntary separation expenses, commissions paid to dealers, acquisition related activities and currency exchange. Acquisition related activities are in large part related to our planned acquisition of the Wirtgen Group, which was announced earlier in the quarter.","Turning to slide 23, the Equipment Operations tax rate was 27% in the quarter due mainly to discreet items. For 2017, the full year effective tax rate is now forecast in the range of 30% to 32%. Slide 22 shows our Equipment Operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the Equipment Operations is forecast to be about $2.9 billion in 2017. The Company's financial outlook is on slide 25. Net sales for the fourth quarter are forecast to be up about 24% compared with 2016. Our full year outlook now calls for net sales to be up about 10%, which includes about 1 point of price realization and currency translation impact of about 1 point. Finally, our full year 2017 net income forecast is about $2.075 billion.","In closing, we\u2019re well on our way to complete another good year. The Company's ability to deliver consistently strong financials, as we've done throughout 2017, is proof of our success building the more durable business model. In addition, we are continuing to find ways to make our operations more efficient and profitable, while providing even more value to our growing global customer base. As a result, we\u2019re confident Deere is well positioned to continue its strong performance and longer term, to fully capitalize on the world\u2019s increasing need for advanced machinery and services well into the future.","Tony Huegel","Thank you, Josh. We're now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Raj, J. B. and I, are available for your questions. In consideration of others, though, and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. The operator will now instruct you on the following procedure.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie Cook","I guess my first question or I guess I am only allowed one question. In the ag margins, the incremental margins, if you adjust for SiteOne, disappointed in the quarter. So I\u2019ll someone else ask about the quarter. But I guess longer term, why shouldn't we have less confidence in your ability to deliver above average incremental margins in ag, or as we're looking out, or the material costs or warranty or price. I mean, should that improve longer term? And are we on track with $500 million savings, because that would also impact the margins. So just longer term your ability to deliver incremental margins in ag. Thanks.","Tony Huegel","I think certainly, especially if you look into quarter. But if you look at the full year I mean you have, as Josh mentioned in the opening comments from an incremental perspective; if you strip out those one-time items, like SiteOne from a positive side, voluntary separation, those sorts of things; you\u2019re still on the neighborhood of 30% and that was incremental for ag, and that's not with a real strong mix from a large ag perspective; there's some positive mix for our ag on the year, but most of that's coming from slight positive with parts, not so much from the completed side of things.","But you're also -- as we talked about throughout the year, we\u2019ve seen pretty significant headwinds on material costs; the higher rates than we would have anticipated certainly going into the year and what we have had anticipated around the 500 million savings; so those headwinds -- we'll see what happens with steel costs and other commodity costs if you go into 2018. Currently, our forecast would imply flattish, not the improvement we had hoped for. Last quarter, we were anticipating we receive some softening. As we go into 2018, most of the outlook today that we're looking at would stay more flattish to at least the lion share of 2018; but not headwinds year-over-year like we saw this year from an increase.","The other thing you mentioned, warranty. And I think we did talk about that in the quarter. And I think it's worth spending maybe a little bit of time, because if you look at the underlying ongoing rate of warranty claims that actually starting to come down a bit. And then talking specifically in ag, because that's the area that we\u2019ve talked about this quarter. But what's occurred in the quarter is -- and you're I think aware of it, Jamie; occasionally, we\u2019ll choose to proactively fix certain product issues that have been identified in the field; and we refer to those as product improvement programs. And it really relates to -- we have very strong focus on customer satisfaction and product quality.","And so when we identify those things, we want to make sure they got taken care off right away. In those situations, we accrue the costs for those repairs or for that program in the quarter that the program is identified or launched. And so you tend to get lumpy charges from those product improvement programs, because of an accrual upfront; we've had a few of those in the quarter; if you step back I know one of the concerns maybe around quality.","But remember, we have launched a very large number of new products in recent years, primarily related to emission requirements. And as a result of that with that higher level of new product that has entered the market, we\u2019ve seen a bit of an increase in those product improvements programs; and again, especially in the quarter. And that primarily what drove the higher warranty in the quarter. I would remind you also that we did increase our parts warranty program in earlier in the year. And so that does have a little bit of increase on the ongoing warranty rate versus what we would have seen a year ago. But the biggest issue in the quarter really was around those improvement programs, which theoretically won't repeat at least at these levels as we go into 2018.","Raj Kalathur","Jamie, this is Raj. Let me just add to what Tony talked about, and your question about margins, going forward. There is a lot of noise in this quarter and that\u2019s why we say, hey look at the full year. And then beyond that, we\u2019re just at the nascent stage in terms of cycle, especially when you think about large ag North America. So that\u2019s a mix shift better as to Tony\u2019s point, this can get better. Remember, we are still a very low percent of mid-cycle. So at these levels, these margins when it's structural enough, it's a good bet. Now $500 million above, you\u2019re on track with the $500 million and we could have been even ahead, but for the material inflation headwind, Tony talked about. So if material inflation is flat, like where it is right now fuel prices that might offer some additional help.","Now, if you remember we said direct material cost reductions of 2.5% per year is what we\u2019ve baked in with, so structural cost reduction. So we are getting that 2.5% structural direct material cost reduction pretty much. But we also said we\u2019re expecting about 0.5 of that being eaten away by FX and material inflation; this year, it's more than 0.5, even away where material inflation. So, if that changes and as we accumulate even more structural direct material cost reduction, margin should improve even further.","Now one thing I'll add is let's keep in mind that it's going to get harder to pin point the portion of the improvement coming from the structural cost reduction we talked about as things start improving and the cycle goes up. We\u2019ll have some leverage come back at. So it will be hard to pin point leverage versus structural cost reductions, but we\u2019ll try our best to talk about it.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jerry Revich","On used equipment inventories, you mentioned a couple of times that inventories have come down. Can you just flush that out a little bit more for us, how much are used equipment inventories down over the course of the cycle from the peak? And if you could share months of supply in absolute that would be helpful, and any color on combined versus large tractor as well. Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Really what I'm looking at in the numbers I pulled for late, specifically the large ag in total. So I don\u2019t have details in front of me in combines and tractor, for example. But I don\u2019t believe they\u2019d be significantly different; combines, remember we\u2019re in better shape, so I guess most of the reduction will be in tractors. But if you look at large ag in total, we would say at the end of our third quarter, we\u2019re down about 37% from the peak, which would have been in summer of 2014. Last quarter, we were down about 36% and a year ago, at this time, we were down 23%. So if you think about over that last year, we\u2019ve gone from down 23% to down 37%. So our dealers have done a great job of bringing those used inventories down.","We're continuing to focus on that. Putting that in perspective, these are the lowest levels on an absolute basis since September of 2012. So the dealers again have pulled a lot of inventory out of the system, and it really goes part the comment to both Josh and J. B. made about that being a much more supportive environment for our dealers today as they work with our customers.","Jerry Revich","And Tony, were those absolute numbers in terms of lowest levels in 2012, or is that a month of supply. Can you just help us understand the difference [multiple speakers].","Tony Huegel","That\u2019s on an absolute level.","Jerry Revich","And how\u2019s it looking months of supply?","Tony Huegel","I don\u2019t have that number in front of me. So I\u2019ll have to look that up and get back to you.","Raj Kalathur","And the other thing, Jerry, is you got to think about month of supply on a forward looking basis, it gets even better.","Operator","The next question is coming from Timothy Thein of Citi Group. Your line is open. ","Timothy Thein","The question is on product mix in North America\u2019s Ag, specifically. I'm just curious, Tony, based on what do you see in terms of your early orders, you referenced earlier and as well as the inventory increase that you're projecting in terms of the channel inventory by year end. What does that tell you at least now as you look ahead to 2018 in terms of the mix, again specifically in North America large versus small. And may be how that would compare to what you expect to realize here in FY '17?","Tony Huegel","Certainly, if you look at large versus small in the U.S. and Canada, a percent of mid-cycle; small ag wouldn\u2019t be as far down, certainly; they\u2019ve performed much better through this down turn and that\u2019s the part of the positive story that we've had. So I think there\u2019s certainly, from that perspective there\u2019s always more upside on large ag. And when you think about early order programs, that\u2019s mostly visibility in the large ag. We don\u2019t tend to get that kind of visibility on small ag. At this point, we still be relying more on some of the economic modeling and dealer feedback and so on that we\u2019ll be getting.","But on the early order program on those plants and the equipment and as well as sprayers, we're up double-digit. And I don\u2019t' want to go into the specific number simply because the number -- it is off relatively low level, those are product categories that were at the lower end of the range that large ag went to. But it's been very encouraging actually it's a bit stronger than what we would have anticipated. And so that\u2019s very positive in terms of the potential for large ag to continue the type of recovery that we\u2019ve talked about as early as last quarter.","Now, it's always caution around it at this point that was one phase of the program. But again, it does directionally point to another data point I guess that would point to a stronger year next year for large ag. We\u2019ll see as we move through the quarter and as the combine early order program kicks in, remember that just started earlier this month. So it's very premature to talk about. We\u2019ll give an update on that in fourth quarter. But again, most of those signs from customer sentiment to the orders that we\u2019re starting to see would still be viewed as positive for 2018, as it relates to large ag.","Operator","The next question is coming from Joe O'Dea of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Joe O'Dea","On the $500 million structural cost out that you targeted a year ago. Could you just talk about what current material costs due to that? And then where you think you\u2019ll be by the end of this year, and any color you can give on cadence moving through \u201918, how we should think about the split in '18 and '19?","Raj Kalathur","So I think we have said, we have about $250 million out of that $500 million in this U.S. forecast so far, and that's roughly where we are as well. In spite of the signals that can hit them, we\u2019ve had some material inflation. So if the material inflation wasn\u2019t that high even higher in terms of our overall -- meeting our overall goal of $500 million. So we are on track, which means we are on track to get to the $500 million by the end of 2018, so anything beyond the $250 million, you\u2019re going to see in the fiscal '18 numbers.","Tony Huegel","And just to clarify, remember that was $90 million in 2016 and then another $160 million in '17; so cumulatively $250 million towards by the end of this year.","Joe O'Dea","And then I think run rate in that $500 million when you exit '18, so fair to\u2026","Tony Huegel","Exactly, so you'll see the full benefit in 2019.","Joe O'Dea","If you\u2019re going to be run rating at the end of '18 that you get more than half of it next year of the remainder?","Raj Kalathur","Fair.","Tony Huegel","Yes, I think that\u2019s fair, yes.","Operator","The next question is coming from Ann Duignan of J. P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Ann Duignan","There is little to no downside risk to commodity prices from here. If we -- if Argentina\u2026","Tony Huegel","Could you start your question over, we missed the very first part of your question. It was almost as if you were on mute. So could you start over please?","Ann Duignan","Yes, sure. As far as J. B., I think in J. B.\u2019s remarks he commented that there was little to no downside risk to commodity prices from here. And I would just like to hear his thoughts on the notion that Argentina is expected to grow, or it take plans, 10% to 15% more corn, preserves likely to plant at least flat if not more beans. And if they were to get any kind of trending season like they got picks here and then stock used would rise again and in that scenario, commodity prices would see, likely see a downtick. Could you just address that J. B., and the notion that there is no downside risk?","J. B. Penn","First of all, you have to take 10 or 15 year look at the overall situation. You'll remember before 2006, the trading range for corn, let's say, was something in the $1.75, $2.25 range for most time periods, barring adverse weather; then after 2006, we had ethanol and then we've had lot of other significant changes; 2012 we had the drought and the price records were set. And then the big question was, where will the normal trading range be when we come back from these abnormalities? Well, while we were in those periods, the owned farm cost structure shifted; I mean, look at land prices and cash rents, for instance. So we can't move back to $2 corn over the long term, simply because the cost structure is such that it's just not practical. So the expectation is after three or four years now since 2012, we're seeing corn trade in a price range of something like $3.60 to $4 in a quarter, something like that.","So when you look at farmers\u2019 profit margin that's consistent; when you look at cash grants, when you look at fuel and feed costs, the cost structure has adjusted. So that's why we're at about the -- we're at probably a long term floor price; adverse weather of course will cause the commodity prices to move well above that; and in some seasons, as you suggested, Brazil and Argentina may have bumper crops and we may press the prices a bit; but there will be adjustments. I mean the market still work; you'll see adjustments as we've seen this year in corn and bean acreage, not only here but all around the world now in the major exporting regions.","So we think that the range now is that something like just for example $3.60 to $4.25 say for corn and it'll move around depending on weather scare. But by enlarge, if you had good weather every year, farmers in North America at least can still make money at that and I think in most of the exporting regions as well. So that's the background for that commentary. The expectations are that we've had now essentially almost fully five good years of weather; one of these days, there'll be an adverse weather event like we saw in 2012. So that's the background for that, Ann. Thanks for the question.","Operator","The next question is coming from Steven Fischer of UBS Securities. Your line is now open.","Steven Fischer","Just want to try and reconcile the slightly softer than expected Q3 revenues with the production and revenue guidance increases in Q4. Just wondering why you're raising Q4 revenue guidance? I think it was implied to be about 16%, 17% for the fourth quarter, last quarter. Now, it's implying somewhere around 24%. Is that really just a message about higher production and expected strength into 2018?","Tony Huegel","Well not. I think, how I would answer that is if you look at the sales forecast for the year, if you take out FX and keep in mind there's some brownie in there. So it appears in our guidance that FX was 100% of the change, but there was a little bit of volume increase as well in that sales forecast. But effectively it's unchanged. And so when you think about it from that perspective, while clearly we came in a little short in the third quarter from what we had anticipated, most of those sales simply shifted into the fourth quarter. So it is not a change in our annual guidance, it's just a difference year-over-year, which is always a danger in getting too focused on any individual quarter I would say the same thing from ours.","And if you can have one quarter where you get certain expenses or positives that make the quarter look much worse or much better than it might otherwise; and so it's always important to put that in perspective to the full year. And I think from that when you look at it that way, our margins are still very strong year-over-year, especially when you consider some of the headwinds that we phased with just material alone. And so, I think that\u2019s still a very strong story, and one I think that we will continue to point to. Third quarter again specifically we talked about it. One example, we continue to have headwinds from material. And we had headwinds from warranty, those product improvement programs in the quarter.","And while the sales were up considerably, remember we\u2019re still at relatively low production level. And so as a result of that when you get some of those targets they do tend to be magnified and weigh a little heavier than what they would have a few years ago. And I think that\u2019s part of what transpires in the quarter, in particular.","Steven Fischer","But you also raised the trade receivables and inventory by $375 million, and I assume that was the restructuring of the increased production expectation. But maybe that was just a one-time [multiple speaker] third quarter?","Tony Huegel","I think that there is certainly, as you look at that receivable and inventory increase, I think absolutely, the message there should be the continued confidence and strength as we go into 2018. But keep in mind, as Josh mentioned in his opening comments. When you look at Ag & Turf, in particular, most of that was actually inventory increase and Deere inventory, as you start to ramp up those facilities a little bit earlier in the fourth quarter. There is very little receivable increase. In fact, what to the extent there was receivable, our dealer inventory increase, that was entirely outside the U.S. and Canada for Ag & Turf. And when you look at the U.S. and Canada dealer inventory, it's actually lower year-over-year on our forecast. So the implication that we\u2019re pushing a bunch of sales out this year and effectively pulling them out of 2018 and into 2017, would absolutely not the correct at least if it relates to U.S. and Canada market.","Operator","The next question is coming from Michael Shlisky of Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.","Michael Shlisky","I just wanted to go back over your macro indicator slide for construction. I did notice that the outlook for government construction turned a bit negative here in this quarter. I was concerned that run rates at Wirtgen have softened a bit and we\u2019ve ramped down our growth rate a bit for what you outlined to us back in June.","Tony Huegel","Well, keep in mind that the U.S. and Canada. And so as you think about Wirtgen, it was roughly a quarter of their sales are in the Americas; so not just U.S. and Canada, but all of the Americas, the bulk of their sales actually are coming from Europe and Asia; Europe is the biggest market and then Asia would also be another 25% or so. So again, I would not imply that at all in terms of what the opportunity might be for Wirtgen as we go forward.","Operator","The next question is coming from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research Company. Your line is now open.","Adam Uhlman","I wondering if we could start with Brazil and the order trend that you\u2019ve seen since the government provided additional upside financing. Have you seen demand pick up? And then where do you see the market trending over the next six months? It seems like there is some cross currents with sugar and soybean pricing and currency like the potential headwinds. Could you may be flush that out for us?","Tony Huegel","I think as you think about Brazil, certainly and J. B. I know has been there recently, maybe go chime in as well. But demand continues to be very strong there. There is always a little bit of noise when you go through a transition from one harvest program to the next, and there was a little bit this time around. Although, as Josh mentioned in his opening comments, it was actually one of the more smooth transitions is what we've heard from our group there.","So certainly, and again, we continue to view that market very favorably to the point of the strong income, those farmer customers continue to get experience. That tends to be a pretty positive view as we look out even into 2018. Remember, this is a market we have customers that have remained really pretty profitable even through the downturn and as that stabilization in the broader economy and political uncertainty began to firm up that when that market really took off and we would continue to believe this is really some of the early stages of a true recovery in that market.","J. B. Penn","I would only just add that, as Tony noted, we were there recently. We spend a lot of time with dealers and customers, and there is a very strong positive sentiment among them. Despite all of the politically theater, they\u2019re still very optimistic about the agricultural prospects and the foreign market outlook about the currency. So all-in-all, as Tony said, the outlook is still very positive for Brazil.","Operator","The next question is coming from Andrew Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andrew Casey","Question is on Ag & Turf margin. The guidance for this year implies approximately 11% contribution margin in Q4; despite the revenue growth acceleration, that\u2019s a little lower than I get when I just Q3 for the SiteOne that occurred in both periods that comes out to about 15%, which is a little surprising; given up guessing, you're going to see lower warrant headwinds in Q4; and then potentially, more cost savings benefit; so couple of questions. First, why do you expect the step down in Q4 versus Q3 when it compare to the prior year? And then second, looking out to 2018; is it reasonable to think that Deere can get to about 30% incremental margins all-in or should we think about that performance ex-ing out whatever items and take into account, what looks like a little bit of a headwind?","Tony Huegel","Certainly, if you think about fourth quarter, remember again, I\u2019ll reiterate. While you're still seeing year-over-year higher sales, it's still a lower production month and you still have some pretty significant factories that have shutdowns during that fourth quarter and that would, maybe not to the extent year-over-year. But you're certainly still going to see those shutdowns. Material cost continues to be a headwind as we think about the fourth quarter. If we look at, if we exclude some of those onetime items, the incrementals do get a little better where we\u2019ll be approaching 20% plus; which is, again for fourth quarter, you cannot have quite as much leverage because of the lower level of production.","Again, as you think about going into 2018, when you think about incremental margins it's very difficult to say because as we've talked about before mix matters pretty significantly in terms of where that sales growth is coming from. And remember, we do have -- year-over-year we\u2019ll have headwinds in comparisons for things like SiteOne that won't repeat in 2018. But on the flip side, we would expect not as much headwind on material cost, not as much headwind on things like warranty that we\u2019ve talked about earlier.","So we\u2019ll have to talk more about that in fourth quarter in terms of how all those things balance each other out, and what those margins may look like. But certainly as Raj pointed earlier, if we do start to see that large ag business continue to come back on a broad basis and see increases year-over-year at these lower levels, you should see some pretty attractive incrementals.","Operator","The next question is coming from Seth Weber of RBC. Your line is now open.","Seth Weber","I wanted to go back to construction for a minute. You guys did 10% of your indicator outlooks, while raising your revenue forecast. I'm just trying to understand how much of the raised forecast is actually retail demand versus just dealer re-stock? And can you comment on whether construction pricing is positive for the year within the positive 1% for the Company?","Tony Huegel","Yes. So when you think about construction, think about -- I'll say flattish price for the year. It is slightly better than what we would have been at a quarter ago. We would have been -- I still would if it's said flattish. But on the negative side, this is flattish on the positive side but not a ton of movement as you think about that. Again, remember for our order book the orders tend to be more dealer stock and in that particular business versus retail. Although, retail really beginning in that February time frame have been very positive, continue to be very positive. So that dealer optimism that we've heard and saw very early in the year is translating into retail sales.","Now, when you think about that business in the order books, it continues to be very strong. Remember this is a business that tends to be, I'd say, on average 45 days out depending on the product. And most, if not all, of our fourth quarter production is already filled with orders behind that and dealer order, not retail orders. But that just kind of continues to be evidence that that market continues be very strong year-over-year, and not unlike larger ag, I mean, off of low level, but still seeing some nice uptick and that momentum doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing much. So we're hopeful that will continue well into 2018.","Raj Kalathur","Just to add to Tony\u2019s comment on the order book. Last quarter, we would have set the order book on a year-to-date basis was about 30% to 35% better than the previous year-to-date at that point. That number now, if you take the year-to-date orders for this year it's over 40%, same year-to-date numbers from last year. So stronger order book is one of the reasons you're seeing some of this additional increases.","Operator","Next question is coming from Joel Tiss of BMO. Your line is now open.","Joel Tiss","Is the incentive comp increase, is that all in your cost of goods, or does that include the higher share count too?","Tony Huegel","The incentive comp would be -- it would be split between cost of sales and SA&G, so it would be in both.","Joel Tiss","And then just\u2026","Tony Huegel","That split, by the way, is about 60-40. 60% cost to sales, 40% SA&G.","Joel Tiss","And just because that was a quick question, I see your cash levels grew to $6.5 billion in the quarter. Can you just comment, maybe Raj, about the potential to borrow up to $1 billion for the Wirtgen deal? Has that been adjusted or what are you thinking about that?","Raj Kalathur","The cash growing is essentially to get ready for the Wirtgen deal, you said Joel. So we still haven't borrowed what we said as up to $1 billion being euros so that'll happen between now and closing. And we expect to close Wirtgen in first quarter of '18. So you will see cash increase between now and closing.","Tony Huegel","And so expect when you see our fourth quarter numbers, you should anticipate seeing an even higher level of cash as we bring that cash back to equipment obviously to prepare for that.","Operator","Next question is coming from Sameer Rathod of Macquarie Capital. Your line is now open.","Sameer Rathod","The current administration is looking at Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to investigate China trade. And there's been some indication that China can't hold key U.S. imports in response. My question is how likely these things does unfold, and what are the net impact from the U.S. and Brazilian farmers? Thank you.","Tony Huegel","There is a lot of uncertainty in the general food and agricultural trade arena, as you know. Just this week, the renegotiation of NAFTA is underway; there's rhetoric about an economic war with China; there's 201, 301 cases; all of this creates uncertainty in the food and agricultural area, especially in the U.S. And part of the reason for the heightened uncertainty is as you suggest, while aluminum or steel or some of these commodities are quite a long distance from the agricultural sector, the likelihood of retaliation is always there.","And of course, the agricultural exports from the U.S. are a prime target for that. So that heightens the uncertainty that if we take trade action in one area of the economy then certainly because the U.S. is very prominent and agricultural exports, that could be an area that is very politically sensitive and one in which the other countries are likely to retaliate. So that\u2019s a danger. It's out there. We\u2019re monitoring it very closely, all of the trade developments in Washington and elsewhere in the world.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ross Gilardi of Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ross Gilardi","Just wondering, can you provide an update on latest thoughts on Wirtgen and the prospects of any GAAP earnings accretion in 2018? Or should we still be thinking that restructuring charges and balance sheet adjustments and so forth, potentially offset that next year?","Raj Kalathur","Ross, all we\u2019ll say with respect to Wirtgen is, we\u2019re on track. We\u2019re currently anticipating closing the transaction the first quarter '18. And as of 14th of August, the regulatory approvals are coming in as we have thought. So we have regulatory approvals from nine out of 15 countries. So two of the major ones, Europe and U.S., we have regulatory approvals for. We still have to get regulatory approvals from Russia and China. But once we close you will expect to hear more from us on this topic. Until then, we still have the same things that we told you when we announce Wirtgen. So we really don\u2019t have an update beyond that.","Tony Huegel","All right. Thank you. And again, we appreciate all of the participation and questions. As always, we will be available throughout the day for follow-up calls. Operator?","Operator","And that conclude today's conference.

Thank you for joining us as we discuss what was a great quarter on most fronts. John Deere reported record sales and profits in the quarter, operating margins in the Ag & Turf division were approximately 14%. We successfully launched new products while continuing the build-out of our global footprint, but our sales increased 16%, was short of our guidance by nine percentage points or about $700 million. This had a corresponding negative impact on the bottomline and it was lower than First Call estimates.","The miss was in Ag & Turf; half of the shortfall is due to softening market conditions outside the US; of note, China, India and the EU-27. Additionally, sales were negatively impacted as the granting of import licenses in Argentina continues at a slow pace; timing of and changes to finance programs as well as the weaker Reais affected sales in Brazil and Turf equipment sales in the US were hurt by weather conditions.","The other half of the shortfall is manufacturing execution. The good news is, we expect to make-up the bulk of the sales miss related to execution during the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we had very aggressive production levels as we continue to ramp up our schedules and we experienced some hiccups.","The all new North American Combine line with significant product innovations and IT-4 compliant engines was most challenged and accounts for the bulk of the shortfall. The issue is not quality; in fact we are receiving positive customer views on the machines already in the field. We just had trouble ramping up production to meet the aggressive build schedules in the quarter. As a result, we experienced production delays of up to 14 calendar days.","In addition, we are seeing an unprecedented early harvest of up to four to five weeks in some areas. Consequently, some machines will be shipped too late for harvest and we have allowed dealers to cancel orders. This affects only about 3% of harvester\u2019s 2012 production and as reflected in our updated guidance.","We know, we know less than stellar execution is not what you expect from John Deere. So what happened? There are 40% more unique part numbers in the new Combine\u2019s than previous models; new parts, required new suppliers and new challenges for existing suppliers. We also had a significant number of new employees requiring extensive training, many of whom were hired as production schedules were sharply ramping up. To catch things off, we are running the factory at full speed so there was no downtime to get caught up once we felt behind. These issues have been addressed.","The key is that these are not are quality or customer satisfaction issues. They are execution issues; problems we at John Deere know how to fix. Of course, the sales shortfall is reflected in higher inventories in the third quarter and at year-end; actions have been taken to manage the inventories, but it will take longer than the end of the year to work them off.","However, in summary our quarter was historic, but it could have been better. We did not execute to the usual John Deere standard. Mitigation and corrective actions have been implemented.","And now I'll hand it over to Susan.","Susan Karlix","Thank you, Jim. Before getting to the numbers, the drought and its potential impact on some of our farm and livestock customers is on everyone\u2019s mind and has received a lot of contemporary press coverage. The drought had minimal impact on our third quarter results and the same holds true for our fourth year forecast.","However, as a result of dry weather, global grain supplies are expected to further tighten. This supports higher commodity prices and should result in robust field activity in the 2013 crop year in markets throughout the world. J.B. Penn will discuss the drought and resulting outlook for the agriculture markets in detail shortly.","Back to slide three, let\u2019s take a look at the third quarter in detail. Net sales and revenues were up 15%, $9.6 billion in the quarter. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $788 million.","On slide four, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were $8.9 billion, up 16% quarter-over-quarter. At constant exchange, sales were up 21%. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 5 points.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses let\u2019s start with Agriculture and Turf on slide five. Sales were up 14% in the quarter. Operating profit was $1 billion. Margins improved to 14% from 13% a year ago. And of note, used Combine levels at the end of July were well below year ago levels.","Our 2012 Ag and Turf industry outlook are summarized on slide six. The outlook for industry sales in the US and Canada remains at up more than 10%. Demand continues to be strong especially for high horsepower equipment, a reflection of continued strong commodity prices in the global farm economy, forecasted record cash receipts in the United States and minimal impact expected from the current drought conditions. We have revised the EU-27 industry outlook to flat with the attractive levels of 2011.","Farmer sentiment remains generally positive due to attractive grain, seeds and [port] prices. Differences in the countries of northern and southern Europe continue. In the north, production levels are expected to increase while the South is hampered by droughts. Financing continues more readily available in the north and the overall macro economic factors are having a greater impact in Southern Europe. Our 2012 industry outlook in the CIS countries is up strongly, the tweak from our outlook a quarter ago.","While the farm sector remains strong, above normal temperatures have lowered the yield projections in the CIS by about 20%. In some CIS countries, notably Ukraine are facing financing constraints. In Asia, we now expect sales to be down moderately.","In India, after several years of strong growth, the attractive market is forecast to be down slightly. And the monsoon deficit is expected to lower grain output. The industry outlook for China has softened as government subsidies have been delayed in reaching farmer customers. ","Industry sales of tractors and combines in South America are expected to be down 5% to 10% in relation to the strong levels of 2011, due to the import licensing process in Argentina and drought earlier in the year in parts of the region. It is important to note that the second season of corn production surpass the summer season, planted acres and yield increases combined with record commodity prices bode well for strong crop activity in the region this planting season.","Turning to another product category, we now expect industry retail sales of Turf and utility equipment in the US and Canada to be flat to up about 5% in 2012, impacted by weather conditions in the United States. ","Putting this all together on slide seven, fiscal year 2012 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be up about 13%. This includes the negative currency translation of about four points. At constant currency rates, net sales are expected to be up about 17% compared to 2011. Full year operating margin for the division is forecast at about 15%. ","Before moving to CNS, let\u2019s touch on our early order program. The combine early order program began 1 August while early orders are running ahead of last year. The other seasonal programs for planters, sprayers, drills, air seeding and tillage are running more than 15% higher than last year. ","Let\u2019s focus now on construction and forestry on slide eight. Net sales were up 23% in the quarter, operating profit was a $113 million, for the quarter CNS had a 7% operating margin, the largest sector underlying CNS margins is investments and growth. ","As you know, the division has two new factories growing up in Brazil and one in China adding additional research and development cost and selling and administrative and general expense. In China, sales are not anticipated in the market until late 2013 and the production ramp up will be at a measured pace to insure we deliver the highest quality products to the market. ","Production and shipments in Brazil are not expected to begin until calendar year 2014, while we are currently importing goods into the country to support the development of our dealers group prior to the factories coming online, margins are challenged due to the cost of import and the eligibility for tsunami financing of the imported goods. ","Consequently, we expect growth expenses and cost with little to no revenues from the new factories to run through 2013 and well into 2014. Despite recent market weakness, China holds long-term potential for the construction industry and Brazil is one the world\u2019s fastest growing markets for construction equipment. ","On slide nine, let\u2019s look at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide. Although there are some promising signs that things are picking up overall economic growth continues at a slow pace. CNS continues to benefit from improved sales independent rail companies as they record higher yield utilization levels and rental rates. ","We also see strength in the energy and material handling sectors. Also encouraging, Deere dealers continue to see an improvement in their rental and used equipment markets. Net sales in construction and forestry are now forecast to be up about 17% in fiscal 2012 with negative currency translations up about one point. ","The three point change in our outlook reflects the timing of some shipments to Canada causing sales to be pushed into 2013, a slower start to dealer sales in Brazil and market softening in Russia. Global forestry markets are expected to be flat in 2012 from the strong levels of a year ago. Weakness in Europe is being offset by improvement in other international market. CNS full year operating margin is projected to be about 7%.","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operation. Slide 10 shows the financial services provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average owned portfolio. Year-to-date on an annualized basis the provision is essentially zero reflecting excellent quality of our portfolios as well as some allowance reductions in construction and forestry. Our 2012 financial forecasts contemplates a loss provision of about four basis points as a percent of the average own portfolio down from about 23 basis points last quarter.","Moving to slide 11, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was a $110 million in the quarter versus $126 million in 2011. Net income was impacted by increased selling administrative and general expenses, narrower financing spreads and higher reserves for crop insurance claims partially offset by growth in the portfolio and a lower provision for credit losses. ","Looking ahead, we are now projecting worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company of about $450 million in 2012. The decrease in income from last year is attributable to increased selling administrative and general expenses in support of the equipment operations global growth and narrower financing spreads. Also included is in after tax provision of about $25 million for higher reserves for crop insurance claims, based on the current conditions of the US drought event.","Slide 12 outlines the receivable and inventory numbers that Jim discussed earlier. Now, let's turn to raw material and logistics on slide 13. Third quarter material costs were up about $70 million over last year. Virtually all of the $400 million increase forecast for the year has been incurred year-to-date.","As we have shared in the past, changes in Deere's raw material costs tend to lag the market by three to six months, depending on the type of commodity or contract. About 80% of the increase is for Ag & Turf and about 20% for C&F.","Finally, as we introduce new products and features to our growing customer base, the product cost of compliance with engine emission regulations in North America and Europe will be roughly $475 million higher than 2011. This is a $25 million reduction from the forecast provided in May.","Note however that the combined increase in material and interim tier 4 product costs will be more than offset by what we are forecasting to be, about four points of price realization.","Looking at R&D expense on slide 14. R&D was up 18% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Spending was up about 21% offset by about three points of currency translation impact. Our 2012 forecast calls for R&D expense to be up about 15%. Spending is projected to be about 17%, offset by about two points of currency translation impact.","Moving now to slide 15, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up about 8% in the third quarter. Expense was up about 12% offset by about four points of currency translations impact. Our fiscal year 2012 forecast calls for SA&G expense to be up about 9% with growth accounting for about four points.","Expense is forecast to be up about 12% offset by about three points of currency translation impact. If you want to point out currency movements, both translation and transaction or trade float reduced operating profit excluding R&D and SA&G by about $150 million in the quarter.","Over the course of the year, our trade flows are relatively well balanced but that may or may not be the case in any reporting period. Where there tend to be an annual imbalance we may hedge our exposure using currency forward contracts or currency risk sharing agreements.","On slide 16, pension and OPEB expense was down about $20 million in the third quarter. Our fiscal year 2012 forecast calls for pension and OPEB expense to be down about $110 million, about $85 million of the decrease has occurred year-to-date.","On slide 17, you see our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. We are forecasting cash flow from equipment operations to be about $2.9 billion in 2012, about flat with 2011 record amount. A reduction from our prior year guidance is mainly due to the increase in the inventories forecast for the year.","On slide 18, we outline our 2012 outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. The fourth quarter forecast calls for net sales to be up about 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 3 points with currency translations being approximately negative 4 points. The net sales forecast for the full year is up about 13% compared to 2011 translated at constant exchange, up about 16%.","Price realization of about 4 points will contribute to results. Our full-year 2012 net income forecast is now about $3.1 billion, a company record. And now to discuss this year's record drought. I will turn the call over to Dr. J.B. Penn Former USDA Under Secretary of Agriculture and John Deere's Chief Economist. JB ","J.B. Penn","Good morning. Please turn to slide 19. Just a couple of months ago we had a much different business outlook than we have today. At that time we were looking for some softening of food demand against expected large harvest resulting in increasing stocks and softer commodity prices. In fact there was much media discussion about the end of the cycle for agriculture.","Today the business outlook is vastly different as severe disruption in annual production is occurring owing to the most severe drought and at least half a century in the US drought in the Black Sea region and a diminished monsoon in India along with newly emerging concerns about crop conditions elsewhere. In the foreseeable future the global agriculture plant will be hard pressed to keep pace with demand and replenish stocks to more comfortable level.","Crop analysts are still grappling with full extent of the shortfall and the implications for 2012, 2013, and beyond. However early assessments point to a continued solid Ag sector performance for 2012 and very bright prospects worldwide for 2013.","Turning to slide 20. We are fortunate to have fresh information from last Friday's USDA Crop Report to inform our review. USDA reported revised estimates for acres expected to be harvested this year for acre yields and total output and forecasted season average price for the crops. For corn, the report showed reduction in harvested acres to 87.4 million, another reduction in yield to 123.4 bushels, 10.8 billion bushels production and the midpoint of the forecast season average price was $8.20.","Although this was the largest crop planted since 1973. Production is now forecast to be 13% below last year and the yield of 123.4 bushels per acre is down almost 24 bushels per acre from last year. For Soybeans, the situation was not as severe, but it was down as well. Harvested acres at 74.6, the yield was reduced to 36.1 bushels per acre, production 2.7 billion bushels and the midpoint of the season average price was forecasted at $16.","So for soybeans production is forecast down 12% from last year. For wheat, the situation is much different. The situation was improved especially the price outlook USDA shows now a harvested area of 48.4 million acres, 46.5 bushel per acre yield, 2.3 billion bushels production and the midpoint of the price forecast is $8.30.","So at this point clearly we have more rationing of the old crop corn and soy supplies among competing uses yet to be done and we will have substantial adjustments in the utilizations of new crop supply. Thus grain and oilseed prices are expected to remain strong for the remainder of this year and well into 2013.","Moving now to slide 21, we should note that the crop season still is far from over, and more USDA assessments are yet to be issued and our crop reports of import since September, October and November. It\u2019s very difficult to estimate the affect of the U.S. drought on the corn and soybean yields.","The crop was planted much earlier than usual; conditions vary widely across the country and even in individual fields and genetics today are far superior to those of previous drought. There are no good analog years, thus it will be sometime before final crop size and the full implications become known, but the USDA report provides enough solid information to enable developing the broad outlines of the likely performance of the agricultural economy this year and next.","On slide 22, while the 2012 drought situation is unusual in many respects, a key one is that farmers entered the year in perhaps the strongest financial condition ever. This owes to the several consecutive years of strong farm income and a continually strengthening balance sheet, so the financial health of the farm sector is as strong is it has been in modern times.","Another aspect this year is that crop and revenue insurance opportunities are much improved and coverage is far more widespread than in any previous calamity and while the livestock sector is very severely impacted in parts of the country, the Congress is expected to provide some kind of disaster package to help ameliorate the distress, and farmers now have available much better crop genetics, machinery, technology and management practices than ever before.","Turning to slide 23, Futures Market indicate strong prices across 2012 and 2013; higher prices of course will benefit farmers in 2012 who have a crop to sell and much of the crop that will be harvested remains to be sold and insurance will greatly ameliorate the drought losses. This together suggests the growth receipts from crops will be strong for 2012 and the markets are clearly signaling the need for much more output in the coming season in both the Southern and Northern hemispheres.","Now moving to slide 24, this chart affirms the impacts of higher prices in offsetting reduced output volumes. Cash receipts last year 2011 were an all time record, despite the reduced output due to drought, receipts are expected to be even larger for 2012. And looking ahead to 2013, strong prices with a normal crop will propel revenues even higher to yet another record and aggregate growth receipts are the best predictors of large agriculture product sales.","On slide 25, this chart reaffirms the strong condition of the farm sector going into the drought. Net cash farm income set new records in six of the past 10 years. 2011 was the all-time record high income year and 2012 as now forecast by USDA will be perhaps the second best. We will have a new forecast at the end of the month and the Future spices are signaling that with good crops next year could be just as strong.","Now looking at slide 26, it shows that while cash flow to the sector had been strong, the sector balance sheet also has been strengthened appreciably. The financial ratios are strong, farmers have managed debt exceptionally well in recent years while asset values have grown steadily. Overall, looking at both, cash flow and the balance sheet, the farms sector entered the drought this year far stronger than in any previous droughts.","Now turning to slide 27, another distinguishing feature of this drought is the widespread use of crop and revenue insurance. Farmers are now able to guarantee revenue as well as yield and coverage is extensive for the major crops in the drought affected areas. We know that about 85% of the corn and soybean acreage was enrolled in an insurance program in 2011 and industry analysts suggests that as much or more is enrolled in 2012.","The level of coverage generally is adjusted to reflect current price conditions which at harvest time will reflect the run up in prices of the past few weeks. As a point of reference, insurance indemnities paid in 2011 were about $11 billion and early estimates reported by the University of Illinois and others suggest indemnities could be well above last year\u2019s amount.","Livestock farmers have little access to insurance of course; pastures across wide areas have been very severely damaged and higher feed cost have significantly eroded margins; herds are being reduced in response to pushing prices lower. Congress is expected to provide disaster systems to livestock farmers whose pastures have been severely damaged by drought and who face much higher feed costs.","The House of Representatives, before adjourning for the summer recess passed the $383 million Drought Assistance Package. And the Congress is expected to act upon return to enact either standalone drought package or a new farm bill that contains livestock farmer assistance. So both insurance indemnities and disaster systems augment the receipts from strong prices, leading to the strong cash receipts expected and forecasted for this sector.","Now to slide 28. There are no good examples of how farmers may react to this year\u2019s adversities, but a review of history shows that previous large scale adverse weather event years have been followed by strong sales in the following year, as the graph shows. This was the case for the drought of 1988 and the floods experienced in 1993, but it\u2019s true that the fleet in North America this time is newer than in previous times. But again, gross cash receipts are the strongest predictor of large Ag equipment sales.","Moving to slide 29, while the 2012 agricultural economic and equipment sales picture is coming into much clear view, what are the implications for 2013? Clearly, the adverse growing conditions in the US have been combined with those in other parts of the worlds and are serving to push prices worldwide to near record levels. The effect of course will be to encourage expanded agricultural activities worldwide in the coming season.","This will be seen most immediately in the Southern Hemisphere crop plantings, especially in Brazil and Argentina where strong prices are expected to boost areas sowned especially for major crops of corn and soybean. And it should be noted that farmer sentiment in that region today at the beginning of the season is very positive.","We should also not overlook the fact that the drought has not extended to Canada, which expects a bountiful harvest this fall to be marketed at very strong prices, so Canada too will be very responsive to strong prices in 2013.","Turning to slide 30, this slide portraying production and consumption of all range worldwide illustrates the challenge faced by the global agricultural plant in the past dozen years in trying to keep pace with the steadily rising demand. This rising demand reflects the ascendancy of the emerging market and developing market economies. For 2012-\u201813 forecast production again falls a bit short of the consumption requirements, boosting prices and encouraging additional output in the following year.","As can be seen on slide 31, the precarious global stocks to use ratios are evident. This is the amount of grain carried over at the end of each year relative to the amount needed for an entire year\u2019s consumption. Grain stocks are low worldwide and historically low in the US for corn and soybean, thus large harvest will be required for the next couple of seasons to not only meet the consumption requirements but to also rebuild stocks to more comfortable levels.","In closing on slide 32, I would just note that the current situation is unprecedented sometime will be required to fully understand all the loan ramifications on the farm sector in the US and on farmers worldwide and to fully appreciate the implications for the farm equipment business. ","Early assessments however suggest that the US farm sector is much better prepared to absorb the impact than in previous history and that farmers worldwide are poised to respond to much stronger commodity prices with expanded agricultural activity next year. Thus we continue to see aggregate sector performance for 2012 to be very strong and for that performance to continue across 2013 at least.","","Tony Huegel","Thank you for joining us today J.B. Now we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedures, but as a reminder and consideration of others especially with our more limited Q&A time today. Please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. If you have additional questions to be asked, you rejoin the queue. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jerry Revich and please state your company name. ","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Can you update us on what was the impact of the transition to interim with your four products and your factory cost this year given the adjustment you made this quarter and please step us through how their interim tier four product transition plan for 2013 compared to the range of products that you transitioned as here? Thank you. ","Marie Ziegler","In terms of 2013 I will go backwards, Jerry. 2013 that will be very modest transitions, I think there is a couple of products throughout the product line now we will again of course in 2014 start complying with final tier four. In terms of the cost may be the best way to characterize the cost what our previous forecast was and total cost which 300, help me Tony do you have that number 320 something or 325? 325 million is the production impacts from all the transition it\u2019s not listed in the quarter but really the forecast for the full year. ","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","","Thanks Marie and then can you talk about how you are thinking about your production schedule over the next three months to nine months you mentioned inventories in some areas are higher than you would have liked. Just wonder if you could step us through how we should be thinking about the schedule from here. You mentioned that early order combine programs up to a good start but I think you had restricted number of swaps you allowed a year ago, can you just step us through the production schedule broadly?","Marie Ziegler","I can comment certainly on the remaining three months in the year. I can\u2019t comment on 2013 and Jerry, basically you can see that we not only adjusted because of the third quarter results were a little lighter on sales this quarter but we did make some adjustments for the [fourth] quarter as well and really that is reflected in the (inaudible) of the international markets and the desire to get those inventories back in line. It will take a little bit of time because for some of those products are spring season products and move until into next year. ","Tony Huegel","I was going to add too Jerry. This is Tony. If you look at combine and you mentioned that specifically. This year as you know, our shipping pattern was vastly different than what would be kind of normal average where we had about 75% of the shipments in the behalf of the year and that again was related to the interim tier four transition during 2012 and as a reminder, the weighted average of the three years to four years prior to that would have been 35, 65 and with expect, probably go back to a more normal shipping pattern next year?","Marie Ziegler","And maybe just one final point. In terms of the manufacturing, execution, we expect to make most of that up in the fourth quarter and again that\u2019s awfully reflected in the forecast. Thank you Jerry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Gupta and please state your company name.","Ashish Gupta - CLSA ","Just kind of wondering if you could give us a little more color on sort of where lead times are right now and where your order book is relative to a year ago?","Marie Ziegler","Well again the early programs ex-combines because combines are its very, very early for that. They are running about 15% above year ago levels and combines are off to a very solid start but it\u2019s just only a couple of weeks into our program that runs for several months, so it\u2019s pretty mature to quote statistics.","","Tony Huegel ","Yeah on the tractors again this is Tony, again eight hour tractors and the nine hour tractors are running very similar to what we would have a year ago.","Ashish Gupta - CLSA ","And then just on the incremental margins I guess your guidance implies that I know the manufacturing issues are being worked through but I guess the guidance for operating margins would imply incremental would be up in the fourth quarter sequentially?","","Marie Ziegler ","","I think well what our guidance speaks for itself on that. Thank you Ashish.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan and please state your company name.","","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","","Nice to hear you J.B. And I guess my questions probably targeted to you also and I appreciate on slide 19 that your port (inaudible) refers to potentially very positive year for agriculture and farmers for 2013, but could you talk about some of the risks also J.B. may be in terms of availability of seed or the extension of the drug into next year and the fleet is newer versus prior cycles, could you just talk about some of the downside risks but could potentially be a headwind type into next year.","","J.B. Penn","Yeah so Ann it\u2019s good to hear you, I think you mention probably what I would think is the greatest risk and that is continuation of adverse weather in various parts of the world. If we continue to have a prolong drought, then of course that's going to reduce output and keep prices high and effect farmers' bottom lines of course. Beyond that I don\u2019t think there are any other big risk lurking like seed shortages or fertilizer shortages or things of that nature.","I don\u2019t see that. There may be some in various parts of the world, but they are very localized if they exist. So I think weather is probably the biggest risk that in the agriculture business that we can see at this moment.","And I should note that South America is gearing up now as you know for the planting season, there is lot of enthusiasm there. They are looking to expand area and of course to take advantage of these very high corn and soy prices now.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","And my follow up question is on your crop insurance business. Can you give us a little bit more color. We know that you've reinsured that business and you took a $25 million charge. Is that what you anticipated the full-year loss might be and then should we anticipate higher SG&A costs in financial services just on the potential huge volume with claims that given the crop [wave] out there. Can you just talk a little bit more about that business.","Jim Field","Julianne, this is Jim and the provision that we have talked about in the press release is our current best estimate of what we will be dealing with in terms of insurance and as you know there is a significant amount of reinsurance that backs the policies that we write and we are just left with some of the residual risk.","But to put in perspective we took kind of the aggregate industry wide losses that we were looking at and we said what happens if that doubles. And even if that doubles, you know, you would be talking about something that would be less than $50 million impact to the financial services operation. So, clearly you know de minimis in the grand scheme of $3.1 billion net income.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Casey. ","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","I guess turning to construction and forestry, could you elaborate on the magnitude and drivers for that Canadian shipment delay you talked about because in that segment, you\u2019re looking for your guidance for a pretty sharp moderation in Q4 growth from Q3 on a year-over-year basis. Is that decrease really driven by the Canadian thing or is it equally split between the three different factors that you talked about?","Tony Huegel","Yeah the Canadian piece would certainly a big part of that, a big part of that change and as a reminder in Canada, we do have consigned inventory there and so we don\u2019t recognize the sale until the retail sale to the customer. So that part of that shipping delay issue is getting in to the country in time to recognize the retail sale.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","And just a follow up on that, is this part of the inventory increase the outlook for the year?","Marie Ziegler","It will be a very small part of it. The bigger story quite candidly is Ag, but you can see from the guidance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann.","","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies","A couple of quick questions I think for you. You talk about the farm income or actually I guess the cash receipts forecast on slide 24 here and I guess it seems to me like the big difference this year is going to be a lot more of that is going to be made up of government payments and insurance payments. Do you have just kind of a guesstimate of how that\u2019s going to change year-to-year?","J.B. Penn","It\u2019s pretty clear that crop insurance indemnity paid to farmers will be larger this year than last year. There are no good estimates yet because the data are still being accumulated, but it will be significantly more than last year, I think everyone expects. Government payments from the commodity programs will probably not be as much this year as last year because prices are higher. And except for the direct payments which are made regardless of prices, those will stay the same.","So I think we are mostly looking at gross receipts being made up of sales in the marketplace plus crop insurance, plus the little bit of government payments. So it\u2019s a little bit mixed from last year, but not terribly different except for crop insurance indemnity.","Marie Ziegler","I am going to just chime in here because I think the relevant question is do they spend these payments from crop insurance or government any differently on the survey data and the past history suggest that that is treated as regular revenue and I think that\u2019s a significant fact.","Jim Field","And the other thing I would add is, I mean to put in perspective we are talking about aggregate receipts that are better in the range of 400 billion. On the crop insurance I think we told you about 11 billion last year. So if you assume that goes up by 50% you are talking still you know just over a point of the total amount of the payment stream. So it has got a lot of headline line value, but if you step back and look at it in the aggregate, it's not a very big chunk of the overall total.","Steven Volkmann - Jefferies","You can answer this one real quick. I think the answer is no, but based on all the stuff you have given us here which is fairly bullish I think for 2013, are you willing to say that you think 2013 can be a year of growth for your Ag businesses globally?","Marie Ziegler","I would tell you that. No, of course we are not going to provide you with an outlook for 2013 other than to say certainly we are trying to paint a picture of very strong positive fundamentals and while saying as always there is a little bit of caution. But things look very encouraging for most sectors of agriculture.","Operator","And the next question comes from David Raso.","David Raso - ISI Group","I was just wondering if you can really just help clarify the changes in guidance. If you look the revenue change in the guidance, it's roughly 575 million or 600 million, but the EBIT went down 350 million to 375 million or. So it is a pretty hefty decremental margin there of over 60%. It will be helpful, can you bucket the pieces driving that?","For example and people try to think to that combine issue? How much of the 350 million to 375 million EBIT would you allocate to that, you know how much of the Canadian issue with construction, we\u2019re just trying to get a feel for how much do you feel it was? It was a tough quarter on execution for combine. The couple issues we mentioned to get a feel of how are you looking at the run rate. And so it\u2019s maybe what's driving that big detrimental margin? Is the revenue really the guidance listed go down that much but your EBIT, your implied EBIT went down pretty healthy amount?","Jim Field","Well, you know, I tried to address some what of this in my comment that when you look at the sales for the quarter, 50% was related to these issues that we were able to caught up on largely in the fourth quarter and 50% was related to weakening markets and the bottom line impact would be relatively similar.","Marie Ziegler","One of the things, David, that you probably wouldn\u2019t have had, we certainly wouldn\u2019t have had in our forecast is the impact of exchange.","David Raso - ISI Group","Yes, that would be the other big piece of.","Marie Ziegler","And this, can\u2019t answer that you know, it is a positive benefit in SG&A and R&D expense, it\u2019s about $150 million in the quarter and certainly that pre-tax number and that had an impact and for those of you who may not be familiar, we have over the course of the year very well balance trade flows, but they don\u2019t perfectly match on any given day. So you get some noise because of that and the other things is that where we [aren\u2019t] perfectly balanced, we do have hedging programs but as a practical matter, you don\u2019t necessarily or unable in some cases to perfectly hedge a 100% of that exposure and you are aware certainly of what's happened with the dollar relative to other currencies.","David Raso - ISI Group","So maybe help me with math. The shortfall this quarter was 725 million of revenues roughly?","Marie Ziegler","David I think in the interest of time if you want to talk more tactically, we will be happy to take that offline. Do you have another?","David Raso - ISI Group","Well then I guess this is the same question about the inventory and receivable increase. How would you bucket that a little more succinctly if you could -- how much was just simply higher inventory receivables than you had planned on versus how much of a purposeful look at confidence in 2013, just trying to understand the moving pieces of that unless (inaudible) if that same is going up 725 million higher than the previous guidance for receivable inventory?","Marie Ziegler","Thanks. I would say basically last time our guidance had been up about 600 for receivables and inventories and that really reflects the underlying market conditions and the balance of the increase really reflects some market slowdown and some timing of production primarily.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Can we just follow up on what Raso was talking about, you have told us that you had a big impact from inefficiencies, can you quantify that. Could you claim you can make that up so we can't 50:50 and make it impact and make it up in the fourth quarter and still be down $350 million, $300 million plus in guidance for EBIT. So can you separate out the impact of the --","Unidentified Company Representative","I think what we said what we are going to catch up on is most of the sales shipments.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","It\u2019s the sale shipments you are capping on, not the production inefficiencies in the quarter?","Jim Field","Well no obviously we are going to be much more efficient, but to the extent that we generated inefficiencies related to not hitting these those are going to be with us for the balance of the year.","Marie Ziegler","Eli may be just a short look at it, it\u2019s very difficult to calculate an exact number, but we would tell you that we are in the pretax somewhere in the range of $50 million to $75 million and that will incrementally reflect due at the disruptions if you will.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","That will be made up in the fourth quarter, of that magnitude?","Marie Ziegler","No, that money that is, that\u2019s the current cost from some of the transitional activity issues; the production will get made up at some of that operating efficiency (inaudible)","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","And as a follow-up can we talk a little bit about the insurance income that we protected, but there is a real debate as to when it will be paid and it will be reflected, we talked about later than earlier because typically when you have October fiscal year and odd may be recognized, the recognition may not be the fiscal 2013, 2012; does that mean any implications of how you have to run your business in the third quarter, but the first part of next year and can you give us some color on the recognition income could be well may be matched in the following expenditure may be spent early only to resonate earlier?","Marie Ziegler","Well, first of all, farmers come into this very strong balance sheet and then very solid financial position and if they are waiting for some revenue obviously you know some of our products are seasonal products and they are on waivers.","Jim Field","And then second of all you have a component of it, not all the buyers are cash buyers and so you know they have a solid balance sheet and they have a solid looking projection with insurance receipts that they haven\u2019t recovered but they are going to be there, they also have the ability to finance these machines.","Marie Ziegler","And I should also for our John Deere Crop Insurance customers I will point out that we are very adequately staffed in terms of adjustors. The timing of when they receive the payments depends on the farmer context, context and when the insurance adjustors able to make the assessment and we have adequate staff to cover this event.","Tony Huegel","And Eli, may be to your point in terms of those that have the revenue protection, there is initial payments that are made and then if as the prices come out from RMA later, there maybe an additional payment made at that time.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","So it\u2019s a dual payment system. Does it come upfront anyway?","Tony Huegel","Correct, yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vance Edelson and please state you company name.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley","Thanks its Morgan Stanley. So keeping in mind the weather is perhaps the biggest risk on a global basis and just thinking about the future, the US drought impact has been fairly minimal, but Southern Europe has been hampered by drought in South America to some extent as well. Could you provide a little more detail on how the specific dynamics in North America that make it more resilient may simply not exist in other regions. So in terms of insurance coverage ability, the lock-in future prices, farmer balance sheet strength, the technology; is this really all quite unique to North America or to the U.S.?","Marie Ziegler","I think perhaps as you think about Europe, the most important things is to remember the overlay of the economic backdrop there and the situation in Southern Europe, I think is perhaps most relevant with what's happening economically. And I think that in this particular case, the drought is an unfortunate add-in, but really not a major factor driving the results there; J.B. do you have anything else to add?","J.B. Penn","No, I think you mentioned the reasons that North America maybe unique and it should rebound from this drought very quickly again assuming that weather is normal next year.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley","Okay and as a closely related follow-up within the US could you expand a little on the differences larger farmers versus smaller ones in terms of their ability to deal with the drought, are the smaller farmers becoming more sophisticated year-after-year?","J.B. Penn","Well first of all, I think we should make the delineation between crop farmers and livestock farmers and I do want to point out that livestock farmers in certain parts of the country are very severely affected by this drought, and they don\u2019t have interims available to the same extent that they crop farmers do. So they are seeing their pastures completely destroyed their hay crops are non-existent, so they are having a very severe adjustment process. The crop farmers on the other hand varies by region of the country as to how severely they have been affected and of course most have access to crop insurance so that\u2019s going to make a big difference. ","I think as you suggest the large farmers generally have better risk management programs both for natural disaster and for price and income fluctuation, so I think they are probably better geared to manage this adversity than some of the smaller farmers would be, but by and large, the high affect everybody who has got product to sale and it affects them in a very positive way.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook and please state your company name.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Hi, good morning Credit Suisse. Two questions, one of which I don\u2019t think you will answer but I\u2019ll try. I guess Jim just longer term, I mean you guys have given a picture without giving specific guidance about 2013 but sort of consistent with that you said at the analyst day that you feel okay about demand for farmer equipment for 2013, I guess my question is more on the incremental margin line without giving specific guidance about incremental margins, can you sort of talk about potentially the positives and the negatives that we should be thinking towards we are thinking about incremental margins because you mentioned US should be fine but mentioned some specific issues may be we don\u2019t have as much tier four headwind, we have inventory issues that run into 2013, you talked about Brazil and China on the scene, I am just sort of wondering if you could give more color there? And then my second question is if you could just elaborate on some of the suppliers that you mentioned during the earnings call where they are? And how, what your comfort level is at the suppliers switch down continue into 2013? Thanks.","Jim Field","Jamie, this is Jim. Let me talk about the supplier question. I think in that regard, we more or less what we are going to say on that you know, we have isolated issues from time but beyond that we are not going to say much more right now. Also on the 2013, I think on that to get much more color we are going to have to wait until the next call, that we are in the process quite frankly right off pulling together our first cut of the budget for 2013 and I think we would be wise to wait until we have that run through the process before we could start talking about 2013. So thank you very much. ","Tony Huegel","Operator we have time for one more call. ","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Henry Kirn, and please state your company name.","Henry Kirn - UBS","You mentioned financing challenges in Southern Europe and [CASC]. Can you give some view on how significant the headwinds were to demand and are you wiling to step up in financial services presence to keep credit available in the key markets?","Marie Ziegler","You are correct. We do have credit operations in several of these countries and so the answer is yes, we're able to help out and that had offset. In some markets, there is just not a lot of credit available. You are aware of the banking, some of the banking system issues, and that\u2019s also affecting some of the speed with some of these things are processed.","So it is a factor quite candidly, certainly not the largest factor, but something that we wanted to put aside, but it's not a huge factor at this moment.","Henry Kirn - UBS","And there is follow up. On the cancelled combine orders, do you expect the customers who are canceling orders to buy from someone else or use their old combines and then come back and buy from you in the future?","Jim Field","Yeah, Henry. I think it's important to note that most of those cancellations were not retail orders. The bulk of those were dealer purchase for stock, but it didn\u2019t reflect the reduction in retail.","Marie Ziegler","And you bet we expect that those very few customers who have delayed or not purchased because we\u2019re not going to get the combine to them on a timely basis, we'll be definitely in the market for the most productive best John Deere harvesting equipment that we ever had available. And with that Tony.","Tony Huegel","Okay. Before we close this call, I just want to circle back on some items that we covered earlier.","First of all, this was a great quarter on many fronts. The best ever third quarter for sales and profits. We clearly have work ahead of us though as we resolve the manufacturing issues from the third quarter and focus on managing our inventory levels lower, but we are up to task.","2013 looks to be a very positive year for agriculture and many farmers. There is no question of the urgent need to rebuild global stock with our highly productive equipment, John Deere is well positioned to play a key role.","With that we thank you for your participation in the call and as always we will be available for rest of the day to answer any additional questions you have. Operator?","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you for your participation.

John Deere\u2019s strong performance continued in the third quarter of 2013. Earnings jumped 26% on a sales increase of 4%. Both earnings and sales were the highest of any third quarter in the company\u2019s history and it marked our 13th quarter in a row of record profits.","The game was led by ag and turf, which had another terrific quarter, with operating margins of about 17%. Financial services also made a major contribution, while construction and forestry kept profits in line with last year in spite of a slump in sales.","No doubt, John Deere is being helped by a strong market for large farm machinery in North and South America. However, our results showed disciplined execution of our business plans too, plans focused on winning new customers around the world while keeping a close watch on costs and asset levels. In all, it was a productive quarter, putting John Deere well on the way to another very good year. ","Now let\u2019s take a look at the third quarter in detail, beginning on slide three. Net sales and revenues were up 4% in the quarter, to $10 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $997 million. As noted, both sales and income were the best ever third quarter results recorded by the company. ","On slide four, total worldwide equipment [operator] net sales were $9.3 billion, up 4% quarter over quarter, including an unfavorable impact from currency translation of about 1 point. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 3 points. ","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let\u2019s start with agriculture and turf on slide five. Sales were up 8% in the quarter, on continuing strength in the global ag economy, especially North and South America. Operating profit was $1.3 billion, up 32%.","The division\u2019s results included an impairment charge for long lived assets related to John Deere Water of approximately $50 million pretax, $44 million after tax. Before we review the industry sales outlook, let\u2019s look at some of the fundamentals [affecting] the ag business. ","Slide six outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. For the year ahead, crop yields are forecast to be higher than in 2012, and much closer to normal, but prices will be somewhat lower. This reflects recovery from last year\u2019s drought conditions.","Conversely, livestock receipts are forecast to be higher in 2013 than 2012. As a result of these factors, our forecast calls for 2013 cash receipts to be about $390 billion, the second highest on record, and a solid level of income.","On slide seven, with forecasts of a bumper crop, lower crop prices, and an increase in stock [unintelligible] ratios, our initial outlook for 2014 U.S. farm cash receipts is down modestly, but remains at a historically high level, approximately $380 billion. 2014 cash receipts, the number one predictor of farm equipment sales, are expected to remain at an excellent level, helping keep farmers in a financially sound position. ","Our economic outlook for the E.U. 28 is on slide eight. We continue to see offsetting trends in the E.U. on the one hand, ag fundamentals remain positive and production is expected to increase about 7%. Above average commodity prices are driving supportive farm income. Beef prices are leveling off at historic highs while pork and milk prices are favorable.","On the other hand, farm machinery demand is expected to be lower in 2013, as the financial crisis continues to weigh on farmer sentiment and softness in the U.K. continues. On slide nine, you\u2019ll see the economic fundamentals outlined for a few of our other targeted growth markets. Of note is the decline in our outlook for the CIS countries. ","The market is softer than our previous forecast, as import duties continue affecting combine demand in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. Hot, dry weather has impacted crop prospects in southern Russia and Ukraine, and credit availability is also hurting equipment demand.","Slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness in Brazil. With expectations for a strong soybean crop due to an increase in acres planted, higher yields, and sustained high crop prices, the 2013 value of ag production in Brazil is expected to increase about 6% over the 2012 level.","Our 2013 ag and turf industry outlook is summarized on slide 11. In the U.S. and Canada, we continue to see strength in demand, especially for high horse power tractors and combines. We continue to project industry sales to be up about 5% in relation to the healthy levels of 2012. The E.U. 28 industry outlook is down about 5%, no change from our prior forecast. ","Throughout fiscal 2013, we have, each quarter, raised the industry outlook for South America, and we have done so again. Based on a combination of positive farm fundamentals, plus supportive financing programs in Brazil, we now expect industry sales of tractors and combines in South America to be up about 20% in 2013.","South America continues to grow in importance for Deere. Our tractor market share has grown considerably, but our strong presence in combines, sugarcane harvesters, and feeding equipment should not go unnoticed.","Shifting to the CIS, as we noted earlier, our 2013 industry outlook is now moderately lower, a decrease from a quarter ago. In Asia, we continue to forecast little change in industry sales from 2012.","Turning to another product category, we now expect industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be up about 5% in 2013, as favorable summer weather has driven much stronger demand. Deere is seeing strength in commercial mowing equipment, utility vehicles, and zero track mowers. ","Putting all of this together on slide 12, fiscal year 2013 Deere sales of worldwide ag and turf equipment continue to be forecast to be up about 7%, including about 1 point of negative currency translation. 2013 operating margin for the ag and turf division is forecast at about 16%, a point increase since our last forecast.","As we have discussed all year, last year\u2019s fourth quarter sales were particularly strong. Production schedules were higher to accommodate the interim tier 4 transition at a time when the factories were running at very high rates to catch up with customer orders.","Consequently, sales for ag in the fourth quarter of 2013 are expected to be lower than the fourth quarter a year ago. This reflects a tough comparison. It does not indicate any change in our outlook for demand or global ag fundamentals.","Let\u2019s focus now on construction and forestry on slide 13. Net sales were down 11% in the quarter, and operating profit was down 5% due to lower shipment volumes. That $190 million decline in sales was only a $6 million reduction in operating profit is a reflection of price realization, good execution, and lever pulling to control costs in response to slow demand.","On slide 14, looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, the outlooks for GDP and government spending have softened since last quarter. Although overall economic growth continues at a sluggish pace, we are beginning to see some positive indicators. ","While moving very slowly, residential investment is growing, home sales and prices are increasing, and there are reports that the number of build-ready lots are dwindling. Global forestry markets are now expected to be up 5-10% in 2013, as weakness in Europe and Russia is more than offset by improvement in North America. Forestry markets in the U.S. are considerably higher due to the year over year increase in housing starts. ","Fiscal 2013 net sales in construction and forestry are now forecast to be down about 8%. Our previous outlook was down about 5%. The year over year sales decline is reflected in lower inventory and receivable numbers, and it has had an impact on mix as we reduce shipments of high margin equipment. C&F full year operating margin is now projected to be about 6%, a 1 point improvement from last quarter, as the division is pulling levers and cutting costs to meet its operating goals. ","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operations. Slide 15 shows the financial services provision for credit losses at 3 basis points, based on the percentage of the total average owned portfolio at the end of the quarter. This reflects the excellent quality of our portfolios and recoveries from prior year\u2019s writeoff. ","Our 2013 financial forecast now contemplates a loss provision of about 5 basis points as a percentage of the average owned portfolio. This is well below the 10-year average of about 28 basis points.","Moving to slide 16, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $150 million in the third quarter, versus $110 million last year. The increased provision for credit losses cited in the press release is a function of small reductions taken in the third quarter of 2012. The loss experienced on the portfolio remains at an extremely low level.","For the full year, net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $560 million. Slide 17 outlines receivables and inventory. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter up about $20 million, or equal to approximately 30% of prior 12-month sales, compared with 32.3% a year ago.","The year over year forecasted downward tweak in ag is due to the impact of currency and reflects no real change in absolute inventory levels. C&F is now projected to be down about $175 million as we respond to slowing demand and a reduction in Canadian confined inventories.","We expect to end 2013 with receivables and inventory up about $50 million. Our guidance for cost of sales as a percentage of net sales, shown on slide 18, remains at approximately 74% for the full year. Factors affecting cost of sales include price realization, production or manufacturing costs, raw material costs, engine emissions product costs, absorption, and effects of foreign currency.","When modeling the full year, keep in mind the following: price realizations: we are forecasting about 3 points in 2013; favorable year over year raw material costs; the impact on cost of sales of new employees; interim tier four product costs; absorption due to the low levels of inventory compared to 2012; and an unfavorable mix of product in C&F, as we talked about earlier.","Looking at R&D expense on slide 19, R&D was down about 8% in the third quarter, compared with the same period last year. This is consistent with our earlier guidance that the increase in R&D spending for 2013 would occur in the first half of the year. Our 2013 forecast continues to call for R&D expense to be up about 3% for the full year. ","Moving now to slide 20, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up about 4% in the third quarter. Very much like R&D, the quarter over quarter increases for SA&G were heavily weighted to the first half of the year. SA&G expense is forecast to be up about 7% in 2013, no change from our previous guidance.","On slide 21, pension and OPEB was up about $15 million in the quarter, compared with last year. ","Turning to slide 22, the equipment operations tax rate was about 36% in the third quarter. For full year 2015 the effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34-36%, representing no change from our previous forecast.","On slide 23, UCR equipment operations\u2019 history of strong cash flow: our forecast for cash flow from equipment operations is now about $3.8 billion in 2013. Of note is a $700 million Deere & Company debt maturity in April 2014.","On slide 24, we outline our 2013 outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Our net sales forecast for the fourth quarter is down about 5% compared with 2012, due to the extremely tough comparison discussed earlier. This includes about 3 points of price realization. ","The full year forecast calls for net sales to be up about 5%, with 1 point of unfavorable exchange. Thus, the forecast at constant currency up about 6% represents no change from our last forecast. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 3 points. Finally, our full year 2013 net income forecast has increased to about $3.45 billion.","In closing, John Deere is well on the road to another year of impressive performance. Even with a difficult comparison in store for the fourth quarter, our financial guidance implies a healthy level of income, helping us wrap up a third consecutive year of record results.","Also, it is significant to note that Deere has been consistently setting new performance records despite facing some significant headwinds, including a sluggish global economy, political gridlock in Washington, and a host of major product changeovers associated with more stringent emissions rules.","As for the longer term picture, it remains extremely bright. Indeed, the broad trends we\u2019ve been talking about, based on a growing, richer, more urban population appear to have plenty of staying power, staying power that we believe will help the company deliver substantial value to its customers and investors for years to come.","Tony? ","Tony Huegel ","Thank you, Susan. Now we\u2019re ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedures, but as a reminder, in consideration of others, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow up. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Operator? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Ross Gilardi. And please state your company name.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America ","I just wanted to ask about your cash receipt outlook. If you look at your cash receipt outlook for 2014, if you\u2019re right, cash receipts will essentially have been flat for the last four years, from 2011 to 2014. Yet Deere\u2019s top line has obviously grown substantially, so is the relationship between cash receipts and equipment breaking down? Is there risk that you have to give a lot of that sales increase back in coming years, even if cash receipts are kind of flattish next year? Could you explain that? Because clearly your sales have been growing at a much faster pace than cash receipts for the last several years.","Tony Huegel ","And I just want to clarify. You\u2019re speaking to the U.S. farm cash receipt number, and as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, that is probably the best indicator of equipment sales. And we have talked about, in recent years, that in these very high levels of cash receipts, when you see fluctuations plus or minus 5%, we would view those really as relatively flattish. ","And so to your point, longer term, certainly we don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a breakdown in the correlation between cash receipts and equipment sales, but when you\u2019re at these very high levels, it isn\u2019t necessarily as direct of a relationship as you would see over a longer cycle. ","Marie Ziegler ","Maybe just to add to what Tony said, first, we have had very good price realization, and we have benefited from the array of new products that we have introduced over the last several years, including in Brazil, which has been a very strong growth market for us, and we have significantly increased our presence and our sales in that market. So you\u2019ve really seen the benefit of a number of investments.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America ","And could you just clarify, you\u2019ve increased your net income outlook, but kept your sales outlook unchanged. Why is that?","Marie Ziegler ","Better execution. You\u2019re seeing good discipline in terms of our R&D, our SA&G, factory spend, and we have successfully gone through the balance of the IT4 transition, so a number of positive trends. And again, kudos to our operating folks.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz. And please state your company name. ","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays","Maybe you can give us a little more color on the early order book in the context of, we know you had a combine program out there that was sort of early, early order program. And then maybe if you can talk about, has there been any impact from the recent drop in crop prices on that order book?","Tony Huegel ","With combines in particular, it\u2019s a little difficult to talk about year over year changes, because it is different this year. We did have a window in June really related to our final tier 4 transition, specifically our early order program begins in August. That program went very well, but keep in mind that it was a relatively short window, and then we\u2019ll open up the early order program again after our new product introduction for final tier 4 production in 2014. So it\u2019s fairly early.","On the other early order programs, though, the spring order programs, that would be planters, seeding equipment, tillage in particular, we had a very very good year in 2012 with the early order program. And we\u2019re running about flat with those programs last year. And so again, that bodes very well. Again, it\u2019s early, of course, but the early order programs to date are doing very well.","And I would point out, to the extent that the combine early order program in June, all the slots did fill as expected. And then the other thing, while we\u2019re talking about order book into next year that we tend to talk about at this point, is on tractors. As you know, we don\u2019t have an early order program, because it\u2019s not seasonal, but again, tractors are at or better than, in most cases, they were a year ago. ","In fact, if you look at our 8R tractors, on the wheeled tractors, we\u2019re basically out into April-May on our availability, which takes us beyond our final tier 4 transition. Last year availability was January. 8R tracks are roughly in line with a year ago. The 9R, the large four-wheel drive tractors, wheeled tractors are a little ahead this year. They\u2019re November. Last year was September, and then the tracks are a little bit behind year over year. ","But again, generally speaking, when you look at our order books, we\u2019re in a very strong position against very high levels last year.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays ","Can I ask you about the U.S. farm cash receipts forecast in a different way? Specifically, you only have crop receipts dropping about 4% despite what corn prices have done lately over the summer. You guys are usually pretty conservative with your forecasts, yet if I talk to the bears out there on ag, they would say your forecast looks not conservative at all. Can you talk about your confidence level in your forecast?","Marie Ziegler ","At this stage of the game, this is our best forecast. And remember that cash receipts is a function of quantity, which will be very good this year, in addition to price. And I think perhaps some aren\u2019t focusing as much on the quantity.","Operator","The next question comes from Jerry Revich. And please state your company name. ","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs ","Can you just say more about the factory productivity improvement we saw in the quarter in ag and turf, as you\u2019ve finished the interim tier 4 transition. It sounds like you\u2019re starting to get significantly improved productivity. Does that continue into the fourth quarter? And then just help us get a sense for the relative complexity of now transitioning to tier 4 final again compared to the transition that you just went through on interim tier 4.","Tony Huegel ","As it relates to productivity, when you think about fourth quarter, keep in mind, as we talked about in the opening comments, we do have a very tough compare. Part of productivity, of course, is volumes as well, and last year our factories were running at relatively high levels, especially as it relates to the combine factory. And we would be at more normal levels this year. And so you\u2019ll see a little bit of a change there in a year over year basis.","Of course, as we move into final tier 4, that\u2019s largely going to impact certain quarters as we move into 2014. Combines, for example, will begin transitioning in January. I mentioned, or hinted at at least a little earlier, that our 8R tractors will transition in the April timeframe. And so we\u2019ll go through those transitions very similar to what we had in 2010, and so we\u2019ll have some quarter over quarter disruption as we go through the year.","Marie Ziegler ","Maybe just the other thing, in the fourth quarter, in selected products, we will start the transition, or we\u2019ll start the factory prep, so there will be a little bit of impact. But nonetheless, there\u2019s been a real focus on the high quality execution you\u2019ve come to expect from Deere and you\u2019re seeing that in our results.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs ","And in terms of the production schedule into the fourth quarter, and maybe Marie, part of it is what you mentioned a moment ago, but the sequential decline is the biggest we\u2019ve seen since \u201906, fourth quarter versus third quarter, how much of that is tier 4 final transition versus other factors. Just help us understand the sequential move, and obviously you explained it on a year over year basis. I\u2019m just trying to understand the sequential drivers.","Marie Ziegler ","Maybe the most important thing is to remember that last year we shifted $350 million of shipments out of the third quarter into the fourth quarter. And probably over talked about combines. And so that is probably the single biggest factor. There will be some adjustments here and there, but that\u2019s really the biggest.","Operator","The next question comes from David Raso. And please state your company name.","David Raso - ISI Group ","I just needed some clarification on the order book. For what\u2019s in the order book in those time periods you gave us, those are largely all non final tier 4? They\u2019re interim tier 4?","Tony Huegel ","That would be correct. We are announcing our final tier 4 product actually this week. The new product introduction shows begin, and will be over the next couple of weeks. And then we\u2019ll be announcing pricing and opening the order book to final tier 4. So that is correct. It\u2019s interim tier 4 products.","David Raso - ISI Group ","And just trying to think about the pricing on the final tier 4, how it could be impacting the orders to get the remaining interim tier 4. What\u2019s been communicated on the pricing? What is built into your expectations on the pricing? And really trying to get a read on some of the order book strength.","Tony Huegel ","We have made no final tier 4 price announcements at this point. So we\u2019ve taken some small, on combines for example, price increases related to the interim tier 4 orders that we have early in fiscal \u201914, but we\u2019ve announced no final tier 4 price increases. Again, it would be a little premature to announce price increases before the actual product is announced. So those price increases will follow the introduction.","David Raso - ISI Group ","Would you characterize the order books as they stand, even with obviously some overtures out there, people speculating on the price increases, it\u2019s reflective of the current demand out there, you would not characterize it as any pull forward, getting in front of the final tier 4 price increases?","Tony Huegel ","Again, because we haven\u2019t announced them, I wouldn\u2019t speculate that direction. All we can point to is where the demand is at this point, and what we\u2019re seeing in our order book is a continued very strong demand level. Again, comparable or in some cases slightly better than what we saw a year ago at very strong levels. So that\u2019s about all we can say about that.","So with that, thank you, and we\u2019ll need to move to the next caller.","Operator","The next question comes from Andy Casey. And please state your company name.","Andy Casey - Wells Fargo","Question on the Q3 ag and turf. If we could return to the margin performance, it was very good. Could you give the relative weighting for impact from volume productivity and material cost tailwinds, and stripping out the price and impairment charge?","Tony Huegel ","For ag and turf specifically, I don\u2019t know that I have that weighting. But as you look at the total cost of sales, obviously we talked about that ratio of price realization certainly helping benefit that ratio. Raw material costs would be the other positive, impacting the cost of sales in the quarter. But then you have overhead spend, you know, largely due to the higher employment costs, emissions costs, and some absorption as we had lower builds in inventory. And that\u2019s fiscal year numbers that I\u2019ve given you. Sorry about that. ","Raj Kalathur","If you look at the third quarter, price realization was one of the contributors to the operating profit improvement. Next to that was essentially our costs. This is the material costs. And then there were contributions from mix as well. So those would be the three that stand out, in that order.","Marie Ziegler ","And just a reminder, that water impairment is $50 million, on the negative side.","Andy Casey - Wells Fargo ","The reason I ask is if I strip out the impairment charge and the pricing, the incremental margin is still very strong, somewhere around 30%.","Marie Ziegler ","Last year\u2019s third quarter had inefficiencies, costs that we said for the ag and turf division were $50-75 million, which is something you need to bear in mind.","Raj Kalathur ","So to that extent, it was an easier compare as well.","Andy Casey - Wells Fargo ","Oh, okay. Thank you, that clears it up. And then the second question, just a question on Europe. There\u2019s some mixed signals coming out of there as you reflect in your forecast. You know, recent confidence indices turned positive within the ag side. Are you seeing any farmer concern about the revisions to the [CAP] subsidy package that are expected for next year?","Tony Huegel ","Not significant at all, and if you look at what\u2019s being proposed for CAP, if you look at it in nominal terms, the subsidies really are basically flat in terms of what the proposal is.","Marie Ziegler ","So so far, unlike other years, where there has been talk ahead of CAP changes, this has really been a, I hate to say nonevent, but has been very quiet.","Tony Huegel ","Very very minor changes.","Operator","The next question comes from Jamie Cook. And please state your company name.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse ","Two questions, and sorry to harp on the 2014 cash receipt forecast. But I guess can you just give color, when you guys have conversations with your dealers, or when the dealers are having conversations with the farmers, Marie, you point out that you have to look at the quantity and the crop price, but I think people are just concerned, optically, where, for example, corn prices are going, and if that will trump quantity. ","So can you talk about what they\u2019re saying about, just given where prices are, and you think that could potentially have a bigger impact on demand in 2014, just because of how we get to the actual cash receipt number?","And then my second question. Some of your peers have talked about a more competitive environment in construction, particularly seeing more discounting. I\u2019m just wondering if you could comment on what you\u2019re seeing in the industry.","Marie Ziegler ","Let me start with the cash receipts number. In our modeling, far and away the biggest driver and the highest correlation is cash receipts, and it doesn\u2019t discriminate between the commodity price and the quantity. So I will stop there. That is the biggest driver.","In terms of the construction market, since the market has, candidly, been softer than I think all expected, I\u2019m not surprised to hear that there\u2019s some conversation about dynamics in the market. But we certainly don\u2019t have any comments related to pricing and our construction equipment division is a solid contributor to the 3 points of price realization that we announced for the year, and certainly for the quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Rob Wertheimer. And please state your company name.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners ","Wanted to ask about the tier 4 final rollout. I gather you said you sold out the [stub] year on the combines. I guess you didn\u2019t try to run the factories extra hard, because I think you\u2019re implying combines are down year over year in Q4. Have you talked about whether you intend to do any extra tier 4 interim production as you roll on the various final things? And I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re able to give a rough guestimate of what your interim versus final production might be versus next year.","Tony Huegel ","We haven\u2019t discussed what the production levels would be in the kind of pre-final tier 4 production for combines in early fiscal 2014. I can tell you we are beginning the transition of combines in January. So you\u2019re really talking about the November-December production levels.","Marie Ziegler ","I think if your question was is there further upside, the answer is no.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners ","So you\u2019re sold out where you want to sold out, and you\u2019re done, and it\u2019s probably not running the factory as hard as last year, is what you said?","Marie Ziegler ","The run rates in the fourth quarter of last year were really not sustainable. That would be the bottom line. Not a way we would choose to run a business.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners ","And then second question, Tony, you mentioned the early order programs on the springtime product on intelligent planting. It\u2019s not something you guys have talked a lot about. Can you just kind of go through, mechanically, how that works? Is it a significant portion of the volume, or just an indicator? Obviously I assume that would have no connection whatsoever to tier 4 final stuff, so it would be an indicator of underlying strength, I guess.","Tony Huegel ","With the exception of sprayers, of course it would be final tier 4, effective. But when you look at the tillage and seeding and so on, and really the importance there is, we\u2019ve talked about this a little bit in the past, tillage tends to be a fairly good leading indicator, simply because it\u2019s a relatively discretionary item, and so for us internally, we view it as a good leading indicator. So it\u2019s more indicative of underlying strength more than the impact necessarily would have on the top line or bottom line.","Operator","The next question comes from [Mig] Dobre. And please state your company name.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird ","I guess I\u2019m wondering if maybe you can give us a little color on what you\u2019re hearing from dealers, and what you\u2019re seeing as far as used equipment prices, especially some of the newer models out there. We\u2019ve heard that there\u2019s been a little bit of softness, and if that\u2019s so, I\u2019m wondering how you think that impacts demand for equipment going forward.","Tony Huegel ","As we look at pricing on used equipment, what we\u2019d tell you is overall we\u2019re actually seeing pretty healthy levels of pricing on used equipment. You see plus or minus a little bit. So large tractors, pricing up a single digit. Combines, down a single digit. But again, at very, very strong levels. So we don\u2019t view that as an issue at this point.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird","And then looking at the R&D expenses, obviously much higher level than a couple of years ago, because of all the tier 4 related items. But I\u2019m wondering, as we\u2019re looking out today to 2014, given the higher base that you\u2019re currently operating on, should we continue to expect growth in this line item? Or is it fair to say that this level can actually account for a lot of the tier 4 final?","Tony Huegel ","At this point, I would not speculate on 2014 expenses. As we\u2019ve talked about, we don\u2019t provide guidance. There\u2019s some things maybe to consider. We aren\u2019t finished with final tier 4, so we still have a number of products to transition, both in the upcoming year and in the following. And keep in mind also that we are continuing to invest in growth, and in some cases that\u2019s investing in new products in certain key markets. So that\u2019s about all we can say really at this point related to R&D. ","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Fisher. And please state your company name.","Steven Fisher - UBS","Wondering if you can just give us your thoughts on how the special depreciation benefits might play out over the next several months, how any debate might impact near term sales. And then just kind of remind us how that played out for you guys last year.","Tony Huegel ","There\u2019s two separate items. There\u2019s a Section 179 that can be utilized with used equipment as well as new, and of course the bonus depreciation. Both are subject to the task reform development. ","You know, as it looks at Section 179, it appears that there is much broader support for Section 179 in terms of speculation that it may or may not be extended, then included in proposals, even to make it permanent, through some of the small business tax reform proposals, those sorts of things. Certainly as you move toward the end of the year, especially Section 179 we think has been helpful in moving used equipment in the past. ","We would tell you while bonus depreciation is certainly beneficial, we think it\u2019s had a marginal benefit on sales. There\u2019s a number of other factors beyond tax considerations that farmers consider. Last year would be a good example, and you mentioned that. As we approach the end of 2012, of course, the expectation both internally and by most externally was that the bonus depreciation would not be extended. Section 179 actually had already dropped. The change at the end of the year made it retroactive. ","And we did not see any impact in our order book once availability went beyond December 31, which, again, in our view, kind of lends credibility to our view that at least last year the expectation that the bonus depreciation would be eliminated did not impact our order volumes.","Operator","The next question comes from Eli Lustgarten. And please state your company name.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research ","We\u2019ll come back to ag in a minute, but can we talk about what\u2019s going on in the construction equipment sector? You went from down 8 to down 11. Is that because of weaker end markets, or more inventory liquidation that is required. [unintelligible] inventory liquidation as part of it in this quarter, so we can think of it more normalizing in the next year and maybe quantify how much of the downturn is that.","Marie Ziegler ","We would say that it\u2019s both. Clearly the market has been weaker than we had anticipated, and we are continuing to reduce some of our inventory. We would expect to have that completed by the end of this year, so that we would go into next year poised for what we hope will be a stronger market outlook based on at least the market fundamentals.","Tony Huegel ","And I want to make a clarification. You said down 8 to down 11. Our forecast today is down 8. It was previously down 5.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research ","But how much of that is inventory liquidation?","Marie Ziegler ","I don\u2019t have that. I don\u2019t know, half and half?","Tony Huegel ","And again, keep in mind that they go hand in hand. As we\u2019ve gone through the year, as we\u2019ve seen the sales expectations decrease, of course our dealers are seeing that as well, and making the appropriate level of inventory reduction throughout the year. So you know, as sales expectations come down, you\u2019re going to see an additional reduction in inventory, generally speaking, on our dealers.","Raj Kalathur ","The other thing I\u2019ll add is, as the lead times are getting lower, dealers have an incentive for holding less inventory as well. So that\u2019s also contributing to lower inventory in the channel.","Marie Ziegler ","Maybe I could just cite one positive note that we are seeing, is that our rental utilization is really up and high, and that can be a leading indicator. We\u2019ll see how that plays out, but it\u2019s been exceptionally high.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research ","And a quick follow on. Can you talk about combine schedules? We\u2019re hearing from dealers about a buildup of used goods at dealers, a 30% cut in allocations by Deere for combines in the fourth quarter for next year. Can you talk about what\u2019s going on in that market in the fourth quarter as you\u2019re looking out?","Marie Ziegler ","The early part of the year, when you look at what allocations may or may not be, that is really not a good predictor of what the future holds. We start very conservatively. Recall that we are in the midst of a transition as you think about 2014, a fairly significant transition for our combine lines. So things are going to be parsed out over the course of the year in contrast to a traditional early order program where you really have your full year\u2019s number of slots available. ","Tony Huegel ","The only thing I would add is certainly there are a high level of used combines in the marketplace, but it\u2019s really reflective of the high level of sales that we\u2019ve had in the last couple of years. And as you look at the sales increase over the last several months, new sales is much higher than what we\u2019ve seen increased on a percentage basis in used combine levels. So while high, we\u2019re moving into a very key period of sales for used equipment, and are confident with our dealer network as well as the pool fund strategy that we use, that we\u2019re in a good position to be able to move those used combines and other used equipment as well, out.","Operator","The next question comes from Larry DeMaria. And please state your company name.","Larry DeMaria - William Blair ","Not to harp on the crop receipts, but obviously you guys don\u2019t believe the USDA numbers from the other day as well, that they\u2019re understated, because you\u2019re forecasting bigger yields on similar harvested acres, which implies obviously a much bigger production and bigger carryout. Similar in soybeans. I think you carry out over 10% versus 16% for corn going out for next year. But you kept the price very similar to the USDA, the same in corn and slightly lower in soybeans. ","So that\u2019s the delta that I think we\u2019re all worried about. Can you just justify and explain why the price hasn\u2019t gone down that you\u2019re expecting, but the production levels you guys put forth are much higher? ","Tony Huegel ","Keep in mind there\u2019s a large number of factors that go into each of those, and into the price, and I would also point out that our forecast did not change based on the USDA numbers that were recently reported. That was put together prior to the release of that data, and the basis for our forecast. So again, you have a lot of factors. You have exports, so on and so forth, in there. ","The other thing I would point out is there\u2019s a lot of conversation about the $4.90 corn. You know, if you look back historically, that is still very strong pricing for corn. Certainly down from last year, but keep in mind that last year\u2019s price was very high coming off of very low production due to the drought. ","And so $4.90 corn, from the information we get, from Informa Economics, is still very supportive for farmers. We would tell you, according to Informa, that low $4 corn, farmers are still making good money. So at $4.90, still profitable levels for most farmers.","Larry DeMaria - William Blair","Okay, so it says August 14 in the slide, but this date is not\u2026","Tony Huegel ","Those are a Deere estimate as of that date.","Larry DeMaria - William Blair ","Okay. And so I\u2019ll stick with the order books. You mentioned the seasonal orders for planters, etc. were flat, I think, year over year. And last year it was up 15%. Have orders come in strongly over the last few weeks to get you there? Because it seems like initially they were behind. And then just more broadly, the slide in corn that we\u2019ve seen, what kind of effect did that have on orders more recently, in the last four to six weeks?","Tony Huegel ","What I would tell you is we look at this as a snapshot, and don\u2019t get down into the details of the week to week changes. What we can tell you is that at this point we are relatively flat year over year, to your point, at very very high levels last year. And again, the early order program, it\u2019s early in the year, but those indicators are very strong. And as well, look at the tractor order book, which is equally as strong, that we\u2019re seeing out into 2014.","Operator","The next question comes from Adam Fleck. And please state your company name.","Adam Fleck - Morningstar ","I had a couple of questions on Russia specifically. You commented, I think, last quarter, that you wanted to see what happened with the import duties. It looks like they were extended. So that being the case, can you just update us on your plans for the strategy there and localized content?","Raj Kalathur ","Yes, it was extended. And the indications are it will probably carry on at least a few months, if not a couple more years. One of the things we are doing is to look at how we can organize our operations in Russia to qualify for less of a tariff or wider tariffs. So right now we do, say, in SKD assembly, some of the considerations we would have for CKD assembly. So those are the types of changes we would be looking at, and that varies by the product and the volumes that would justify for that particular product category.","So those should allow us to improve our volumes in that share, but as you said, directionally this is going to be an impact on us.","Tony Huegel ","The only thing I would add is keep in mind it certainly creates some short term challenges for us, but from a long term perspective, we remain very committed to that market. We continue to see a lot of strong opportunity there. ","Adam Fleck - Morningstar ","And then just one follow up. Something that maybe doesn\u2019t get discussed too much, but can you just disclose what your parts sales are to date? Are those up pretty substantially?","Tony Huegel ","We don\u2019t disclose today. What we would tell you is in past years parts tend to run 15-20% of our total sales. But beyond that, we can\u2019t go into more detail.","Operator","The next question comes from Annual Duignan. And please state your company name.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan ","I just wanted to go back to the cash receipts discussion. Not to beat a dead horse or anything, but would you at least agree that we have probably passed the peak of cash receipts in that farmers are likely to grow more corn, not only this year but next year? And cash receipts probably, we don\u2019t see corn at $7 again, unless we get another significant weather event in the next few years?","Marie Ziegler ","Ann, this is our best estimate. We are not soothsaying into the future. But I don\u2019t see anything that necessarily precludes prices from going up further. We know we have very strong demand conditions. You have the USDA increasing seed and residual use. You do have a slight bump on ethanol. We see good demand in the market. And so I can\u2019t concede that. On the other hand, I can\u2019t guarantee anything in the future other than the fundamental tailwinds for our business continue to look very strong.","Raj Kalathur ","If you look at the fundamental tailwinds of demand for ag commodities, it is very strong. It\u2019s continuing to be very strong. And that\u2019s a primary driver. So weather may impact it one year to the next, but the fundamental drivers of demand are still in place, and that\u2019s going to drive our business here and [unintelligible].","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan ","And back to the construction side, you just said that build-ready lots are dwindling. Could you explain what you mean by that? And how do you gather that data?","Marie Ziegler ","Anecdotally we\u2019re hearing that. Actually, we picked that up in our interviews with senior officers on multiple fronts. And what that means for us specifically is that a lot of the usage of our equipment in residential is when you are moving land to prepare the lots, to put in the street, to get the sewer into the division. So the fact that you see lower number of build ready lots, so to speak, may be a positive indicator as you move into the future, that there will be increased demand for the equipment in use.","Raj Kalathur ","Essentially you can think of this is vertical or horizontal constructions. What uses more of our equipment is when you set up a completely new subdivision and have residential construction and commercial construction around it. So right now, early on, after the downturn, all the build-ready lots are being taken up, and ones that are no more of these build ready lots, which is what we\u2019re hearing more of, there are going to be more constructions on complete new subdivisions. That\u2019s what we meant by that.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan ","Yeah, and I appreciate that. We\u2019ve written extensively about that, but I was just wondering how we get that data and kind of figure out when we switch from kind of brownfield to greenfield. But you\u2019re just hearing it anecdotally, that\u2019s what I\u2019m reading?","Tony Huegel ","Correct.","Operator","The next question comes from Ashish Gupta.","Ashish Gupta - CLSA ","Can you give us a sense of what levers you might be able to pull in a down market? Maybe what type of decremental margins you can manage towards?","Marie Ziegler ","I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been very specific. Each single product line, each department within the company, has a specific set of activities that as we move up or down we either cease or add. So it varies by product line, by department.","Raj Kalathur ","If you look at our construction equipment business, lower end demand, lower market demand were the case in the third quarter. But if you look at how we\u2019ve performed in terms of whether it\u2019s R&D or SG&A, and overall margin environment, was impressive. So regardless of the end market environment, we are in a position to actually pull different levers or ramp up if necessary to meet those conditions. And that\u2019s what you saw in the construction case in the third quarter.","Ashish Gupta - CLSA ","And are you still in a position where you\u2019re continuing to add headcount to facilitate future growth in the different global regions?","Marie Ziegler ","I\u2019d say the bulk of the headcount really occurred in the last couple of years. I\u2019m not actually, candidly, sure where we are year to date. But I don\u2019t anticipate there would be a lot, other than perhaps in Brazil, where we\u2019re approaching the startup of those factories there. And maybe in China as well. ","Raj Kalathur ","So [unintelligible] in \u201910, \u201911, \u201912 were higher than in \u201913, so most of our investments have come in, or towards our aspirations that we have expressed outside [unintelligible] aspirations.","Operator","The final question comes from Seth Weber. And please state your company name.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets ","On capital allocation, it looked like your share repurchase actually picked up here in the quarter. Are you kind of moving that up in the pecking order? How should we think about share repo going forward? Or is it just you were being more opportunistic here in the quarter, or something like that?","Marie Ziegler ","Well, our pecking order, per se, has not changed, and we\u2019ve long articulated maintaining a strong balance sheet, invest in the business, return dividends, and then excess cash would be used for share repurchase. We were very specific in the first and second quarters that we were conservative going into those because of the fiscal cliff in the first quarter, and then some residual shakiness, if you will, in the market as we went into the second quarter.","As our cash flow has proven out, as we\u2019re through our peak use of cash - remember we are big users of cash in the first and second quarters - as our stock has continued to provide us with a very good buying opportunity - we think we\u2019re significantly below our intrinsic value - we were able to step up the share repurchase. ","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets ","So as we look to 2014, do you think your capex number, the $1.3 billion for this year, should come down, and that gives you some more firepower? ","Marie Ziegler ","I think it\u2019s unlikely. We don\u2019t have a forecast for \u201914 yet. Obviously we\u2019re working on some plans. But remember there is still a significant amount of work to be done with final tier 4 ahead of us. We won\u2019t see as much in the way of new plant investments. A lot of that is behind us. But there\u2019s a lot ahead of us, in a concentrated period, to meet final tier 4.","Tony Huegel ","And we have said that at least out through 2014, that that $1.3 billion is probably a good at least short or midterm run rate to anticipate. And then beyond that, as a percentage of sales, we would expect to see capex start to come down. But depending on where our sales are, you may or may not see the absolute number come down at that point.","In conclusion, our strong performance continued in the third quarter of 2013, with earnings up 26% on a 4% sales increase, and we\u2019re well on our way to another year of impressive performance. With that, we thank you for your participation in the call, and as always, we\u2019ll be available the rest of the day to answer any additional questions you may have.

We're benefitting from the sound execution of our operating plans, the strength of our broad product portfolio and the steps we've taken to bring down structural cost. As a result of all these factors, we have raised our forecast and are now calling for significantly higher earnings for the full year.","Now let's take a closer look at our second quarter results, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were up 5% to $8.287 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $802 million. EPS was $2.49 in the quarter. On Slide 4, total worldwide Equipment Operations net sales were up 2% to $7.26 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation did not have a material impact in the quarter.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were up 1% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, primarily due to price realization. Operating profit was $1.003 billion, up from 614 million last year, a result of more favorable sales mix, price realization and the favorable effects of currency exchange. The quarter also benefited from a gain on the sale of a partial interest in SiteOne Landscape Supply, Inc., which contributed about 3 points of operating margin. For more details regarding the transaction, please see the notes in today's earnings release. Operating margins were 17.3% for the quarter. Excluding the SiteOne impact, operating margins were about 3.5 points higher than last year's second quarter.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Following a forecasted about 5% reduction in 2016 cash receipts, we expect 2017 total cash receipts plus government payments to be about $367 billion. This is roughly flat with 2016 as declines in meat animals and food grains cash receipts mostly offset gains in dairy and cotton cash receipts.","On Slide 7, record soybean and corn production from South America is expected in 2016-2017. Global grain and oilseeds stocks-to-use ratios are forecast to remain at elevated but generally unchanged levels in 2016-2017 as abundant crops are mostly offset by strong demand around the world. Chinese grain stocks continued to increase in 2016 with supply, domestic production plus imports, outpacing demand. Chinese stocks of grains now represent almost half of the world's stock. Remember, these Chinese stocks are unlikely to be exported. That means the world market remains sensitive to major production setbacks, geopolitical disruptions or trade disputes.","Our economic outlook for the EU28 is on Slide 8. Economic growth in the region is improving, though geopolitical risks remain elevated. Variable farm income remains below the long-term average due to high global grain stocks and last year's core harvest. However, conditions appear to be bottoming out in 2017. The dairy market is recovering with prices at normal levels and forecast for margins moving above the five-year average. Meanwhile, sentiment for dairy farmers is improving and remains positive for beef and pork producers. Note that nearly half of EU farm incomes are derived from dairy and livestock.","Shifting to Brazil on Slide 9, the chart on the left displays the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for health of agri business in Brazil. Ag production is expected to increase about 9% in 2017 in U.S. dollar terms due to record acreage expansion and yield expectations. In local currency, the value of production is forecast to be up about 1%. Brazilian farmers, since they sell their crops in U.S. dollars, remain solidly profitable.","On the right side of the slide, you will see eligible rates for ag-related government sponsored finance programs. Rate for Moderfrota remain at 8.5% for small and midsize farmers and 10.5% for large farmers. Importantly, the overall budget for Moderfrota has been raised again by about R$1 billion to R$8.55 billion in total. This demonstrates the government's ongoing commitment to agriculture and continues to improve farmer confidence. Despite the current political uncertainty, news on the 2017-2018 harvest plan is still anticipated in the coming weeks for the budget year that begins in July.","Our 2017 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 10. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are now forecast to be down about 5%, with a slight improvement in both large and small models of equipment. As noted previously, it does appear the large ag market is stabilizing. Signs supporting the stabilization include a considerably lower rate of industry sales decline in 2017 versus the past two years and a used equipment environment that is more supportive of sales.","The EU industry outlook is now flat to down 5% in 2017. While there is improved sentiment in the region due to higher dairy and livestock margins, low crop prices and farm incomes as well as geopolitical risks continue to weigh on the market. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be up about 20% in 2017. Positive industry sentiment in Brazil and Argentina continue to drive this improvement. Shifting to Asia, sales are expected to be flat to up slightly, with growth in India being the main driver. Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in U.S. and Canada are projected to be roughly flat in 2017.","Putting this all together, on Slide 11, fiscal year 2017 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be up about 8% versus 2016, driven largely by growth in our overseas markets. Our Ag & Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 11.5% in 2017. The implied incremental margin for the year is about 43%, or around 35% without the impact of SiteOne and the voluntary employee separation program. In comparison with last quarter's forecast, the changes driven by sales improvements in all of our main geographies, including large ag in North America, and results in about 45% incremental margin net of the SiteOne impact.","Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 12. Net sales were up 7% in the quarter as a result of higher shipment volumes and price realization, partially offset by higher warranty costs. Operating profit was $108 million for the quarter, up from $74 million last year. The increase was driven by higher shipment volumes and price realization. These factors were partially offset by higher warranty costs and a less favorable sales mix. Operating margins were 7.4% in the quarter, about 2 points higher than last year's second quarter. The division's incremental margin was about 35%.","Moving to Slide 13, the economic fundamentals affecting the Construction & Forestry industries in North America are cause for optimism. GDP growth is positive, job growth continues, construction spending is up from 2016 levels, and housing starts are expected to exceed 1.25 million units this year. Construction investment was up in the first quarter of 2017 by almost 10%, led by rebounding oil and gas and residential activities. Commercial and institutional construction activity continued to increase moderately. Machinery rental utilization rates have improved after two years of deterioration and used inventory has come down in the past quarter. All in all, our outlook reflects a strong order book as well as what we've seen in the way of retail sales growth over the last three months.","Moving to the C&F outlook on Slide 14, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be up about 13% in 2017 with no material currency impact. The forecast for global forestry markets is down about 5%, a result of lower sales in U.S. and Canada. C&F's full-year operating margin is now projected to be about 6%, with an implied incremental margin of about 24%.","Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 15 shows the provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. At the end of April, the annualized provision for credit losses was 18 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2017 shown on the slide contemplates a loss provision of about 28 basis points, slightly lower than the previous forecast. This will put losses just above the 10-year average of 26 basis points and below the 15-year average of 34 points.","Moving to Slide 16, worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $103.5 million in the second quarter versus $102.6 million last year. The improvement was primarily due to lower operating lease losses and impairments, largely offset by less favorable financing spreads and higher SA&G. Financial Services 2017 net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $475 million, down slightly from our previous forecast due to higher SA&G, mainly for incentive compensation.","Slide 17 outlines receivables and inventories. For the Company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $363 million due to reductions in the Ag & Turf division. We expect to end 2017 with total receivables and inventories up about $400 million, with increases in both the Ag & Turf and C&F divisions. The increases are consistent with higher sales in both divisions.","Slide 18 shows cost of sales as a percent of net sales. Cost of sales for the second quarter was 75%. Our 2017 cost of sales guidance is about 77% of net sales, an improvement of about 1 point from last quarter. When modeling 2017, keep in mind the unfavorable impacts of emissions cost, voluntary separation expenses, incentive compensation and raw material prices. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point, savings related to the voluntary employee separation program, and a favorable sales mix.","Now let's look at some additional details. With respect to R&D expense on Slide 19, R&D was down 6% in the second quarter. Our 2017 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1%. Moving to Slide 20, SA&G expense for the Equipment Operations was up 8% in the second quarter, with the main drivers being incentive compensation and commissions paid to dealers. Our 2017 forecast calls for SA&G expense to be up by about 7%. Roughly two-thirds of the full-year change is expected to come from incentive compensation, voluntary separation expenses and commissions paid to dealers. Turning to Slide 21, the Equipment Operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter. For 2017, the full-year effective tax rate forecast is now in the range of 32% to 34%. Slide 22 shows our Equipment Operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the Equipment Operations is now forecast to be about $3.1 billion in 2017.","The Company's financial outlook is on Slide 23. Net sales for the third quarter are forecast to be up about 18% compared to 2016. Our full year outlook now calls for net sales to be up about 9%, which includes about 1 point of price realization. Finally, our full-year 2017 net income forecast is now about $2 billion.","In closing, with this recent performance, John Deere has demonstrated a continued ability to produce impressive results through all phases of the business cycle. This kind of resilience illustrates our success, finding ways to operate more efficiently and develop a wider range of revenue sources. It shows something else too. The impact of the consistent investments we've made in advanced technology, new products and additional markets. Actions such as these are leading to strong performance in 2017. What's more, they support our conviction that John Deere is well-positioned to deliver significant value to our customers and investors over the long-term.","Tony Huegel","Thank you, Josh. We're now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. But in consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We do have our first question. It's from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Jerry, your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Tony, the margin performance this quarter came despite warranty costs that were a headwind here. I'm wondering if you could talk about what's been driving the higher quality cost for you folks over the past two years compared to history and over what time frame would you expect warranties to return to the low 2% range that's more typical for you folks in the past?","Tony Huegel","That was something certainly that was cited in the press release, both for Equipment Operations and construction specifically. Just I think I'd remind people as to start with, with Tier 4 emissions requirements, we had a significant number of new product introductions coming very, very rapidly, and more rapidly than you intend to see. So the cycle of new products tended to ramp up, and you're starting to see a little bit of the effects of that. And to that point, we're not talking about significant challenges with a product r a couple of products, it's here and there smaller warranty costs that just accumulate a bit.","The other thing I'd remind everyone is we do have slightly higher warranty costs related to the change we made in our parts warranty experience. So, we extended the warranty period for parts and that does come at a little bit higher cost. Some of that also specific to construction when you think about the warranty costs this quarter, some of the year-over-year compare, and specifically again for that division, there were some favorable adjustments last year, slightly favorable, and so the compare was a little more challenging for them. So those are really some of the key reasons.","Jerry Revich","And sorry, Tony, over what timeframe would you expect the performance to return to more difficult levels?","Tony Huegel","You will continue to see that get better. Now keep in mind you're going to see that occasionally especially in some of the earlier quarters of a year there's always risk because the numbers are relatively small, but certainly that is a key focus that we have as a company to continue to improve the warranty experience primarily for our customers, the quality experience. So I would expect over the next fairly short period of time, you'll see those things changing pretty rapidly.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Fisher of UBS Securities. Steven, your line is open.","Steve Fisher","A bigger picture question on the ag cycle. We're now again forecasting growth in your ag business and starting to raise some of the regional forecast. How are you thinking about the shape of the ag recovery from here assuming that the crop forecast that you have play out as expected and things develop in South America as you are thinking?","Tony Huegel","I think the latter part of your question is important to keep in mind. I mean at this point it's still very, very early, especially as you think about Northern Hemisphere, crops and so on. That will make obviously a pretty large impact in terms of how we see the future. But if you assume current fundamentals, current assumptions, where you have normal weather, candidly if you look at our forecast, you're not seeing significant changes in the outlook, underlying fundamentals for our farmer customer, not a lot of change in crop prices. But I think what you are seeing today is the impact of a stabilization.","And so, while you aren't necessarily, it's hard to argue today for a significant recovery in commodity prices and so on, we're also largely not anticipating significant reductions, and so as farmers adjust to that, we are starting to see some of them stepping in a bit more into the market and beginning some replacement of their equipment. Again, I would say it's more about stabilization and the change that that drives in the mindset of the farmer customer.","Now there are exceptions to that. Obviously you go to Brazil and today anyway we are seeing some very strong recovery. That's a farmer customer who has stayed relatively profitable through this downturn and as a result they are in a strong financial position. As we have seen in prior months some of the uncertainty and political environment stabilizing in Brazil, we certainly saw some very, very strong recovery there.","Obviously in the last week there's, there's been the last few days some uncertainty injected back into that market. We'll see where that goes in terms of both the uncertainty that's currently there, does that stay or the things stabilize again a bit, and then what impact that may or may not have on our customers' buying decisions. But largely, outside of Brazil, South America, I would argue you're really just seeing stabilization and some uptick in demand as a result of that.","Operator","Our next question is from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse Securities. Jamie, your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Nice quarter. Tony, I guess the margin performance in the ag business even ex SiteOne was pretty impressive, and I understand you're guiding ex SiteOne to sort of mid-40s incremental margins but it does implies the incrementals in the back half of the year sort of fall off. So I'm just wondering, given how early we are in the cycle, why the implied incremental margins deteriorate in the back half of the year, is it we're being conservative, is it \u2013 or can you talk to the headwinds that are implied in that margin target?","Tony Huegel","Sure. I think as you think about margin, and specifically for ag, there's a number of different ways you can kind of slice it and look at it. Now if you look at absolute margins in the back half of the year, and again there are a lot of moving pieces in our numbers, because unlike some others we don't strip out a bunch of stuff in our reporting, we do pure GAAP reporting, but specifically if you look at just some of those one-time charges and eliminate things like SiteOne, things like the voluntary separation charges, the margin we've had in the first half of the year on ag has been about 2 points. If you look at the guide for the back half of the year, it's consistent. We're about a 2 point improved margin ex those one-time items again in the back half of the year. So again, I think that's pretty consistent.","Remember if you think about too on the overall forecast, and here I need to be very clear, I'm not talking about the incremental change from first quarter, but if you look at the full year forecast as it is, you're starting to see some benefit from some of the large ag products, but overall you're still seeing not as attractive of a mix in those margins and in that forecast, and that's part of why you're seeing the margins where they are. While still very strong in the back half of the year, you're just not seeing quite as strong as maybe what some would have anticipated or what we would anticipate if it was driven by large ag. And so that's really some of the key differences.","Operator","Our next question is from David Raso from Evercore ISI. David, your line is open.","David Raso","On the conversation around the retail outlook kind of post this year, I was just curious how you're thinking about replacement demand. If you look at the appendix, you have projections for 2017 and 2018 when it comes to corn prices and acres and so forth. That seemed pretty consistent with USDA and it really doesn't imply any cash receipt growth next year, but you mentioned the idea of replacement demand stabilization. At this outlook, would you expect retail in the U.S. to be up next year with these crop fundamentals?","Rajesh Kalathur","David, I mean I think if you note where our working capital receivables and inventory forecasts are for the end of the year, I think it's appropriate to assume that next year is going to be up.","David Raso","Okay, so that's \u2013 I was trying to read that into the idea of you've been able to raise your view of inventory and receivables in the channel as well as an ag, not just construction. So, we can take that as a sign of confidence that you feel better about the retail environment in 2018 from what we have learned the last few months in stabilization, replacement and all that. Is that a fair assessment?","Tony Huegel","It's certainly the sustainability of what we're seeing beginning to occur today.","Rajesh Kalathur","And we don't want to get into a 2018 forecast, David, but I think the statement that we have in terms of the shift in our thinking in terms of working capital at the end of the year should give you a good idea.","David Raso","I think that earnings power you are putting up with very little retail help and the ability to grow next year again without much crop health just emboldens investors to feel, look, if I can catch any lightening in a bottle on grain prices, that's all upside and along the way you're still growing earnings to the upside surprise. So again, we do feel retail can grow with this backdrop of the commodity environment. Just want to make sure I'm thinking about that right.","Rajesh Kalathur","David, I think that's a good point. Now if you look at a longer-term global demand for commodities still going up, and if you look at the USDA in our 2017-18 production forecast, it's lower, which means stock-to-use you're saying is likely to come down, and equilibrium, all we will say is the equilibrium is getting tighter. Now, we haven't put in our projections any disruption to the production for commodities, but if any of those should come up, there is even further upside, you are right.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Shlisky from Seaport Global Securities. Michael, your line is open.","Michael Shlisky","I want to follow up on David's question there and maybe point to a different slide in your appendix. 22nd slide you outlined U.S. foreign debt level is at the highest level that we've seen in the last 15 years here in 2017. So Raj, just trying to get a feel for the kind of upsize you might be seeing next year. You guys said that farmer is going to have to start paying down soon their debt first before buying anything major going forward, whether it's this year or next, and is that kind of what we're kind of waiting for? If farmer incomes turn upward, would paying down debt be the first thing that they do and then turn towards buying any kind of machinery?","Tony Huegel","That's always the question and I think the thing to point out is easy to point that the debt levels have risen, but again, I think we would point to from an historic perspective farmers are still in much better shape than what they would have been previously. And certainly, if you continue at these kinds of levels, you'll continue to see those creep up a bit as we have. But we don't view that as a significant risk certainly at this point.","And I think what you're seeing today, and the buying behavior of customers maybe answers that question for you, we're starting to see them step back in and place those orders and see those retails moving up a bit, even in this environment. Again, I think I want to separate that from a significant recovery type of conversation versus it's the effects of seeing stabilization for our farmer customers and their willingness now to step in, at least modestly, step back in and begin to think about some replacement. All right, so let's go ahead and move on to the next caller.","Operator","Our next question is from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan Securities. Ann, your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Just on the fundamentals again, if we look at what's happened in Brazil in the last week or so or even in the last few days, we saw significant farmers selling their crops, both beans and corn, down there and that weighed on bean prices and corn prices as recently as yesterday. Can you just talk about what's happening in Brazil, farmers now selling products, what impact that could have on U.S. exports as we move into the next marketing year and how that could weigh on the outlook for cash receipts for U.S. farmers going forward?","Tony Huegel","I think obviously what transpired over the last couple of days is still very fresh and impacts our \u2013 I'll say uncertain at this point to how long does it last, those sorts of things. Largely I think that when you think about the selling from Brazilian farmers, I mean outside of the last couple of days, it was pretty clear that they had been holding onto those crops looking for better price, and I think most forecast we're anticipating that they would at some point need to sell them and that they would be exported. So, I'm not sure it will have a significant impact necessarily on the broader export assumptions, either for Brazil or for the U.S. But certainly the timing of those got pulled up pretty considerably.","Now the good news to that is, with the FX and the reason farmers are leasing that with the FX changes, it's bringing a lot of cash into those farmer pockets again, and they are seeing some benefit in the short-term from the FX change. So, that would be at least one positive that you could potentially point to for our Brazilian customers, and again, at least in the short-term. But it's early and the overall impact we'll have to wait and keep our eye on it as things move forward.","Rajesh Kalathur","And to add to Tony's point, we look at the soybean prices, the current prices, you're right they are down, because of the additional soybean coming into the market from Brazil, but if you look at the futures, number futures, they haven't changed much. So that should help with what Tony just said.","And then if you look at the longer-term, since you brought up Brazil, longer-term ag export is very critical to Brazil and for their foreign exchange, and historically you have seen a government's, regardless of the party, support to ag sector very well. And while there is uncertainty, we cannot say what's likely to happen, and if you look at the past and if you look at what is good for Brazil, we see them continuing to support the ag sector.","Operator","Our next question is from Neil Frohnapple from Longbow Research. Neil, your line is open.","Neil Frohnapple","Within the Construction business, could you provide more granularity on the positive price realization in the quarter, so as the competitive pressures ease, particularly in light of the higher sales outlook for the year, and just thoughts on whether you think you have turned the corner on this and what the outlook is from here?","Tony Huegel","That's a good question and I would tell you the positive price realization in the quarter was really more about last year versus this year. You may recall second quarter last year we had a pretty substantial accrual change as we increased incentive going into the market and had to then again change the accrual we had for product that had previously been sold, shipped to dealers but not retail sold. And so the compare I would say was a pretty easy compare and that was driving that positive price year-over-year.","I would not say we have turned the corner. I would not say things have gotten less competitive in that market. In fact, if you look at our fiscal year guidance, really very little change, and we would continue to see kind of flattish to slightly negative price realization for Construction for the year. So again, that was more about a quarter impact, really no change in the annual guide there.","Operator","Our next question is from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank Securities. Nicole, your line is open.","Nicole DeBlase","So my question was just on the cadence of the rest of the year. So based on the outlook for the third quarter, the up 18% for Equipment Ops, the math I'm getting is that 4Q looks kind of flattish year-on-year, and first, is that completely wrong, and then second is what's driving the significant deceleration, is it just tougher comps in Brazil or is there something else that we need to be thinking about?","Tony Huegel","Yes, and you're looking at it for the Company versus\u2026?","Nicole DeBlase","Yes, for the total Equipment Ops for the year.","Tony Huegel","The total Equipment Ops, if you look at fourth quarter, we would have it up a little bit. But keep in mind fourth quarter is a pretty light quarter, and remember versus last year too actually pretty easy compare, especially as it relates to ag. And I guess shifting for both ag and construction, pretty significant underproduction in the fourth quarter. You'll see underproduction as you typically would as we move into the end of the year. But again, it would be up slightly in the fourth quarter.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay. But I guess since last year the comp is easy, like could there be some conservatism baked into there is what I'm getting at, just seems kind of\u2026","Tony Huegel","Yes, I mean all of those that you're seeing are ending inventories or receivables and inventory is, you can see in our guidance, is up. And so there's certainly some benefit there. But again, the percentage change in the fourth quarter, because we're coming off, the dollars may not be as impactful as the percentage in terms of the changes is what I would say there.","Rajesh Kalathur","The percentage for Q4 is closer to 16%. If you just take the 9% for the full year, that's what it would work out to.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Wertheimer from Barclays Capital. Robert, your line is open.","Robert Wertheimer","My question, you guys sometimes come on this, not terribly specifically, but it's basically production versus retail, so your industry guidance is obviously industry equipment guidance and it's kind of in Ag & Turf kind of flattish and your revenues are up substantially. And so between those two numbers can be parts, can be market share, can be reversal of path on a production, can be over-production, [indiscernible] over the next year. So I'm just a little curious, are you able to say where you're producing this year versus retail and whether it's over or under and whether you have share gain factored in?","Tony Huegel","Sure. I mean, yes, there is some share gain factored in. Again, I'd be a little careful to speaking very broadly versus specific products. If you think about large ag for example, certainly versus last year where we were under-producing retail, this year we would be at or in a pretty much at retail. So year-over-year you're getting a sales lift because we are not under-producing.","I would say, really construction, if you look just broadly at construction equipment last year's significant under-production and this year we're actually over producing to retail. So dealers are building inventory some in the channel. So you get kind of a double benefit there, but I'd say the greater benefit is similar to large ag, the fact that we're not under-producing this year.","Now if you look at some of the other product, it's going to be a mix here and there based on where we ended last year, how we view current year and then looking out into next year, but small ag for example in the U.S. you'd see a bit of under-production. But obviously, overall you're seeing some overproduction as our receivables and inventory numbers are going up slightly. But again, I wouldn't read too much into that.","Operator","Our next question is from Ross Gilardi of Bank of America Securities. Ross, your line is open.","Ross Gilardi","Tony, you just touched on a little bit of that, a little of my question, but could you give a little more color on Construction & Forestry? I mean CAT put up negative 4% retail sales growth in North America construction yesterday for April and you're putting up in your guidance a 13% revenue growth in Construction foresee for 2017. So what's happening? I mean are you seeing a genuine acceleration in demand or is this just, a lot of this is just Deere dealer pipeline fill just because your dealer inventories were just so depleted going into this year?","Tony Huegel","Certainly I'd say it's a combination of things. As I mentioned with answering Rob's question, certainly last year as you recall, we ended our dealer inventories on a percent of sales basis, at the lowest level we'd had in over a decade. And even this year in our forecast on a percentage basis we're I think the second lowest in over a decade. So we're not building a lot of inventory but certainly we're not under-producing like we were. So that has given us a pretty significant lift.","We talked about in the first quarter, our order books are really quite strong and they continue to be strong through the second quarter. More importantly, over the last several months, we've seen retail sales actually up year-over-year as well. So that's certainly been encouraging and a big part of the reason why our forecast has now increased is we're starting to see those dealer orders pulling through into the retail channel.","So, from our perspective, industry retails were still flat to down slightly for U.S. construction equipment, but as you look at things like the smaller, what we call, commercial worksite or compact equipment, that continue to be very strong and we have new product there too that's helping to benefit the business. So there are a number of pieces. A big portion of that though is about our shipping to retail year-over-year versus under-producing last year.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Andrew, your line is open.","Andrew Casey","I guess I want to return to the underproduction\/overproduction comment versus retail, but if you look at the first six months, you saw mid-single-digit decline in U.S. equipment sales. Most of that seem to be related to Ag & Turf. And then if I combine last quarter's report with this quarter's, the first half receivables and inventory down about $670 million in Ag & Turf, is most of that $670 million inventory reduction or did you see kind of down receivables for the first six months?","Tony Huegel","Most of the reduction actually has been in trade receivables year-to-date.","Andrew Casey","Okay. And then can you update us, kind of follow-on on that, can you update us on the U.S. Canada high horsepower farm equipment order availability?","Tony Huegel","Yes, so if you look at, obviously combines are pretty straightforward and really no change from last year. I mean our early order program accounts for over 90% of that in any given year. So that's pretty full. As you look at, I'll talk to the Waterloo tractor numbers, last quarter I think we talked about it being relatively consistent. There were some puts and takes here and there. That order book actually has strengthened pretty significantly over the quarter. And I would say broadly speaking, our availability across the board on Waterloo product, that includes 7000, 8000 and 9000 series types of tractors, would be ahead or further out this year versus last year, and some of them fairly significantly. So again, over the course of the quarter, we've seen some real strength in the order book for those large tractors.","Operator","Our next question is from Joel Tiss from BMO Capital Markets. Joel, your line is open.","Joel Tiss","I just wondered if you could give us a sense, maybe the old baseball analogy on how far you threw the cost reduction efforts.","Rajesh Kalathur","Joel, we are making good progress with respect to the cost reduction, structural cost reduction, goal of $500-plus million that we talked about. Now you will recall that when we talked about it, we said if the industry conditions stay the same as in 2016 levels, we will aim to get over $500-plus million in structural cost reduction by the end of 2018 and before we realized in 2019.","And a couple of things I will point out. When we are making very good progress towards the structural portion, the controllable part of cost reduction, there are some headwinds, one essentially being the material inflation, then there is a second one that might confuse when you look at the total picture, which is lever pullings. As the volumes come up, we had pulled a lot of leverage over the last three years, and as the volumes come up, we'll be releasing some of those. But if you look at the underlying structural cost reduction, we are making very good progress and we are committed to hit the $500-plus million that we talked about.","Operator","Our next question is from Sebastian Kuenne from Berenberg Bank. Sebastian, your line is open.","Sebastian Kuenne","I have a question regarding Ag & Turf. You had roughly flat Q2. You're expecting very strong growth for the rest of the year. In what markets do you think you will outperform most compared to the competitors given that you are certainly cautious on the U.S. and Europe? So what are the key margins by how much you think you can outperform the sector?","Tony Huegel","We try to be a little cautious around getting too specific on market share just from a competitive reason. Obviously I think we talked a little bit on an earlier question about the fact that we do have anticipated market share gains in several of our key markets. We've had a beginning, a long history of market share gains in Brazil on both tractors and combines and we've continued to localize product there. I think that's expected to continue. You know it's not uncommon as we begin to see a bit of recovery and so on in markets even like North America with large ag that tends to be some of our best opportunities to see some market share, positive market share shifts, and certainly our investment in things like precision ag will benefit that and will help boost some of that.","We've done a lot of work on product and our dealer network in Europe as well and would hope to see at least some modest improvement as we move forward there. So I would say it's fairly broad where we would expect from some market share shift, but some markets may be a little more significant than others. And unfortunately, I can't get much more detailed than that but I appreciate the question.","Operator","Our next question is from Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Seth, your line is open.","Seth Weber","In the prepared remarks, I think I heard something about used equipment becoming more supportive of the environment in North America. Can you give us any additional color there whether that's in a reference to inventory levels or are you seeing pricing getting better, any additional help there would be great?","Tony Huegel","You're right, you heard that correctly. And I think it is a combination of things. I mean certainly used equipment levels do continue to come down and so that's been beneficial. In fact, we've kind of given a number versus the peak of summer of 2014. Last quarter we said it was down about 34%. It continued to come down in the second quarter this year, down about 36% from the peak. So that's certainly been supportive. And if you talk with many of our dealers, the volume of the overhang of used has become much less challenging for them.","Pricing I would still say very stable, continues to stabilize and in certain products, and I want to be very clear, specifically certain products, you might see some strengthening in pricing, but broadly it's supportive that the benefit to our dealer, the confidence that they have in the value, not just the volume but the value they have placed on that used inventory is much stronger today, and that just gives them a much better position to be able to consider both new and used sales and be able to work with customers that way.","Seth Weber","So you feel like that they are more open to taking new business because they have better visibility to the used market, is that what you're saying basically?","Tony Huegel","And I would say [indiscernible], we started saying that even as early as third quarter last year, the confidence that they have in some cases it's about their ability to take the equipment, but it's also significantly more confidence in the value they placed on it and their ability to get the appropriate level of margin when they turn that used piece of equipment. So, that's why the comment was written the way it was, it's not just about the ability to sell new but it's also about their ability to sell used at profitable levels, has become much more supportive.","Operator","Our next question is from Stanley Elliott from Stifel Nicolaus and Company. Stanley, your line is open.","Stanley Elliott","You all actually kind of answered the question, but is there a way to parse out how much of the increase on the construction side was from some of the new products you had at CONEXPO? You did talk about some of the smaller, the mini class, but also there's pretty much going on, on the production side class there as well. And then lastly, did you mention anything about the parts commitment having any impact on the sales outlook?","Tony Huegel","I would say, again the large portion of the sales increase for Construction & Forestry, again I would emphasize is really about the difference in our production to retail year-over-year. Certainly those new products are having some benefit. I mentioned the commercial worksite products. You're certainly seeing some benefit kind of more broadly with products as well to your point some of the production class equipment. I don't have a specific number that would identify how much specifically is coming from new product versus the change in retail. But certainly there's benefit there.","From a parts perspective, and I'm not sure I would necessarily attribute it immediately to the change in the warranty. That will take a bit of time to really see the full impact. But certainly as you think about our sales year-over-year parts is certainly stronger year-over-year as well. So that's helping to benefit that business.","Operator","Our next question is from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Jerry, your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Thank you for taking the follow up. Tony, can you talk about how you view normalized margins in Ag & Turf? Obviously really strong performance here towards the bottom of the cycle, and so if you apply your normal operating leverage, that would get you to 15-something percent type margins at normalized volumes, and I'm wondering at which point do you folks start to think about is that too high from a competitive standpoint, how do you think about what's normalized in this cycle for you?","Tony Huegel","I'll start and we'll see if Raj wants to throw any more in. But certainly, we've been pretty open and talked about, even introduced the 500 million reduction in structural cost. At that time, we talked about our mid-cycle margins as we would calculate them for the enterprise would be around 13%. And we've also been pretty open to your point about how much is too much, is wanting to make sure you kind of strike that balance between growth and margin.","Certainly our strategy calls for a 12% margin at mid cycle. We are committed to maintaining 12% or higher mid cycle margin. But as we continue to improve the current structure of the business, in some cases we believe what will drive larger shareholder value and the greater shareholder value isn't necessarily to see those structural improvements just dropping to higher and higher margins, but be able to leverage some of that towards some growth opportunities.","And so that's what we'll try to balance is opportunities to grow at at-least that 12% mid cycle margin with yet higher margins dropping to the bottom line. So a little bit of how we think about it. All right, let's go ahead and move on to the next caller, and I believe this will be our final question for the day.","Operator","Our last question is from Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray and Company. Brett, your line is open.","Brett Wong","Just wondering looking at Brazil, talking about your expectations for Moderfrota rates coming up here in June, were you surprised that you didn't see rates change during the [indiscernible] Show and do you think that impacted sales at all during that show and are there any, are the change expectations or change rate expectations factored into your guidance for the region in the year?","Tony Huegel","It's a great question. I'm not sure it was necessarily a surprise. I think as we spoke with our group there, actually Head of the Show, they were not anticipating it being announced at the show this year. I think it's worth noting some additional funding was announced at the show to kind of closeout and provide enough funding to cover through the current fiscal year, through the end of June. We would continue to anticipate the announcements potentially in the next couple of weeks, even with, as Josh mentioned in his opening comments, even with some of the uncertainty today that's in that market.","And there's a variety of questions candidly around what could happen going forward versus you have obviously could rate be lower and some would argue that the rates could come down a little bit given the fact that the broader market rates in Brazil have decreased. Others are actually advocating for rates to stay relatively the same but provide a higher level of funding, so you can fund more business. So we'll see where they land.","I think the important part of the conversation though is at least based on information or conversations we've had with government officials there, and I would say history and even very recent history, they continue to be very supportive of agriculture, specifically around the FINAME and the Moderfrota program. And so, some that are doing a bit of sabre-rattling about what could happen to that program, I think that would be a significant divergence from what they've shown in recent time.","So there's always risk, I'm not saying there's no risk here, but certainly we remain confident that the government will do everything they can to help support agriculture including supporting the FINAME program.","Okay, with that, I think we'll go ahead and conclude the call. We appreciate everyone's participation, and as always, we'll be around for the rest of the day for any follow-up questions. Thank you. Operator?","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"6918":["Deere (NYSE:DE) F2Q13 Results Earnings Call May 15, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Tony Huegel - Director of Investor Relations","Susan Karlix - Manager of Investor Communications","Raj Kalathur - Chief Financial Officer","Marie Ziegler - Deputy Financial Officer","","Analysts","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Ashish Gupta - CLSA","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","David Raso - ISI Group","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Mircea Dobre - Robert W.

","Susan Karlix","Thank you, Tony.  John Deere\u2019s second quarter was a good one.  Income and sales both reached new all-time quarterly highs.  It also was our 12th consecutive quarter over quarter record.","Ag and turf led the way last quarter, with higher sales and profit, and there was improvement in financial services as well.  John Deere is continuing to benefit from positive conditions in the global farm economy, which, as our CEO, Sam Allen, said, is showing impressive strength.","In conjunction with new products and further investments, this has led to more demand for our products and higher results.  It was, in summary, a record-breaking quarter, one that put Deere on track for another strong year.","Now let\u2019s take a look at the second quarter in detail, beginning on slide three.  Net sales and revenues were up 9% in the quarter to $10.9 billion.  Net income attributable to Deere and Company was $1.1 billion, including a charge related to taxes of approximately $56 million, a $0.14 impact to EPS.","As noted, these are the best-ever quarterly results recorded by the company.  On slide four, total worldwide equipment operations and net sales were $10.3 billion, up 9% quarter over quarter, including an unfavorable impact from currency translations of about 2 points.  Price realization in the quarter was positive by 3 points.  ","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let\u2019s start with agriculture and turf on slide five.  Sales were up 12% in the quarter on continuing strength in the global ag economy.  Operating profit was $1.6 billion, up 13%.  ","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let\u2019s look at some of the fundamentals affecting the ag business.  Slide six outlines U.S. farm cash receipts.  Driven by strong crop prices, 2012 forecast cash receipts were at a record $402 billion.  Cash receipts for 2013 are expected to remain historically strong and be the second highest on record.  ","For the year ahead, crop yields are forecasted to be higher than in 2012 and much closer to normal, but prices will be somewhat lower.  This reflects recovery from last year\u2019s drought conditions.  Livestock receipts are forecasted to be higher.","As a result of these factors, our forecast calls for 2013 cash receipts of about $388 billion.  As a reminder, in our modeling current and prior year cash receipts are the primary driver of equipment purchases in the U.S. market.  With cash receipts remaining at near record levels in 2013, this bodes well for future farm prospects.","Our economic outlook for the EU 27 is on slide seven.  We continue to see offsetting trends for the EU.  On the one hand, ag fundamentals remain positive and production is expected to increase slightly.  Still strong commodity prices are driving higher farm income.  These prices are leveling off at historic highs and pork and milk prices are favorable.","Conversely, farm machinery demand is expected to be lower in 2013 as the financial crisis continues to weigh on farmer sentiment and cold, wet weather in the U.K. threatens the 2013 harvest, following on the heels of the poor harvest of 2012.  ","On slide eight, you\u2019ll see the economic fundamentals outlined for a few of our other, targeted growth markets.  Slide nine illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness in Brazil.  With expectations for a strong soybean crop, due to an increase in acres planted, higher yields, and sustained high crop prices, the 2013 value of ag production in Brazil is expected to increase about 5% over the 2012 level.","The history of available financing rates on FINAME-eligible ag products is detailed on slide 10.  Current government programs in Brazil are supporting higher amounts of equipment sales.  Not only is the 2012-2013 subsidy amount allocated to agriculture higher, but available interest rates are also extremely low.  The FINAME financing rate is at 3% until June 30, then 3.5% through the end of December.  ","Our 2013 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on slide 11.  We have raised industry sales forecast in the U.S. and Canada every quarter this fiscal year, and are now projecting industry sales to be up about 5% in relation to the healthy level of 2012.  We continue to see strength in demand, especially for high horsepower tractors and combines.","The EU 27 industry outlook is down about 5%, no change from our prior forecast.  South America is another region for which we have consistently, each quarter, raised the industry outlook.  With strong commodity prices, forecasts call for an increase in planted acres and record crop production.","This combination of positive farm fundamentals, plus the supportive financing programs in Brazil discussed earlier, has led us to increase our forecast for the region once again.  We now expect industry sales of tractors and combines in South America to be up 15-20% in 2013.","Our 2013 industry outlook in the CIS countries remains at down slightly due to import duties that are reducing demand for Western manufactured combines.  In Asia, we are tweaking our outlook downward to be little changed from 2012.","Turning to another product category, we now expect industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be flat to down slightly in 2013, reflecting the cool, wet spring in North America and cautious consumer sentiment.  This, too, is a slight reduction from last quarter.  Historically, riding lawn equipment sales that are lost in the important selling months of March and April aren\u2019t recovered as the season goes on.  ","Putting this all together on slide 12, fiscal year 2013 Deere sales of worldwide ag and turf equipment are now forecast to be up about 7%, including about 1 point of negative currency translation.  At constant currency, the sales forecast is up about 8%, 2 points higher than our February outlook.","2013 operating margin for the ag and turf division is forecast at about 15%.  It is important to remember when modeling ag for the remainder of the year that production was back-end loaded in 2012.  This results in some very tough comparisons as we head into the second half of 2013, especially for combines.","Sales comparisons in the back half of the year are not reflective of a slowing market, but of tough comparisons to sales levels a year ago.  In 2013, U.S. and Canada combine shipments are returning to a more normal pattern, about 40% in the first half, 60% in the second.  ","This compares to a 25\/75 split in 2012. So, while full year 2013 combine shipments are up year over year, shipments will be lower in the second half compared with the strong levels we saw last year.  ","Let\u2019s focus now on construction and forestry on slide 13.  Net sales were down 6% in the quarter and operating profit was down 42%.  The division\u2019s results were affected by lower shipment volumes and higher production costs, including those associated with interim tier four.  ","Increased SA&G expenses in support of global growth also hurt the quarterly\u2019s results.  Looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, you\u2019ll note that global insight has slightly improved its outlook for GDP and nonresidential spending since last quarter.  Other indicators, however, are flat to down.  ","Overall economic growth continues at a sluggish pace, awaiting resolution of the fiscal, economic, and trade issues that are undermining business confidence and restraining growth.  And, cool, wet weather conditions in the United States and Canada have delayed spring construction projects, which have further slowed demand for equipment.  We are also experiencing lower sales to independent rental companies compared with the pre-interim tier four transition purchasing experienced in 2012.  ","Global forestry markets are expected to be about flat in 2013, as weakness in Europe is being offset by improvement in the United States.  Fiscal 2013 net sales in construction forestry are now forecast to be down about 5%.  Our previous outlook was up about 3%.  ","The sales decline is reflected in lower inventory and receivable numbers, which we will discuss shortly, and it has had an impact on mix as we reduce shipments of high margin equipment.  C&F full year operating margin is now projected to be about 5%.","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operation.  Slide 15 shows the financial services provision for credit losses as a percentage of the total average owned portfolio at the end of the quarter was 2 basis points.  This reflects the excellent quality of our portfolios and recoveries from prior years writeoff.  ","Our 2013 financial forecast now contemplates a loss provision of about 7 basis points as a percentage of the average owned portfolio.  That is a reduction of 9 basis points from what was being forecast last quarter.  The 10-year average is about 27 basis points.  ","Moving to slide 16, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $125 million in the second quarter, versus $109 million last year.  For the full year, net income attributable to Deere and Company is now forecast to be about $550 million.","Slide 17 outlines receivables and inventory.  For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter up about $420 million, or equal to approximately 33% of prior 12-month sales compared with almost 36% a year ago.  The year over year forecasted increase is in ag and is mainly reflective of higher sales volumes.","C&F is expected to be down about $150 million, driven by slowing demand and a reduction in Canadian consigned inventories.  We expect to end 2013 with receivables and inventory up about $175 million.  That is a decrease of $325 million from our February forecast.","Our guidance for cost of sales as a percentage of net sales, shown on slide 18, remains at approximately 74% for the full year.  Cost of sales ran about 73.3% in the first half, which implies the second half of the year will be about 75%.  Factors affecting cost of sales include price realization, production or manufacturing costs, raw material costs, engine emission product costs, absorption, and effects of foreign exchange.","When modeling the full year, keep in mind price realization.  We are forecasting about 3 points in 2013.  Favorable year over year raw material costs, the impact on cost of sales of new employees. In keeping with our growth plans, Deere hired an additional 5,000 people in 2012, with over 3,000 of them joining us in the last three-quarters of the year.  ","These additions are critical to support our growth, both domestically and internationally, and will impact cost of sales, R&D, and SA&G in 2013, interim tier 4 product cost absorption due to the lower build in inventory compared to 2012 and an unfavorable mix in product in C&F, as we talked about earlier, as well as some strengthening in small ag compared to 2012.   ","Looking at R&D expense on slide 19, R&D was up about 7% in the second quarter, compared with the same period last year.  This is consistent with our earlier guidance that the increase R&D spending for 2013 would occur in the first half of the year.  Our 2013 forecast continues to call for R&D expense to be up about 3% for the full year.","Moving now to slide 20, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up about 9% in the second quarter.  Very much like R&D, the quarter over quarter increases for SA&G were heavily weighted to the first half of the year.","SA&G expense is forecasted to be up about 7% in 2013, no change from our previous guidance.  On slide 21, pension and OPEB expense was up about $60 million in the quarter, compared with last year.  Second quarter 2012 benefited from lower post-retirement healthcare costs.","Turning to slide 22, the equipment operations tax rate was about 38% in the second quarter, with the rate affected by discrete items, the most significant explained on the slide.  The charge of about $56 million impacted EPS by approximately $0.14, and the tax rate by about 3%.  For full year 2013, the effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%, representing no change from our previous forecast.","On slide 23, you see our equipment operations history of strong cash flow.  We continue to forecast cash flow from equipment operations to be about $3.4 billion in 2013.  ","On slide 24, we outline our 2013 outlook for the third quarter and full year.  Our net sales forecast for the third quarter is up about 3% compared with 2012.  This includes about 2 points of price realization.  The full year forecast now calls for net sales to be up about 5%, with about 1 point of unfavorable exchange.  At constant currency, up about 6%, which represents no change from our last forecast.  Price realization is expected to be positive by about 3 points.  Finally, our full year 2013 net income forecast remains unchanged at about $3.3 billion.  ","In closing, 2013 is shaping up as another good year.  The ag economy in particular remains in sound shape, and Deere is very well-positioned to benefit from that fact.  It is true the near term outlook remains guarded due to uncertainties over global financial issues as well as the cold spring weather in North America.  But the longer term picture remains extremely bright, and the source of much confidence about the future.","Indeed, Deere\u2019s plans for helping make the world\u2019s growing need for food, shelter, and infrastructure are well on track and moving ahead.  In our view, trends of this nature have power and persistence, and we firmly believe they hold great promise for our customers and investors in the years ahead.  Tony?  ","Tony Huegel","Thank you, Susan.  Now we\u2019re ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call.  The operator will instruct you on the call procedure, but as a reminder, in consideration of others, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow up.  If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue.  Operator?  ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  Our first question comes from Jamie Cook.  ","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Just some additional color on the lower guide within construction and forestry.  Again, I feel like it\u2019s the same question as last quarter.  If I look at your U.S. economic indicators, they really haven\u2019t changed that much, and in some instances have gone up, yet you\u2019re lowering your forecast.  So can you talk about sort of what\u2019s Deere-specific versus the market?  Are you losing market share?  And how much of it was weather-related?  And just the second question, can you just give a little more color on the mix issues that you cited that are impacting the margins?","Tony Huegel","Really, what\u2019s driving most of it, as you look at the industry overall, as Susan talked about in the opening comments, we\u2019re really just seeing a lag.  To your point, the underlying fundamentals continue to be relatively strong, but as you look at some of the general economy, you look at GDP last quarter for example, was slower than expected.  Some of the overhang that we\u2019re experiencing from the fiscal policies is weighing, again, on construction.  And to your point, whether being cold and wet has delayed some construction projects in the spring, and we think that\u2019s also had some impact.  But it\u2019s really not a market share story, per se.  ","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","I guess you\u2019re just not hearing about this as much from some of your peers, so that\u2019s what\u2019s more surprising.  And I know I\u2019m only allowed one question, but you had some dealer inventory issues in the latest quarter, which were small.  Are they largely resolved now?","Tony Huegel","I think as you look at dealer inventory, and we\u2019ve talked about guiding lower, our guidance for the end of the year is lower for receivables and inventory and down year over year, which again is reflective of sales.  ","So I would tell you that both last quarter and this quarter most of that inventory reduction is really just reflective of the change and being in line with the change in the overall sales that we\u2019re forecasting, not so much that we have excess inventory that we\u2019re trying to take out, but as the sales forecast comes down so does the necessary inventory.  ","And I\u2019d also point out, as the demand reduces, you also have some shorter lead times.  So dealers don\u2019t need to carry as much inventory, which is part of the reduction that they\u2019re seeing in terms of what they need to have on their lots in terms of meeting the existing demand.  ","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","And then sorry, the last one on the margins, on C&F.  Now we\u2019re guiding to 5%.  How much of that is mix, or of the 3% pricing, what are you getting in C&F, if any?  If you could just give color on that.","Tony Huegel","In terms of pricing, and we\u2019re talking about the 3% on the enterprise, all I can say is that construction and forestry is certainly contributing to that.  But as you know we don\u2019t give guidance on individual divisions.  But certainly they are contributing.  As you look at mix, that\u2019s certainly a part of it, but keep in mind, now with our current outlook, we\u2019re well below mid-cycle in our forecast for construction, and that certainly weighs on margin.  And as Susan mentioned, the reduction that we\u2019ve experienced in our outlook is on some of the higher margin product as well.  So that\u2019s certainly weighing on margins as well.  ","Raj Kalathur","Your comment about you\u2019re not hearing this from others, with regard to construction and forestry, now, do compare the commensurate quarter, most recent quarter, for comparable competitors.  In terms of our operating return on sales, we are either comparable or better than most.  This came up last quarter as well, and I think we were actually in the same position.  Our operating return on sales is comparable or better than most of the competitors in the industry, and if you look at the North America, we\u2019re not different from the competitors on the sales as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz.  ","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays","Can you talk about your ag and turf inventory?  You actually lowered your forecast for the end of the year despite raising your overall sales guide.  Should we read into your inventory change that it\u2019s reflective of your confidence level going into 2014?  Because last year you obviously had a big inventory build going into the end of the year.  Or is this just a tweak?","Tony Huegel","I would argue it\u2019s just a tweak.  As you look at the change for the ag and turf division, it was like $100 million change, which is very minimal.  Most of that is really related to final tier 4.  Again, as we solidify plans around that transition, you\u2019re going to see some tweaking there, and that\u2019s how I would describe it.  Nothing more.  ","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays","And it\u2019s fair to say, though, that in the second half of the year that\u2019s when you really decide what the \u201914 outlook looks like, and you could change inventory again based on that, correct?","Tony Huegel ","Certainly, yeah.  As we move into this next quarter, we\u2019ll start to have a better feel of what 2014 is looking like as we begin some of our early order programs.  We\u2019ll start to see our tractor order books in some cases will begin to extend into the next year, and so we\u2019ll have some visibility at that point.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays ","So let me ask you about ag incrementals.  I know everybody\u2019s going to ask you about this, but you were pretty clear about saying that mix is going to work against you in the second half.  We know that you\u2019ve said that before.  But at the same time, you did have an execution issue in Q3 of last year and you have said, over and over again, that SG&A and R&D would be front-end loaded.  So why can\u2019t margins be up pretty significantly year over year in Q3, both incremental and year over year?  What\u2019s stopping that from happening?","Tony Huegel ","Certainly from an incremental perspective, keep in mind that the biggest change incrementally will be on absorption, as you look at production in the first half versus the second half.  Last year, and even year over year, you had a heavier build schedule in the back half of the year versus what we did this year.  So that\u2019s a big part of the difference.","Raj Kalathur","And in terms of ag and turf incrementals, you\u2019ll also notice, if you think about Q2, there was an increase in the pension and OPEB expense, FX, and R&D.  So that contributed.  If you add those back, our incrementals would look like you would expect.  Now, some of that is also going to carry into the second half.","Operator","Our next question comes from Annual Duignan.  ","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan ","Can we talk about your cash position?  You get on the call, you say how wonderful things are, how great the cycle is, and how the fundamentals are wonderful in agriculture, and yet we continue to sit on excess cash.  Why are we not being more aggressive buying back shares at this point?  Is it the fear that the ag cycle is well above mid-cycle and that things could deteriorate from here?  What\u2019s the root cause of the hesitancy at this point?","Marie Ziegler","Absolutely not, in terms of where we are in the ag cycle.  I would admit that our balance sheet is a bit defensive right now.  We continue to be concerned about the functioning of the market overall.  Bear in mind that our capital corporation, which is over $30 billion in receivables, or in assets that must be funded, is a big user of cash.  And the rating agencies are very, very riveted on liquidity.  So we are ensuring that we remain very liquid in order to support the financial services business.","Raj Kalathur ","Our cash use priorities have not changed.  So again, with respect to dividends and share repurchases, if you take a long term view, you should not see a change on how we act on it.  But what Marie explained, short term, we have some costs, costs in the environment that we are living in, and we are taking appropriate precautions.   ","Marie Ziegler","And I do note that we did increase our dividend $0.05 a share, which is about an 11% increase per quarter.  So we are increasing our return.  ","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan ","That\u2019s a fair point.  My follow up question is more on the fundamentals.  You know, we\u2019re sitting here kind of at the crossroads of the \u201913 to \u201914 crop.  We either get the corn planted and we get lower prices potentially.  Farmers have not hedged as much this year, at least those that I\u2019ve spoken to, which could leave them in a risky position.  Or we don\u2019t get the corn planted, and we switch into beans and we\u2019re short a crop again.  Can you guys talk a little bit about each of those scenarios and what you think each one might do to the fundamentals in terms of equipment demand?  I\u2019m just curious how you take those outcomes and put them into a forecast.","Tony Huegel ","At this point, that\u2019s really a challenge in terms of what might happen.  Certainly most of the planting in the corn belt, on corn, already would have taken place in a more normal year, by May 5 or so.  But certainly if you get good weather, to your point, that can change in terms of what gets planted in a hurry.  ","We look at our forecast and just as you know it\u2019s about cash receipts being the primary driver.  So as you look at what may happen, but not just what production level, or what the price level is, or how much corn or soybeans is produced, it\u2019s going to drive that demand.  Certainly for 2013 we\u2019re continuing to see a very strong cash receipts level.  I think it\u2019s the second highest on record.  So slightly below the 2012 cash receipts, but at very very high levels.  ","And so that data point would certainly bode well for the future, but also, as you know, as we look at next year, it will be impacted both by the 2013 and 2014 cash receipts.  But at this point, it would be highly speculative to try to estimate what 2014 would be.  ","Marie Ziegler","If you look at the global fundamentals you continue to see rising demand for food and some increase in consumption of meat.  You see, in the U.S., very strong farmer balance sheets.  Despite what\u2019s been happening with land prices, you haven\u2019t seen a big ramp up in debt loads for farmers.  And in fact, the debt-to-cap ratio has actually declined this year.  So we\u2019re in a very strong position.  And we continue to feel very positive about the outlook and prospects for the global business. ","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan ","Marie, the cynic in me wants to say, and that would bring me back to my first question.  So I\u2019ll leave it there and get back in line and take it offline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashish Gupta.  ","Ashish Gupta - CLSA","Can you give us some more color on the order book?","Tony Huegel ","Sure, the order book does remain pretty strong.  We talked about combines last time.  There\u2019s really no change there in terms of as it relates to the early order program, effectively for the U.S. for all practical purposes sold out.  Large tractors continue to progress very well.  You look at 8R tractors, for example, availability is further out than a year ago, even on some higher capacity.  ","So as you look at the track tractor, you\u2019re looking at late September availability.  And for the wheeled tractor, you\u2019re into October for availability.  And on the 9000, you\u2019re looking at October for the track large tractor, and then August for the wheeled tractor.  So again, it remains very, very strong in terms of the order book.   ","Ashish Gupta - CLSA","One clarification on the tax item.  Is it correct to assume that the unchanged tax rate would be inclusive of the item for the full year?","Tony Huegel ","Absolutely.  In fact, the question we had last quarter even with the lower tax rate in the first quarter, you\u2019ll note that we kept our annual forecast the same.  And it\u2019s reflective of what you saw in the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer.  ","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","Two quick questions.  I guess you kind of answered it with the comments on the order board.  Does that mean, then, that your cautious comments on the weather and the planting are really applicable to the last quarter of the year?  Because Q3 is kind of dialed in.  And then as a corollary to that, there\u2019s been some changes in production capacity you mentioned.  Can you talk a little bit about production capacity?  Typically Q3 has been lower than Q2, and I think that\u2019s on shutdowns in June.  Has that changed at all in terms of what you can produce Q3 versus Q2?","Tony Huegel ","Certainly as you look year over year.  Combines is the largest difference when you compare year over year.  We were very back end loaded on combines last year.  The first half, second half of shipments was 25% in the first half versus 75% in the back half.  A more normal year would be 35-65, and this year we would actually be a little bit more front-end from normal, so about 40-60.  ","Again, when you\u2019re looking year over year, you\u2019re seeing the back half definitely impacted by that in terms of orders.  But again, as you look at the overall year, very strong orders in that regard.  It\u2019s more about the timing of our production, much of it driven by interim tier 4.  Now as we look forward to final tier 4 you have some disruptions here and there.   ","Marie Ziegler ","As you look ahead, you\u2019ll see, because of the compressed production transition times that we will have with final tier 4, you\u2019re going to see some noise in early next year and late this year as we adjust.  ","Maybe I could go back to the first part of your question.  Given the thought that corn plantings and bean plantings are very significantly delayed from typical averages, we felt it was prudent to put that note of caution in the press release.  Certainly they have plenty of time to make it up, and they can if we get some breaks in the weather, which we\u2019ve had in the last couple of days.  We have not seen any cancellations at this stage, and you are absolutely correct that very strong order books do portend well.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","So the caution, therefore, in the press release, is more Deere caution that what you\u2019re hearing from farmers and dealers in terms of getting nervous in?","Marie Ziegler ","Correct.  Everyone says that given the opportunity to plant, there\u2019s still plenty of time to plant before you hit significant yield erosion.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Raso.","David Raso - ISI Group ","The second half of the year growth for ag and turf, can you just help us with blatantly just clarifying the order book or the backlog?  What is the backlog for ag right now year over year?","Marie Ziegler ","It would be better.","Tony Huegel ","Yeah, as you look at the tracker, certainly the order book on 8s and 9s are further out.  So you have a stronger order book.  But again, some of that is timing of production year over year and that\u2019s really what you\u2019re seeing.  And again, overall, on ag, as you go into the back half of the year, we\u2019re lower first half than second half, and that\u2019s why you start to see some of the drag on margins and higher cost of sales as you go into back half of the year.","Marie Ziegler ","Year over year, our guidance does imply a modest increase in our sales in the second half.","David Raso - ISI Group ","That\u2019s what I\u2019m just trying to square up.  Obviously revenues for you globally are notably bigger on big tractors and combines.  A global comment.  Your order book for large tractors is longer than a year ago, and you\u2019re doing it on higher capacity capabilities at the factory.  So tractors, if you get rid of combines, the tractor looks like it should be up a lot more than the 1% total ag and turf revenue for the rest of the year.  So combines are obviously down a lot to get the whole division to only up 1.  ","Tony Huegel ","Keep in mind that as you look at total annual production versus the timing, you\u2019ve got final tier 4 coming in, so you\u2019re going to have some disruption there within the factories doing limited production builds, those sorts of things, that do have an impact on individual quarters of availability.  As you look also, our inventory build year over year is not as large as it was last year.  So that\u2019s also going to have some impact as you look into the back half of the year.  So again, those are really what\u2019s primarily driving that difference, is timing of production as you look sequentially from the first half to the second half.","Raj Kalathur ","You know, what Tony talked about in terms of harvesters, 25-75 last year first half, second half versus 40-60 from harvester [works].  Waterloo, if you take some of the key tractors in Waterloo, that\u2019s also 45-55 last year, to about 50-50.  So there is some shift in tractors as well.  It\u2019s not just a combine phenomenon.","David Raso - ISI Group ","So let\u2019s take the revenue guidance, then, as well-explained.  That\u2019s why it\u2019s up only 1.  Why, then, in the second half of the year, with a bit of an adverse mix of combines down that much, would the incremental margins be better in the second half than the first?  Because that is what\u2019s being implied.  You\u2019re implying 25-30% incrementals for ag and turf in the second half, and they were only 22% in the first half.  ","Marie Ziegler ","Our guidance for cost of sales would suggest that our cost of sales would be lower in the second half of 2013 than it was in the second half of 2012.","David Raso - ISI Group ","I\u2019m asking why though.","Marie Ziegler ","You don\u2019t have the disruption, if you will, of last year in terms of the combine costs.  The incremental raw materials are going the right direction this year.  And while we have some significant costs ahead on final tier 4, you are anniversarying some costs on interim tier 4.","David Raso - ISI Group ","That\u2019s helpful.  So the price cost may be a bit helpful at a minimum, in general, if costs are part of the story.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich.  ","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Tony, can you just talk about the learning curve that you\u2019ve seen at your facilities over the course of interim tier 4 implementations?  And just talk about how that has impacted any change in the plan for tier 4 final.  Do you think you can do it maybe more efficiently than you were thinking about it two to three quarters ago?  Can you just help us understand that dynamic?","Tony Huegel ","To your point, as we went through interim tier 4 there was a significant number of transitions in a more narrow window than we normally would have.  But keep in mind that as you think of final tier 4, there\u2019s learning to be had there.  As you look at final tier 4, however, that window\u2019s going to be even more narrow.  And in some cases, we had some product that skipped interim tier 4 and will go directly to final tier 4.  So you have a larger number of models that need to transition.  And again, relative to interim tier 4, a more narrow window.  So it is not without risk or challenge, and certainly that comes with additional cost too, as we try to manage that short window.","Marie Ziegler ","I would further add, the learnings that we have from [IT4] very much help position us to accomplish, but will be this large number of introductions in this compressed timeframe ahead.","Tony Huegel ","Right.  For example, as you look at the number of engines, the different tiers of engines, you think of tractors that are built in Waterloo, for example, when we went to interim tier 4 you added another model of engine that you had to had, because you\u2019re still building tier 3 for certain markets, tier 2 for certain markets, and now you\u2019ve added interim tier 4.  As you go to final tier 4, while it\u2019s a different technology, in most cases you\u2019re not still building interim tier 4.  So the number of different engines that you\u2019re introducing doesn\u2019t change while you\u2019re transitioning over.  So you get some of those learnings and some of those benefits.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs ","And can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in your European business?  I know you\u2019ve had a pretty big new implement cycle recently.  Your retail sales have been pretty good in April.  Can you just talk about from a Deere standpoint what does your outlook for Europe look like this year in contrast to the industry outlook that you provided?  And then perhaps give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about potential to localize combine assembly and what it would take to get localization standards in Russia to help the VAT issue there.  ","Tony Huegel ","Sure.  And as you know, as it relates to Europe, we don\u2019t provide guidance by geography there, but certainly as you pointed out, not only with the new products, but also working on our dealer distribution and strengthening that further, and as it relates to market share, those are going well.  ","But it\u2019s a difficult market, to be honest, in the sense of, as Susan pointed out in the introduction, while you have great underlying fundamentals, you have the overarching concerns with the fiscal issues there that are putting pressure on sales.  And so our forecast for the industry is certainly down year over year.  So again, it\u2019s a tough market from that perspective.  ","But certainly in northern Europe, with the exception of the U.K., still seeing those markets hang in pretty well, especially as you look at Germany and France.  Those markets remain pretty strong.  The U.K., because of weather issues, is not doing quite as well.  ","As it relates to Russia, I assume is what you meant with localizing combine, it\u2019s really too early.  We\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens with that tariff in June or July, whether that gets extended or not and reevaluated at that point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mircea Dobre.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird ","My first question is, I\u2019m trying to get a better sense for performance in the second quarter.  When I look at your guidance for the second quarter, you call for 4% revenue growth yet you did about 9% in the quarter.  And I\u2019m wondering, given that you generally have pretty good visibility three months out, especially in ag, where you do a lot of preselling, why was there such a surprise to the upside?","Marie Ziegler ","Good levels of activity in ag, in large ag especially.  Large ag has continued to be very strong, and that\u2019s reflected in our guidance.  I don\u2019t have anything more exciting than that.  "," ","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird ","Nonetheless, it does bring some question with regard to your visibility here.  Because there\u2019s quite a bit of departure from your initial guidance.","Marie Ziegler ","Well, I\u2019d like to say that we are the world\u2019s experts at forecasting.  I think if you\u2019ve followed us, as you continue to follow us, there is some variability quarter to quarter in terms of how shipments go, what\u2019s on the water, what\u2019s not, and how currency moves.  And so we are not as precise as I guess we would like to be.  So I think we would view this as more a normal noise.","Tony Huegel ","And to Marie\u2019s point, as you think about the export markets and so on, in terms of when we recognize sales, that certainly can shift.  And as we see more sales outside the U.S. and exports to those markets, it does create some variability.  So a lot of times, it can be as simple as timing of when those products arrive in port.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird ","My follow up here is I\u2019m trying to understand your farm cash receipts forecast.  So you\u2019re talking about the late planting season and the risk that that adds to crop.  And looking this quarter versus the prior quarter, your yield estimates are a little bit lower.  Planted acres are a little bit lower.  So the size of the crop is a little bit lower.  Yet your farm commodity price projections are also a little bit lower.  You\u2019d think that if we have a smaller crop, all else being held constant, we\u2019d have at least stable, if not higher overall prices.  So how are you thinking about that?","Tony Huegel ","Well, you\u2019re looking at just a few of the pieces that go into that forecast.  There are a number of pieces.  One in  particular I would note is carryover stocks, and there was an adjustment by the USDA during the quarter of the carryover stock levels coming out of 2012.  So there are a large number of variables that go into that forecast.  But keep in mind much of that is still based on assumptions of, generally speaking, [trend yields].  So to your point, it was brought down a little bit based on the late planting, but by and large, we\u2019re still assuming trend or close to trend yields and normal weather.","Marie Ziegler ","The other thing that you might want to think about as you look at those estimates is also impacted by the South American crop development, what\u2019s happening down there.  Harvest has gone pretty well, good yields there.  And by patterns in terms of seed and residual use, even in the U.S.  And you\u2019ve seen some adjustments there due to high corn prices.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Casey.  ","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","","Understanding that the 2013 U.S. large farm equipment demand continues to be very strong, I\u2019m wondering how anticipatory the company may be in reaction to the forecast that was just discussed, the 8% decline expected.  ","Marie Ziegler ","Sorry, what 8% decline?","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities ","The 8% U.S. crop cash flow that\u2019s included, basically on page 34.  Year over year.","Marie Ziegler ","The second highest ever.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities ","I understand, Marie.  So as you just indicated, it\u2019s still strong, but historically, inflections have kind of suggested some future directional changes for the large equipment demand.  So if your forecast proves accurate and the historical relationship holds, could you help us understand what actions we should look for if your medium-term cycle outlook starts to deteriorate sometime during the back half of the year?","Tony Huegel"," ","One of the things we\u2019ve talked about, and we\u2019ve said this both when the forecast was slightly up and when it was slightly down, and so really what we have said is you\u2019re looking at the very high levels of cash receipts.  It\u2019s not a one-for-one relationship of up and down, driving sales up and down.  Really what we would consider is this is more flattish at very, very high, very supportive levels.  And you\u2019re going to see some minor inflections literally going both ways.  And again, we said this first quarter, when the forecast was actually slightly up.  We were saying the same thing.  The important point is that these are at very high, very supportive levels for continued strength in large ag sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Weber.  ","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","On the construction and forestry margin, can you help us understand, I know you\u2019ve had some startup costs there over the last couple of quarters.  How big of a headwind is that, and how much longer do you think that will continue, and just maybe give us a status update on that capacity increase.","Tony Huegel","Certainly, we have new facilities, we talked about China, Brazil, where really at this point we\u2019re not seeing - in Brazil\u2019s case, we\u2019re not seeing any sales from that particular facility that are being generated while we have the higher costs, both in terms of people on the ground, building out dealer networks, those sorts of things.  And you\u2019d have the same thing in China.  ","Really, you\u2019re not going to see any significant sales from those markets until well into 2014, and they\u2019ll begin to produce 2014, but they won\u2019t be fully ramped up probably until 2015 for all practical purposes.  ","You may be aware that in Brazil we are importing product to that market, as we do have some dealers in place.  But keep in mind, both with the tariffs that have come in as well as the FINAME rates that we talked about being very supportive for ag, are not so supportive for imported construction products, as you compete in the market with some local manufacturers.  So that then is a challenge from a margin perspective.  ","But long term, we still believe that\u2019s the right direction as we build out that dealer network so that they\u2019re prepared and in place when those factories do begin to produce.  So there\u2019s certainly some challenges there, but don\u2019t underestimate, also, the fact that as we bring our sales forecast down, it\u2019s challenging both from the perspective of we\u2019re lower as a percentage of midpoint in those factories.  That certainly hurts margin.  And that reduction in a lot of cases was on very high margin construction equipment, which also pulled margins down.  So that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving that margin decrease.  ","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","So you don\u2019t think the startup costs actually become a bigger headwind the next couple quarters before the production really hits?","Tony Huegel ","I wouldn\u2019t say that.  Certainly, as you get closer, you\u2019re adding more people, and those costs do increase.  But all I\u2019m saying is don\u2019t underestimate just the impact, also, of lower sales on higher margin business.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets ","Is it possible to give an idea how much currency affected the ag margin in the quarter?","Tony Huegel ","Yeah, it was about $40 million in the quarter.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets ","On operating income?","Tony Huegel ","Yes, absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry DeMaria.","Larry DeMaria - William Blair ","I\u2019m curious as to your thoughts on China becoming a more material net importer of corn.  The USDA has China importing some this year, and there [grumble] that we may be near a tipping point, which would obviously be able to scoop up some of the large surplus that we may have this year.  So do you guys see that as a big benefit for the U.S. farmer over time?  Or not material?","Marie Ziegler ","I think we\u2019re very cautious on what the potential there is.  Depending on whose viewpoint you\u2019re looking at, it could be very significant for the U.S. farmer, but there\u2019s certainly some who are quite cautious about what that opportunity at the end of the day really will be.","Tony Huegel ","The other thing that I would note is right now USDA is projecting about 7 million tons, up from about 3 million from the 2012-2013.  So that\u2019s certainly a sizable increase.  The other thing that I would note is the new leadership.  Previously there was a very strong pursuit of self-sufficiency.  That has tended to moderate some.  So to your point, I think some have been maybe a little more optimistic about what that could mean for imports, but to Marie\u2019s point, it\u2019s very very difficult to forecast Chinese foreign imports.","Larry DeMaria - William Blair ","Okay, so no material sea change from what you see today.  And then just second question, you guys called out the subsidies in Brazil and the fundamentals in Brazil.  Can you just help us understand how you guys think about which is more important going forward?  And if subsidies reverse and the interest rates go up going into next year, would that imply a relatively significant drop off if the fundamentals stay pretty strong?  Or could we grow through this?  How are you thinking about subsidies versus fundamentals in Brazil over time?","Tony Huegel ","You know, it\u2019s hard to split the two and know which is really driving more.   What we would say is clearly they\u2019re both beneficial.  We are hopeful that when they announce the upcoming year\u2019s budget in either late May, early June, that they\u2019ll make an announcement of what the interest rate will be going into 2014.  The government has made statements publicly about being very supportive of agriculture, so there\u2019s some optimism that those rates will stay low.  Whether they\u2019ll stay as low as they are this year is hard to guess.  But at this point, it\u2019s hard to guess what may happen there.","Larry DeMaria - William Blair ","Do you think we might know in the next couple months?","Tony Huegel ","Certainly we\u2019re hopeful that we would know what the rate will be as we go in, but there\u2019s not any real history that they always announce it.  But there\u2019s some speculation that they will.","Operator","Our final question comes from Ross Gilardi.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America"," ","Just on that last question, you guys obviously talked a lot about the headwinds in the fourth quarter in ag, but could you see a surge in year-end buying in Brazil in advance of the rates going up in December?","Tony Huegel ","Again, it depends on what those rates are doing.  And keep in mind, our calendar year end is the beginning of our fiscal year.  So that would, even if that were to happen in that November - December timeframe, that really does benefit our 2014.  The other thing I would point out is keep in mind it\u2019s a little bit different than what you tend to think of in U.S. policies in that the sales needs to be in place and the approval for the financing by the end of the year.  But you have, in most cases, a couple of months to actually take delivery of the equipment.  So even with a December 31 cutoff, that can benefit a couple of months calendar into 2014, and really well into our fiscal 2014.   ","Thank you very much, and with that we\u2019re going to have to cut off.  We thank you for your participation in the call.  And as always, we will be available the rest of the day to answer any additional questions you may have.

Also on the call today are Ryan Campbell, our Chief Financial Officer; Cory Reed, President of Ag and Turf Division and Brent Norwood, Manager of Investor Communications. Today, we will take a closer look at Deere's second quarter earnings, then spend some time talking about our markets and our current outlook for fiscal 2019. After that, we will respond to your questions. Please note that slides are available to complement the call. They can be accessed on our website at www.johndeere.com\/earnings.","First, a reminder.

Brent?","Brent Norwood","John Deere completed the second quarter with solid results despite uncertain conditions in the agricultural sector. While near term ag markets remain challenging in the U.S., foreign markets such as Brazil showed signs of strength. Additionally, the ag division continues to make solid progress, advancing our technology investments and innovative new product programs.","In construction and forestry, end market demand remained strong, resulting from broad based industry drivers such a GDP growth, oil and gas activity and infrastructure investments. With order books extending into the fourth quarter, the division is on track for a solid finish to the year.","Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at our second quarter results beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were up 6% to $11.3 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $1.135 billion or $3.52 per diluted share.","On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 5% to $10.273 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 4 points, while currency translation was negative by 4 points. ","At this point, I\u2019d like to welcome to the call Cory Reed, President of Ag and Turf with responsibility for sales and marketing in the Americas, as well as a number of platforms, including precision ag and crop harvesting. Over his 20 plus year career at Deere, Cory has held many roles within the Ag and Turf division and the most recently served as President of John Deere Financial.","Cory Reed","Thanks Brent. I\u2019ll start with a review of our agriculture and turf business on Slide 5. Net sales were up 3% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, primarily driven by higher shipment volumes and price realization, partially offset by negative impact of currency translation.","Operating profit was $1.019 billion, resulting in a 14% operating margin for the division. During the quarter price realization offset material and freight inflation, while other production costs ran slightly higher than expected. With regards to material cost inflation, keep in mind that our steel contracts operate on a three to six month lag to spot prices. Lastly, changes in currency had an unfavorable impact to the margins of 1.5%.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let\u2019s look at the fundamentals affecting the ag business, on Slide 6. Despite high production levels forecasted for the \u201919 and \u201920 season, corn's global stock to use ratio is expected to decline in response to record consumption outpacing supply. Conversely, wheat stock to use ratio is projected to increase in \u201919 and \u201920 due to a sharp production recovery from last year\u2019s drought stricken regions, such as Europe and Australia.","Meanwhile, Soybean stock to use ratio was forecasted to remain at elevated levels through \u201919 and \u201920 marketing year in response to higher than expected yields in U.S. and the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China. The inventory increase is further compounded by uncertainty for near term global demand as the African swine fever has significantly diminished the herd size in China.","Slide 7 outlines U.S. principal crop cash receipts, an important indicator for equipment demand. 2019 principal crop cash receipts are estimated to be roughly $117 billion, a decline of 4% since last quarter, reflecting the recent pressure on commodity prices resulting from rising stocks, diminished market access and near term demand uncertainty. The confluence of these factors compounded further by U.S. late planting seasons have adversely affected farmer sentiment in recent weeks.","As a result, further trade progress between the U.S. and China is becoming increasingly important to the near term sentiment. By region, our 2019 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 8. Industry sales in U.S. and Canada are forecasted to be flat to up 5% for 2019. However, as near term fundamentals have weakened, we anticipate large ag industry sales to be on the lower end of that range with Canadian demand turning negative due to adverse weather and currency fluctuations and further complicated by tariffs on certain crops, such as canola and lentils.","Our small ag equipment compact tractors continued to show a strong order book for 2019, driven by healthy U.S. economy and GDP growth, while growth from midsized tractors is more modest due to the softness in the livestock and dairy sector.","Moving on to the EU 28, the industry outlook is forecast to be flat in 2019, stabilized by healthy margins for the arable and dairy sectors in the south and west regions, offsetting less favorable conditions in the north central and northeast regions. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be flat up 5% for the year with strength in Brazil balanced by slowness in Argentina on account of high inflation and political uncertainty.","Farmer sentiment remains quite positive in Brazil, which had a very strong first half of the year. Farm margins in the region continue to be supportive of equipment demand and sentiment has been boosted following record corn and soybean harvest in 2019. We experienced positive farmer sentiment at the recent Agri Show where equipment sales continued at healthy levels. Furthermore, this year\u2019s Agri Show featured the initial launch of our leading technologies to the Brazilian market, products such as Combine Advisor, Exact Emerge and Exact Apply were well received during their debut.","Shifting to Asia, industry sales are expected to be flat to slightly down as key growth markets slow modestly. Lastly, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2019 based on solid economic factors that are supported by continued consumer confidence.","Putting this all together on Slide 9, fiscal year 2019 sales of worldwide agriculture and turf equipment are now forecasted to be up approximately 2%, which includes a negative currency impact of about 3 points. The reduction from previous guidance relates to recent softness in the North American large ag and dairy markets, as well as our decision to under-produce retail for the remainder of the year. Furthermore, we\u2019re reducing our full year operating margin forecast from 12% to 11% to reflect unfavorable movements in volume and mix, as well as the impact of the lower production schedules. Also, the unfavorable impact of currency is over a point.","Before moving on to Construction & Forestry, I\u2019d like to acknowledge the challenging conditions that many of our customers are facing right now. As such, we\u2019d like to highlight a key initiative that is producing positive results for producers, and helping them better manage the many variables affecting their operations, even while end markets remain difficult. Over five years ago, the agriculture and turf division began executing the deliberate shift towards the crop production systems business model. This strategy reframed our approach to innovation and deeply impacted three primary areas of business; number one, our product portfolio planning; number two, our go-to-market strategy; and number three, the integration of precision ag technologies.","Our production system strategy ensures that innovation efforts focus on the entire system of producing a crop, leveraging the entire suite of Deere products from the field prep to planting, protecting and harvesting, driving tremendous value for our customers by maximizing yields and decreasing input costs. The results from this approach have been clear. Today, Deere is producing meaningfully differentiated technology and has achieved its highest North American market share in over a decade.","The strategy\u2019s first step involved in focusing efforts on product portfolios that optimize a crop system. To do this, we formed production system innovation teams organized by crops, such as corn, soy and small grains. These teams ensure innovation focuses on farming jobs that address our customers' biggest pain points and have the most potential to unlock value. The team then work across the various product platforms to allocate R&D investments accordingly.","Next, we engage our dealer channel to focus on the agronomic impact of our equipment. To do this, we conducted LEAD events around the country, LEAD standing for Leading Economic and Agronomic Decisions. These events hosted local customer demonstrations showing the agronomic impact of our technology and equipment. Today, many dealers now employ agronomist, and host their own LEAD events.","Lastly, our integrated precision ag technologies are the most critical enabler of our production system strategy. Today, John Deere is the global leader in precision agriculture and our unique combination of best-in-class machinery, dealer channel and advanced technologies deliver improved outcomes for every pass, every field and every season, bringing real value to farming operations with both reduced costs and increased yields.","Precision Ag is the common thread across each production step, helping farmers and helping producers to manage their operations. It allows farmers to use the same guidance line from planting to spraying, or leverage a common display interface through each step. Increasingly, agronomic data is driving farming decisions and our digital platform provides an opportunity to integrate data across all the production steps and to use it through the entire season to create real value.","The John Deere operations center is our digital platform that allows farmers to plan their work in the off season, monitor and control their operations in real-time and then analyze all the data. Today, we are the only ag OEM to have a comprehensive digital ecosystem, combining both agronomic and machine data into one application. Today, the operation center has over 145 million unique engaged acres in its system globally, leveraging data across each production step results in making decisions differently.","It also allows for the precise soil prep at the beginning of season. It makes each seed count in planting and gives every seed the best opportunity for success during the season. It makes every drop count in applications, adding the right amount at the right location, whether nutrient, herbicide, or pesticide. And lastly, it makes every grain and farming output count in harvesting so that farmers get maximum value from the work they\u2019ve done throughout the season. Even small changes in these items can produce tremendous value for our customers, driving better yield and lowering cost of their operations.","With each production step, equipment can use the data gathered from every pass as connected machines deliver data to the cloud. Simply put, each production step informs the next and subsequent steps can measure the outcomes of prior steps. In order to unlock the power of data, we've designed our digital systems to be as open as possible. Our systems, in other words, are compatible with those of many other industry players.","Openness is an easy thing to say but a more challenging thing to do. At John Deere, we\u2019re committed to growing our leadership position as the most open platform in the industry based on these three important factors: number one, customer control; number two, customer choice; and number three, compatibility. Our first guiding principle is that customers control their data, while Deere provides the most secured means to protect their privacy. That said, customers do not farm alone and often employ trusted advisors as an integral part of their operation and the decisions they make.","John Deere Operations Center gives customers the control to grant access to whomever they choose, providing secure collaboration environment for farmers. Regarding customer choice, the operation center maintains over 115 connected third-party providers. It provides unparalleled access to the industry leaders. From aerial image services to farm profitability providers, these connected partners make our digital platform more valuable and easier to use for customers.","Lastly, John Deere has a history of leading the industry in machine and technology compatibility. Thus, ensuring that our equipment works well in multi-colored fleets. We help pioneer the creation of standards that enable equipment interoperability, such as ISOBUS, the ADAPT standard and AgGateway. Our compatibility efforts also enable customers with mix fleets to bring their data into the operations center.","In summary, while we\u2019ve made great strides to-date, we\u2019re still in the early innings of executing this strategy. One of our next steps involves rolling out our latest technology to new markets, such as Brazil. As I mentioned, we\u2019re just now introducing Exact Emerge, Exact Apply and Combine Advisor to the Brazilian market, and have been very encouraged by the early results. We look forward to updating investors as we move ahead in these areas in the future.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Brent Norwood. Brent?","Brent Norwood","Thanks, Cory. Now, let\u2019s focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 11. Net sales of $2.99 billion were up 11%, a result of increased shipments and positive price realization for the quarter, partially offset by the negative impact of currency translation.","Operating profit was $347 million, largely benefiting from increased price realization, shipment volumes and a lower impact of Wirtgen purchase accounting, partially offset by higher production costs and less favorable product mix.","Moving to Slide 12, the economic drivers for the division remain broad based and supportive of continued equipment demand for the year. For 2019, total construction investment and housing starts are both slowing, but do remaining supportive. Meanwhile, oil and gas activity hovers at solid levels for equipment demand growth with oil prices firmly in the mid 60s, and infrastructure investments are growing at the state and local level. Furthermore, equipment rental utilization remains high, while rental rates continue to grow in 2019. Importantly, CapEx budgets from the independent rental companies continue at levels supportive of further equipment demand.","Lastly, global transportation investment this year is forecast to grow at about 4%, though results vary by market and product line. The overall positive economic indicators are reflected in a healthy order book, which is now extending into the fourth quarter.","Moving to the C&F outlook on Slide 13. Deere's Construction & Forestry 2019 sales are now forecasted to be up about 11% compared to last year, driven by strong demand for equipment, as well as an additional two months ownership of Wirtgen. Wirtgen's 2019 forecasted sales have been reduced slightly as certain geographies have slowed in recent months. The global Forestry market forecast is expected to be flat to up 5% with growth coming primarily from cut-to-length products in Europe and Russia. C&F\u2019s full year operating margin is projected to be about 11.5% with Wirtgen margins forecasted to be above that.","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operations. Slide 14 shows the provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average owned portfolio. The financial forecast for 2019 shown on the slide contemplates a loss provision of about 23 basis points. Current forecast puts loss provisions on par with the 10 year average and below the 15 year average.","Moving to Slide 15. Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $121 million in the second quarter. For the full year, in 2019, net income forecast is now $600 million compared to previous guidance to $630 million. The reduced forecast contemplates a higher provision for credit losses.","Slide 16 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter up $1.3 billion. In the C&F division, the second quarter increase is a result of a higher order book and production schedule, while the full year rise is largely attributable to a historically low field inventory position at the beginning of 2019. It's worth noting that our forecasted inventory to sales ratio is below the 10 year average.","For Ag, the quarter\u2019s increase is due to continued demand for small ag products, and a front-end loaded production schedule for large ag. By the end of the year, we forecast $50 million decrease in inventory and receivables compared to 2018 due to reduced production schedules.","Moving to Slide 17, cost of sales for the second quarter was 75% of net sales and our 2019 guidance is about 76%, down about a point from 2018. R&D was up about 10% in the second quarter and forecasted to be up 6% in 2019, or 5% when excluding Wirtgen. The year-over-year increase in 2019 primarily relates to strategic investments in precision ag, as well as next generation new product development programs for large ag product lines. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 1% in the quarter, and projected to be up about 6% for the full year or 5% excluding Wirtgen.","Turning to Slide 18. For the quarter, the equipment operations tax rate was 22% and the full year effective tax rate is still projected to be between 24% and 26%. Slide 19 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $4.1 billion in 2019, up from $3.3 billion in 2018.","The company\u2019s financial outlook is on Slide 20. Our full year outlook now calls for net sales to be up about 5% which includes about 3 points of price realization and one point related to an additional two months of Wirtgen ownership. On the negative side, we expect currency to be about a 3 point headwind for the year. Finally, our full year 2019 net income is now forecast at $3.3 billion.","I will now turn the call over to Ryan Campbell for closing comments. Ryan?","Ryan Campbell","Thanks Brent. Before we respond to your questions, I\u2019d like to share some thoughts on current ag industry fundamentals and our response to a very dynamic environment. First, it\u2019s important to acknowledge the confluence of difficulties impacting U.S. farmers in recent months.","In addition to persistent uncertainty around global trade and market access, grain framers are also contending with weather related planting delays and uncertain near term demand prospects due to African swine fever. The resulting decline in commodity prices have taken a toll on farmer sentiment and correspondingly our large ag sales forecast has countdown. Deere has historically been quick to respond to end market fluctuations, and we\u2019ve already taken action this year by reducing factory schedules.","Furthermore, we are actively identifying opportunities to further manage costs, while continuing to invest for the long term. Ultimately, these measures ensure we'll be best positioned at year end to respond to market dynamics in 2020. Importantly, the underlying fundamentals of replacement demand remain intact, even if the market faces current headwinds. As such, we expect a continued gradual recovery to resume once these challenges abate. The hours and age of the fleet along with the technology advancements included in our latest offerings will continue to drive demand.","As Cory noted, our production systems approach prioritizes investments that produce cost savings or yield enhancements for farmers. Many of the current pressures today illustrate the need for technology to help farmers adapt to an ever changing and fluid environment. Lastly, the long term positive fundamentals for agriculture remain enact, and we continue to see a growing need for technology to transform farming practices. Our proven ability to perform throughout the cycle combined with our leadership in precision agriculture give us confidence in our ability to deliver strong results over the long term for our customers and investors.","Josh Jepsen","Now, we\u2019re ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. In consideration of others and our hope to allow all of you to participate, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Angela?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Adam Uhlman","I was hoping we can start with the domestic farm equipment business. What are shipment volumes looking like? What were they here in the second quarter? What are you planning for the second half of the fiscal year? And then could you also talk about used equipment market trends, the weakness -- have we seen any weakness unfolding there? Thanks.","Josh Jepsen","If we start thinking about shipment volumes, as we think about the latter portion of the year with what we\u2019ve seen given the uncertainty and our move to reduce production levels, we'll see lower production shipments in the second half of the year. So that\u2019s definitely the case. I mean, if you look at couple of our larger facilities on a unit basis, they\u2019ll be down second half -- compared to second half of 2018 in the 20% range.","I think from a used perspective, we continue to see that market be stable. Pricing has been stable, I'd say by and large we\u2019re very comfortable with where we\u2019re at. And if you look at combines, there has been some conversation on combines ticking up. Seasonally, that\u2019s normal in that new retail combines are being sold and you\u2019re taking trades and those trades don\u2019t move until you get closer to the harvest. So we think that\u2019s a normal pattern, but we feel good about where we\u2019re at today.","A - Cory Reed","Adam, this is Cory. I was going to say that on the late model used, in particular, what we\u2019ve seen is high demand. If you look at volumes, they've come down since the 2014 timeframe. So you have a lot of the late-model used has been moved into the market and lot of folks are looking for late models. And that\u2019s driving what some of the continued demand in the market today is replacement demand is really holding the market in there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andy Casey","On the decision to under-produce -- to reduce inventory, is that isolated specifically to North America, or are there other regions also doing that. And the reason I ask is it looks like you\u2019re set up to hold margins for ag and turf in the second half in the mid 10% range despite that 20% down number. I\u2019m just wondering if there is any anything going on in other regions?","Josh Jepsen","Andy, when we look at that under production, I\u2019d say it\u2019s really North America and in large ag. In particular, there is maybe a little bit of that as you look at mid-size equipment but that is mostly a U.S. and Canada issue. Thank you. We\u2019ll go ahead and jump to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Chad Dillard","So with a tougher environment in large ag. To what extent are you changing the pricing assumptions, or funding allocated to any discounting or motions as we go into the 2020 early order programs for the planters and sprayers?","Josh Jepsen","As we think about pricing and as noted with our guidance, we haven\u2019t seen a change. So we\u2019re still expecting about 3 point of price with both divisions participating, so no major change there. I think a big part of that is continuing to manage used, and as we calibrate and reduce production levels that\u2019s all trying to keep that in balance. So I\u2019d say no major shift in terms of our view.","Cory Reed","No, I\u2019d agree. On the price side., we\u2019re holding through the remainder of the year, and we\u2019ll have very similar programs as we open up those early order programs going into next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Just color on potential cost cutting that you guys alluded to. Obviously, you\u2019re little more concerned about the market, we\u2019re cutting production levels. I mean what would you need to see to take actions on the cost side? And is this only if trade war stuff doesn\u2019t get resolved? I'm just trying to understand the opportunity and what levers you could pull? Thank you.","Cory Reed","I mean, I think as we\u2019ve gone through this before, always start certainly managing production levels and trying to manage field inventory and where we\u2019re at and what we want to deliver there. So that\u2019s certainly step one as we go through there. I think the cost side is the combination of continuing to invest in the long term. And how do we protect R&D and continue to invest in the product. Really good example of our view on that is as we went through \u201915 and '16, we continued investing in R&D and we\u2019re able to deliver products, like Combine Advisor and like the ExactApply and the sprayers that came out during that time that had we pulled too hard on those, may have been impacted.","So we want to take a long term view from an R&D perspective, but then, look, certainly they cost opportunities. So I think those are the things that we\u2019re continuously looking at, and then we\u2019ll be looking at regardless of the environment in terms of costs.","Ryan Campbell","I think one of the factors that you\u2019re seeing now, as we reduced production schedules. There's a bit of inefficiency that comes into our factories, and so that takes a little bit of time to work that out. And we\u2019re certainly committed to working that out. The other aspect on our SA&G budgets, we\u2019ll continue to look at those. But one aspect to that is we\u2019re investing in customer support initiatives in order to support all of the precision ag and production systems approach that Cory has alluded to and offers like connected support and expert alerts are truly differentiated in the industry. So we\u2019re going to be surgical about this. But for sure, we\u2019re taking a look at it and there\u2019s some opportunity certainly to the extent things potentially get worse.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Joe O'Dea","Related to Jamie\u2019s question, I think earlier in the year, you were talking about something in the area of around $850 million cost headwinds that you had in 2019, and tied to materials inflation and tariffs and supply chain constraints and currency, but when we think about things that you can manage. Can you give us any sense of the opportunities that you have within those cost headwinds to address some of them and quantify kind of what that opportunity set looks like, by how much you could take that down independent of what happens with currency, for example?","Cory Reed","Joe, I would say starting just at the high level we've talked about I think material and steel, in particular is progressing as we expected, because of the lagging of our contracts as we get into the third quarter on the ag and turf side on hot rolled coil, we start to see that come down. So you'd expect to see some of that benefit end of the third quarter and into fourth quarter. Now as we pull back production, you see the impact or benefit is dampened as a result of that. You also have the 301 tariffs that we've talked about from China. A quarter ago, we've talked about $100 million impact. We\u2019d say its somewhere between $75 million to $100 million, but that\u2019s a bit of a moving target right now, given some of the uncertainty of how and when that will be put into place, but that\u2019s considered there.","And then the other piece we\u2019ve talked about is then on the logistic side. So while by and large we\u2019ve seen less premium freight, we continue to have some critical components that we\u2019re bringing in that we have air freight. As noted a quarter ago, that will continue into the third quarter. And overall, there has been just higher rates for freight as a result of availability and really low unemployment. So those will be the things that we\u2019ve been talking about that have impacted us, and refers to the initial part of your question there, Joe.","I think as Ryan just mentioned on cost, something that we are always looking at, continuing to look at. I don\u2019t know that we want to talk about or quantify what could be. But I think there is continued focus in terms of how do we do that, both from the material side, as well as from cost structure SA&G and the like. Thank you, we\u2019ll go ahead and go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Courtney Yakavonis","Just wanted to clarify on the executions for under-production in the second half, I just want to make sure that I heard it down 20%. And then secondly, just wanted to also make sure that is assuming that there is no trade resolution in the back half of the year. And that obviously, the AFS situation persists. I just wanted to understand, is there any upside risk. If there is a trade resolution that you could change those production plans, or is that kind of set in stone at this point?","Joshua Jepsen","So, I\u2019d say as we think about what\u2019s going on with the forecast, I would say we\u2019re not assuming trade resolution. I think from a quarter ago to today, trade uncertainty has persisted plus the wet weather conditions and then things like ASF that are impacting near term demand. So those are all contemplated. We\u2019ve not assumed -- we get resolution at this point. And as a result, this is why we are taking down production in an effort to calibrate our field inventory and where we want to end the year to position ourselves for 2020. The only thing I\u2019d point out on that comment on the 20%, that\u2019s a couple of our factories this is an example of large ag factory, so that\u2019s not broadly across the entire division. But on a production unit basis, that\u2019s the magnitude we are seeing in the few of our larger facilities. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Tim Thein with Citi. Your line is open.","Tim Thein","First, Cory, maybe just I want to make sure I have clarified your comments early on pricing. You alluded it. As we think about pricing for '20 and something like a very similar program, I think you said. You don\u2019t mean -- I mean it\u2019s early but you\u2019re not anticipating similar levels of price increases for '20. Is that correct or I just want to make sure\u2026","Cory Reed","Tim, my comment was related to the early order programs that we\u2019d see very similar early order programs that we\u2019ve run in the past. That was the comment.","Josh Jepsen","No, commentary on pricing at this point and what we expect in the upcoming year.","Tim Thein","And Josh maybe just quickly on Wirtgen. You're two quarters in a row, obviously, the global economic environment has moved around a bit. But some of the other players in that general market have kind of been holding more steady, so in terms of their commentary, maybe just a sentence or two on Wirtgen and what changed there from a geographic perspective?","Josh Jepsen","So our Wirtgen outlook is down about $100 million in sales, and about half of that\u2019s FX related. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s really, Tim, looking at the markets that we mentioned before, China, Turkey, Argentina, Russia. And then we have seen some mix shifting in markets like India, which is -- we\u2019re actually seeing movement out of concrete paving into asphalt. So from the market share perspective, no change for Wirtgen but you see from a ticket price shift there. But that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve seen with Wirtgen thus far. And probably important to note there too, the margin forecast there has held unchanged from previous quarters. So even with some of that reduction, they pulled some levers and done some things to hold their margin performance, which we feel really good about. So thank you, and we'll go ahead and go to the next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","I'm wondering if you can comment and just build a comfort level around this production cut getting everything done that we need to in ag in terms of rightsizing the channel. Maybe comment on how order trends have played out over the course of the quarter, any other data points you'd share on just to build our comfort level that we won\u2019t be looking at couple of more production cuts to adjust for the current demand environment?","A - Josh Jepsen","As we look at production levels and what we\u2019re doing to calibrate those. I mean really the idea there is that we are pulling back. It\u2019s based on what\u2019s been happening in the market, what we've seen from order flows. So for large tractors, for example, we're ordered out through September, which is about a month less than we would have been a year ago. So that has impacted that view. Cory mentioned we\u2019ve seen some weakness in Canada also that impacts some of our larger products like combines and like four wheel drive tractors. So I think a few of those things have impacted what we\u2019ve seen there. But I\u2019d say that\u2019s the view. And as I noted with Courtney\u2019s question, we\u2019re not baking in trade resolution. So I would say we\u2019re thinking what we think is a balanced view here, but shifting to where do we want to be ending 2020 to position ourselves well given the dynamics of what 2020 could be. Thank you we go to the next question.","Operator","Next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Raso","Just wanted to be clear the set up for ag and turf going into \u201920. I think the company used to feel high horsepower ag 2020 would be a recovery year. The way you\u2019re targeting your inventory exiting this year, if we just kept it simple and said next year was flat, let\u2019s just say. Would production be in line with retail? I'm just trying to get comfortable with the set up going into '20 on how you\u2019re now targeting your ending inventory?","Josh Jepsen","David, you\u2019re right. And the idea being this under-production this year sets us up to be in a position to produce to retail, that\u2019s always where we target to be. As we\u2019ve seen we have uncertainty persist here as we\u2019ve made these adjustments that\u2019s shifted but that\u2019s the idea. We want to be in a position that we\u2019re producing to retail next year. So thank you. We\u2019ll go ahead and jump to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ross Gilardi","I was just wondering and we\u2019ve heard a lot about how the trade war obviously is impacting in the U.S. farmer, and the Brazilian farmers been on either more of the winning end of that. But what about the European farmer, you talked about rising end stocks for wheat. Now, you\u2019re seeing more cautious trends there at all in the core European markets of Germany and France due to rising wheat inventories. And just what does your European order book look like?","Josh Jepsen","So our view on that market is relatively flat, and I think our order book would be in line with that or supportive of that view. As you think about the trade war and puts and takes there, I think I\u2019d say they\u2019ve been benefited, not to the extend say the Brazilian farmer, but benefited through exports, particularly pork but also dairy going into China. So, I think that\u2019s been supportive. Some of that this year -- prospects looks better because of drought last year. So by enlarge, I think the overall environment there is better with the uncertainty overhang in Europe really on Brexit, and what does that mean for the longer-term.","Ryan Campbell","I think maybe a slide shift but nothing significant right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sameer Rathod with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Sameer Rathod","There seems to be more political discussion around the National Right to Repair Law. Can you help us understand the impact that could have on the company's top line or margins?","Josh Jepsen","So Right to Repair has been in the news a lot. And I think for us it's important to really carve out two issues that are typically embedded in that conversation. One is Right to Repair and we would say we\u2019re supportive of our customers' ability and their ability to repair their machines. So we work with the AEM to support access to service tools, agnostic tools and the ability to repair. So we would not have any issue or concern with that matter. Right to Modify and when you get into modifying actual code, we think that\u2019s a bigger concern as you get into things like safety and emissions and a lot of other components that would be more concerning. So I think we would delineate between those two. And I'll ask Cory to add his comments.","Cory Reed","Sameer, I would say we\u2019re leading the industry in offering great tools to both our customers and repairs of equipment that can get in and keep our customers up and running, uptime is a big deal. So we want to give our customers the opportunity to repair what they can themselves. Also, to use who they want to. But at the same time, we worked to build the dealer network that's best in the industry. It\u2019s keeping them up and running all the time. So we feel strongly about giving them all the tools they need and are leading the industry in the Right to Repair space of providing those tools out to the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.","Robert Wertheimer","You\u2019ve been quite clear, but I still just wanted to go back to the high horsepower large equipment side, and just make sure I understand how the business is working in and what you\u2019re trimming. You build most stuff to order, I think and you referenced you\u2019re one month shorter on the outlook than you had been. And so you're building to order but the production is down, and there's 20% fall. So what is falling? Is it just a little bit of clean up of excess inventory that\u2019s not to order and the rest of its chugging along as it is, or am I misunderstanding something?","Josh Jepsen","I think there is a combination. I mean some is you\u2019ve got some geographic distribution areas that are maybe a little bit weaker than others are seeing some impacts. We\u2019ve talked about some of the challenges in Canada, for example, and some other parts of the country. So some of it is just working through some of those things, and I think that\u2019s the biggest piece of that. So I think nothing materially different in terms of how we've seen that activity transpire. Thank you. We\u2019ll go ahead and go to our next caller.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry De Maria with William Blair. Your line is open.","Larry De Maria","A question given the adjustment to the guidance, as it relate to last night's announcement, cancellation of U.S. pork inputs to China, which is independent of ASF. Has that factored into your outlook, or should we think about maybe incremental risk in the midsize range? Just curious how you'd describe maybe midsize as you\u2019ve gone through the large size and what the incremental risk from pork exports and other things like that not going to China, which is maybe incremental to [soybeans] [ph]?","Josh Jepsen","Obviously, very new news so not contemplated in our forecast. But what I\u2019ll tell you is with ASF really ramp -- the implications ramping up over the last month or so, we haven\u2019t seen a material shift or change in our midsize tractors or hand forged equipment. So I think right now I\u2019d say we didn\u2019t have upside or downside implied there based on what\u2019s going on with the pork, ASF or broadly any retaliation with China. Cory?","Cory Reed","I would say the broader impact in our mid range has been from the continuing challenges in the dairy market in the U.S., and that\u2019s already been reflected in what we\u2019re doing there. So I don\u2019t anticipate a large impact from the announcement last night.","Josh Jepsen","I think that announcement probably benefits EU back to the other question, EU pork probably see increased exports as a result of that and probably see some incrementally from Brazil as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Fisher","Just curious what this year\u2019s experience is telling you about the bigger picture of the replacement cycle. Are we back to the old adage of equipment really just lasting one more year and farmers are just going to run it until they break? And then what did you contemplate for retail sales in 2020 at this point with that 20% production cut?","Josh Jepsen","So we obviously don\u2019t have a guide on 2020 particularly in the dynamic market we\u2019re in right now. So I think that\u2019s probably starting point. As you think about replacement demand, we do believe the drivers of replacement demand remain intact, and that\u2019s hours and age on equipment and technology and productivity. I think what we\u2019re seeing today is a bit of a pause as a result of the uncertainties that are out there, but we feel like those drivers are still there. And as we work through some of these short term uncertainties, you see the resumption of that replacement demand. One thing that I would point out is -- I think one thing we see through the technology and the ability to take down input cost through using precision technologies. There\u2019s appetite to invest in those things that can help reduce breakevens and improve profitability that certainly are important.","Cory Reed","No, I would agree. And in fact I mentioned earlier that what we\u2019ve seen -- used the example of the combine market is that our late model combine used inventory is running lower, and that\u2019s really driving the replacement demand side. If you start to think of the technology changes that occurred in the last three or four years, 2014 forward, there's a lot of technology that\u2019s enhancing the productivity of those machines and there\u2019s demand at the top end of the market to bring it in.","Ryan Campbell ","If we look at the fleets aging out another year, at the end of 2019, high horsepower tractors 220 plus and four wheel drives, are going to be back to 2007 age levels, same with combines. So it's just another year and its aging out. And as soon as some of these uncertainties abate, we will see a gradual recovery in replacement demand given the factors of age and technology adoption.","Josh Jepsen","Maybe one last thing to add is the importance of up-time accentuated even more. And in times like this right now, we\u2019ve got a really short planting window, because of weather patterns. So as we can -- obviously newer machines but then connected support and other things deliver more uptime as these windows tighten. And I think that\u2019s increasingly important for the customers. So thank you. We\u2019ll go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is open.","Mig Dobre","I want to talk a little bit about C&F, a question with two parts, if you would. So on your outlook, you lowered the top line by about 2 points and then it looks like about half of that came from Wirtgen. I\u2019m trying to understand the other half. And then on Wirtgen specifically, I\u2019m looking to understand how you view the full year revenue, so the full year revenue contraction. And I asked that because it looks to me like your margin guidance implies very solid margins in the back half versus what you\u2019ve done in the front half. So how much risk is there at this point to that Wirtgen margins? Thanks.","Josh Jepsen","So, I think as you think about the overall C&F, you\u2019re right in terms of reduction. You have about half Wirtgen, we\u2019ve talked about that about half of that half, so a quarter is really FX driven, if you look at the legacy C&F business. I\u2019d say the biggest individual piece of that was where we saw weakness in Canada where it's been a few different impacts, Oil and gas, we\u2019ve seen production come down in Canada specifically a little bit, demand for lumber, because of the slowing of housing starts in the U.S. has impacted Canadian lumber as well. So, I think those have been -- those would be the major drivers of what we've seen on the top line.","And it relates to Wirtgen, as we\u2019ve talked about before, 3Q is their bigger quarter in terms of revenue and margin. And the second quarter came in strong, I\u2019d say as we expected and maybe worth noting in this year with Bauma that falls into the third quarter for Wirtgen. So maybe you see that impact. We saw a good response to the show very positive reaction to their new products. So we continue to feel good about that business, the long-term prospect but also as we talked about no change in our view on margins for the full year.","Ryan Campbell","As Josh said, Bauma years can have a little bit slower start, but we feel really good about how the show went. And then if we take a step back and look at how they performed for each quarter compared to their historical averages and looking what they need to deliver for the rest of the year, its roughly in line with they\u2019ve delivered historically. So we feel comfortable about where we are with them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","I think I'll switch gears and maybe take a step back and ask the question about the fundamentals. Can you comment on the notion that the future is bright for global demand, given the unprecedented 30% plus or minus reduction in the herd size in China? And plus the potential that the U.S. export market is more permanently damaged, particularly with South America producing near record crops this year. I mean have you contemplated at all the fact that this maybe more permanent than just a six month production cut?","Josh Jepsen","I\u2019ll start there, Ann, this is Josh. I mean, I think when we say we think it\u2019s early to model or say we\u2019ve seen permanent shift in production or market share globally, I think importantly, we support open markets for our customers and their ability to compete globally. I think in that same vein, we really like our positioning, particularly in those production systems of big grains, corn, soybeans and small grains. So we like how we\u2019re positioned there from a global basis. I think as you think about ASF and the impact there, it\u2019s obviously early there. We do expect that herd size I think as of March was down about 20%. So certainly I think there\u2019s some near term impact there in terms of the demand. However, what we\u2019re seeing is and we\u2019ve seen exports from many different countries and different regions of pork moving pretty quickly to China, whether it\u2019s from U.S. or Brazil or from China -- from Europe.","Cory Reed","Ann, this is Cory. I would say we see those. The latest forecast would say that the global demand is still going to rise year-over-year. We feel like we\u2019re in the best positions in those markets that produce grain around the world as we\u2019ve continued to build out the competitiveness of the North American farmer with technology. We\u2019re doing the same now in Brazil. Our focus on two things, creating the most competitive output, so on a bushel or an acre basis, or a hectare basis in different parts of the world. And then investing in things that help differentiate our customers to grow more yield at that lower cost point. So I think we\u2019re positioned well and the demand is holding in there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jeffries. Your line is open.","Steve Volkmann","Most of my questions have been answered. But Josh, can I just ask you on the Slide 16 when you talk about your receivables and inventory. If I'm reading this right on a constant currency basis, you\u2019re actually up about $550 million from your previous forecast. But we've talked a lot about getting production. So maybe can you just square that up for us?","A - Josh Jepsen","So as we talked about -- we talk a lot about what we\u2019re doing on large ag side, and you see some reduction there on the ag side of the business. On the construction and forestry side, compared to where we were it is up. And I think that\u2019s really driven by where we started the year. We came into the year at historically low inventory to sales ratios levels. And even with where we\u2019re going to end or where we project to end this year, we\u2019re below our ten year average on inventory to sales. So I think it\u2019s driven by where we started new customer and dealer demand and comfort level as they pull to get the levels that they\u2019re comfortable with.","And we\u2019re going to continue to monitor that, but that\u2019s really the view is we\u2019re seeing strong enough demand and dealers comfort level with their inventory levels and trying to get there. And as you recall, we had hoped to build some inventory in both '17 and '18 but strong demand impeded that. So we actually drew down. We were at historically low levels in both of those years. So you see us really coming back from that. All right, thanks Steve. We\u2019ll go ahead and go to our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Seth Weber","Just wanted to get a litter bit color on this big step down in the finco profitability in the second quarter and just your comp -- your full year guide implies that snaps back pretty quickly in the third quarter and fourth quarter. So just trying to get a better understanding as to what happened and why that\u2019s going to come back to you quickly. Thanks.","Josh Jepsen","So when we think about our JDF guidance -- we talk about in total, if we think about the full year, we came down about $30 million, really driven by two things, provision as well as tax rate. So tax has moved a little bit on us, that\u2019s one. And then the provision would be the bigger component of that. Provision is really driven by I\u2019d say two major components. One would be our growth in our international portfolio. So as our international portfolio has grown, particular markets like Argentina, Brazil, China, and India, you see the provision move with that. And then the other would be on our multi-use account or revolving credit. So that\u2019s been the other driver.","So as you think about the multi-use, the revolving credit, we take a conservative approach there in that we write off 100% of those balances when they go 90 days past due. Historically, we see strong recoveries post write offs. And in times of stress in the industry, we\u2019ve continued to produce really strong returns in that portfolio. So we think underlying there, we see strong customer fundamentals, some of this I think really driven by just seasonality, as well as what we've seen with commodity prices, number of folks haven\u2019t marketed their grains. So there are few different dynamics there. And I\u2019ll ask Cory to comment too.","Cory Reed","I think the thing in this to keep in mind is that we\u2019ve been running at write-off level significantly below. Our averages have been over 10 year or 15 year period. And the adjustment that we\u2019re taking now puts us right in line between the 10 and 15 year average on write offs and the provisions. So my take on it is it\u2019s a really solid portfolio that despite what we have in terms of headwinds in the industry, we see write offs stay in line with our averages historically, which means we have a stronger portfolio today as we have in the past.","Josh Jepsen","And maybe one last thing to just to note on that as we think about the multi-use and that driving the big change in the provision. Overall, our portfolio has grown about 8% and the multi use component is going at a lower rate, it\u2019s about 3% growth this year.","Cory Reed","And about 7% of the total portfolio. So thank you, we\u2019ll go ahead and take one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is open.","Stanley Elliott"," Can you talk about the engaged acres on a regional basis and then how quickly can some of these technologies start to drive that engaged component in South America and other markets?","Cory Reed","I mentioned that we have 145 million. We started first in the North American market, and that\u2019s where predominant number of those acres reside today. But the fastest growing engaged acres are places like Brazil see things building out communications network that allow our machine population get connected. We\u2019re taking more technologies in. I mean it\u2019s incredible to see the growth rates around the world. The European market guidance technologies have adopted very fast in a very fast pace, and now we have connectivity and growing across those acres.","The real opportunity is what I mentioned in the production system discussion, customers move from farming to understanding how each pass impacts their cost structure and profitability. And we\u2019re now generating both the data and insights that allow them to evaluate those on a near real-time basis. So really big opportunities for both yield growth and cost management on the customer side being driven off of those engaged acres.","Josh Jepsen","And one thing I\u2019d note, Stanley, is $145 million engaged acres. That includes acres in all four regions, as you think about how we about the world divided up into four, a little over 105 million in North America. So to Cory\u2019s point, we are seeing growth in that outside of North America piece. And as discussed, it\u2019s not just an absolute number in terms of growth in acres, it's the depth. And we think as we offer full solutions across production system, there\u2019s opportunity to have deeper engagement there in the operations center.","Cory Reed","If you look right now, I mean planters are lit up all around -- prior to last night\u2019s rain, planters have been lit up all around the country, and that\u2019s taking place. And you can see those acres coming in and being able to evaluate down to the individual seed level what their placement, what their depth, what their singulation, it allows them to understand how they invest in nutrients going forward that ultimately as they close the loop in harvesting and they take that section in and evaluate both their cost structure and yield that they will improve again year-over-year. So the opportunity is growing and more and more customers are adopting the technology that\u2019ll help drive their business forward and competitiveness forward.","Josh Jepsen","Thank you. Well, with that, we\u2019ll conclude the call. I appreciate everyone\u2019s time, and we will be talking soon. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session of today's conference.","I would now like to turn over the call to Mr. Josh Jepsen, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Josh Jepsen","Hello, good morning. Also on the call today are Ryan Campbell, our Chief Financial Officer; Luke Chandler, Chief Economist; and Brent Norwood, Manager of Investor Communications. Today, we will take a closer look at your third quarter earnings and spend some time talking about our markets and our current outlook for fiscal 2019. After that, we will respond to your questions.","Please note that slides are available to complement the call this morning. They can be accessed on our Web site at www.johndeere.com\/earnings.","First, a reminder, this call is being broadcast live on the Internet and recorded for future transmission and use by Deere & Company.

Brent?","Brent Norwood","John Deere completed the third quarter with results reflecting a higher degree of uncertainty over the agricultural sector in North America. Concerns over market access, near-term demand for commodity, and weather continue to challenge the industry and have partially overshadowed a heightened outlook for farm incomes in the U.S. Meanwhile, some foreign markets such as Brazil have showed continued signs of strength as strong crop production and increased exports have benefited the local industry.","In construction and forestry, end market demand remained strong, resulting from broad-based industry drivers such a GDP growth, oil and gas activity, and infrastructure investments. With order books extending through most of the fourth quarter, the division is on track for a solid finish to the year. Now, let's take a closer look at our third quarter results beginning on slide three. Net sales and revenue were down 3% to $10 billion.","Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $899 million or $2.81 per diluted share. The results included a favorable benefit to the provision for income taxes due to U.S. tax reform. Excluding this item, adjusted net income was $867 million or $2.71 per diluted share.","On slide four, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 3% to $8.969 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by three points while currency translation was negative by two points.","Turning to our review of our individual businesses starting with agriculture & turf on slide five, net sales were down 6% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison primarily driven by lower shipment volumes and the negative impact of currency translation, partially offset by positive price realization.","Operating profit was $612 million, resulting in a 10.3% operating margin for the division. The year-over-year decline was due to lower shipment volumes, higher product cost, and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, partially offset by positive price realization.","At this point, I would like to welcome to the call our chief economist Luke Chandler to discuss the fundamentals affecting the ag business. Luke?","Luke Chandler","Thanks, Brent. Good morning all. 2019 is proving to be a mixed year for global agriculture. Increasing demand, some higher prices, and government support programs are helping to offset the uncertainties caused by trade disputes, weather setbacks, and disease disruption.","As shown on slide six, global stocks of major grain and oil seeds are forecasted fall 3% in 2019 - 2020. Major farm economies around the world are expected to be mostly on par or slightly improved in 2019 year-over-year. While ongoing market access issues have been detrimental to the North American farmer confidence, increased export opportunities emerged for farmers in other parts of the world notably Brazil and Argentina. Turning now to take a closer look at some of the key agricultural economies around the world, beginning with the United States where 2019 has been a volatile one for farmers particularly those in the Corn Belt. The U.S. row crop sector started the year with the USDA forecasting corn ending stocks at the highest level in over 30 years.","Soybean ending stocks at near record levels and the smallest amount of wheat acreage planted in U.S. history. As the planting season progressed, cold spring temperatures and the wettest 12-month period in U.S. history brought flooding and record planting delays across major corn and soybean growing regions. The result was heightened on uncertainty around row crop production. This uncertainty was reflected in the USDA\u2019s latest estimates released this past Monday which surprised the market particularly the forecast of national corn production.","It is worth remembering that there is quite a lot of time remaining in the growing season. In addition to some improvement in prices earlier in the summer, the USDA in May 2019 announced the second round of the market facilitation program or MFP which includes up to $14.5 billion in direct payment to the U.S. farmers.","Higher levels of uncertainty regarding final planted and harvested acreage, yield, and MSP details have contributed to wide swing in farmer sentiments throughout the season.","Looking ahead to the rest of the crop season, trade uncertainty continues to dampen sentiment across the U.S. farm economy. That said, the impact of the second round of MFP payments leads to forecast the U.S. farm cash received in 2019 as shown on slide seven although full benefit of higher receipts on industry demand maybe somewhat delayed or dampened by the current uncertain environment.","Up north of the board of the Canadian farm economy continues to be challenged by lower farm income in 2018 and the overhang of an ongoing trade dispute with China. Wheat prices continued to be pressured by abundant levels of supplies while canola growers fight ongoing Chinese restrictions on imports. As a result, Canadian major crop area and cash receipts are expected to decline yet again this year. And Canadian farmers are proceeding cautiously with new equipment investments even though balance sheet remains solid. On a positive note, this year's profit is benefiting from light season rain after a dry start of the season, modestly improving the needs and farmer sentiment.","Moving down to South America, as shown on slide eight, the 2018 - 19 season marked a record year for combine corn and soya production. Rising global demand for grains and oil seeds is also driving the exports forecast to record higher level encouraging prospect for next season as well.","In Brazil, the 2019 value of production in local currencies for key grains and oil seeds and sugarcane is expected to be nearly 10% higher than last year. Brazilian farmers are seeking to capitalize on expanded trade opportunities not only in soybean but also in meat products with exports of beef, pork, and poultry all tracking higher on a year-over-year basis.","From an equipment demand perspective, the budget shortfall for the motor further [ph] poised industry demand earlier in the year. However, the budget has since been replenished for the new crop year. Overall, the 2019-20 harvest plan is viewed as supportive for the ag sector and equipment demand. Meanwhile Argentinian farmers -- sorry, meanwhile Argentinian farm conditions have rebounded strongly from last season's historic drought. The value of 2019 production is expected to be over 30% higher year-over-year. While ag fundamentals remain solid, political uncertainties create the challenging environment for Argentine financial markets more generally.","Still in the southern hemisphere, widespread drought in Australia continues to be the dominant issue shaping the farm economy Down Under. On the East Coast, drought is expected to result in a third consecutive below average winter grain crop albeit southern growing regions have improved from last year. Cotton production is also expected to be significantly lower this year due to constrained water allocation.","Conditions on the West Coast has held up much better in recent season and farmers here will be looking for spring rain to finish off this season's winter grain crop. In the EU, the macroeconomic outlook remains clouded by ongoing uncertainty regarding Brexit and whether a deal will be reached between the U.K. and the EU before the October 31 deadline. In the EU agricultural economy conditions are mixed across Europe with grain production expected to recover from last season's drought affected crops.","USCI's latest forecast has wheat production up over 10% despite challenges like excessively high temperatures and the lack of rainfall in parts. Core ag markets like France are expected to rebound as a result although the outlook has been tempered by the ensuing lower prices. Looking at the important EU dairy sector, farm incomes which were strained last year in drought condition are expected to benefit from a combination of largely stable prices and lower feed cost in 2019.","Moving over the Black Sea region, the current harvest outlook is more favorable than last year with production forecast to be up 3.5% in Russia and nearly 16% in the Ukraine. Wrapping up, while we do see some improvement in farm economies in most major producing regions in 2019, the backdrop of continued high uncertainty and volatility is expected to weigh on the outlook for the ag machinery sector.","By region at 2019, Ag and Turf industry outlooks are summarized on slide nine. Ag industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be flat to 2019, with the decrease in guidance reflecting the previously mentioned uncertainty in the market. Moving to the EU 28 and the industry outlook is also forecast to be flat in 2019, as the production recovery is tempered by somewhat lower small grain process.","In South America, industry sales of practice and combines a project to be flat to up 5% for the year with strength in Brazil balanced by slowness in Argentina, due to the previously mentioned political and economic uncertainty. Shifting to Asia, industry sales are expected to be flat to slightly down as key market growth -- as key growth slow monitoring. Lastly, industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2019 based on solid macroeconomic factors, notably continued consumer confidence.","I will now turn the call back to Brent Norwood. Brent?","Brent Norwood","Thanks, Luke. Before moving to the 2019 Ag and Turf forecast, I'll provide an update on the first phase of our 2020 planter and sprayer earlier program. As Luke already mentioned, planting was significantly delayed this season, as persistent rains kept farmers out of the fields for weeks. As a result, planting was still underway during the first phase of our earlier program, which negatively impacted early sales progress. Subsequently, we believe this year's phase one results are less indicative of the overall program, since many sales may push to phases two or three. In that context, phase one orders for planters exceeded our expectations with units flat compared to last year.","Importantly, the overall sales value is higher due to an uptick on take rates for our most advanced technology and larger planters, so driving increased equipment prices. More than ever this season underscores the immense value of seed and precise placement of the seed while planting. Anecdotally, we heard many examples of customers who were able to plant thousands of acres over a tight three-day window due solely to the use of our exact emerge planter. These anecdotes, minds with the increased take rates from our early order program, demonstrate customer willingness to make investments when the value proposition is strongest.","As for the phase one results of our sprayer program. Orders varied significantly between the U.S. and Canada. And the program's overall order book ended down double-digits in the first phase compared to last year. As previously mentioned, conditions in Canada remain challenged due to adverse weather conditions both last season and in this season, as well as FX weakness, and trade barriers on canola.","With the skew of Canadian equipment mix towards larger highly featured machines, its impact on the first phase was significant. Sprayer volumes were also down in the U.S., but to a lesser extent than in Canada. The U.S. results were negatively impacted by a tough year-over-year cost in 2018 and delayed spraying the season. It's important to note that customers were just beginning to spray near the end of phase one of our earlier program, driving customers to differ order activity until gaining further clarity on this year's crop.","Moving on to our Ag and Turf forecast on slide 10. Fiscal year 2019 sales of worldwide Ag and Turf equipment are now forecasted to be up approximately 2%, which includes a negative currency impact of about two points. Our full-year operating margin forecast is now 10.5% to reflect the previously discussed uncertainty lingering in the U.S., as well as the broadly unfavorable market conditions in Canada, additionally, the negative margin impact of currency development for the year.","Now, let's focus on construction and forestry on slide 11. Net sales of about $3 billion, we're up 1%, primarily due to positive price realization for the quarter partially offset by the negative impact of currency translation. Operating profit was $378 million benefiting from increased price realization and a lower impact of Wirtgen purchase accounting partially offset by a less favorable product mix.","Moving to slide 12, the economic drivers for the division continue to remain supportive of equipment demand for the year. For 2019, while growth and total construction investment and housing starts has slowed, both remain at overall solid levels for equipment demand. Meanwhile, oil and gas activity continued at solid levels, with oil prices firmly in the 50s and 60s and infrastructure investments are continuing at the state and local level.","Furthermore, equipment rental utilization rate remains high while rental rates continue to grow into 2019. Importantly CapEx budgets from the independent rental companies continue at level supportive of further equipment demand. Back then global transportation investment this year is forecasted to grow at about 5%, so growth rates vary by market. The overall positive economic indicators are reflected in a healthy order book which now extends through most of the fourth quarter.","Moving to the C&F outlook on slide 13, Deere's Construction & Forestry 2019 sales are now forecasted to be up about 10% compared to last year driven by strong demand for equipment as well as an additional two months of ownership of Wirtgen. Wirtgen's 2019 sales are forecasted to be about $3.2 billion and certain geographies have slowed in recent months. The global forestry market forecast is expected to be flat to up 5% with growth coming primarily from custom linked products in Europe and in Russia. C&F's full-year operating margin is projected to be about 11% with Wirtgen margins in line with the overall division.","Let's move now to our financial services operation. Slide 14 shows the provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average loan portfolio, the financial forecast for 2019 shown on the slide contemplates a loss provision of about 18 basis points, the current forecast puts loss provisions below the 10-year average and below the 15-year average as well.","Moving to slide 15, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $175 million in the third quarter. For the full-year in 2019, net income forecast is now $620 million compared to previous guidance of $600 million. The higher forecast contemplates a lower tax rate.","Slide 16 outlines receivables and inventory. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories entered the quarter up was about $1.1 billion. In the C&F division, the third quarter increase is a result of a higher order book and production schedules for the full-year rise is largely attributable to a historically low field inventory position at the start of 2019. It's worth noting that our forecasted inventory to sales ratio is in line with historic averages. For the quarter increase is due to recent weakness in Canada and deferred retail demand into Brazil as customers anticipated the new program. By the end of year, we forecast a $100 million increase in inventory and receivables.","Moving to slide 17, cost of sales for the third quarter was 77% of net sales and our 2019 guidance is about 77% in line with 2018 results. R&D was up about 4% in the third quarter and forecasted to be up 6% in 2019 or 5% excluding Wirtgen. The year-over-year increase 2019 primarily relates to strategic investments in precision ag as well as next generation large ag products. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 2% in the quarter and projected to be up about 4% for the full year. The decrease in guidance relates in part to a decrease in incentive compensation.","Turning to slide 18, the third quarter included -- third quarter included a $24 million benefit to the provision for income taxes resulting in a 21% tax rate for the period. The full-year effective tax rate is now projected to be between 23% and 25%.","Slide 19 shows our equipment operation is strong cash. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $3.4 billion in 2019. The reduced guidance reflects a potential $300 million voluntary contribution to our OpEx plan.","Company's financial outlook is on slide 20. Our full-year outlook now calls for net sales to be about 4% which includes about three points of price realization and one point related to an additional two months of Wirtgen ownership. On the negative side, we expect the currency to be about a two point headwind for the full-year. Finally, our full-year 2019 net income is now forecasted to be at in our forecast to be $3.2 billion.","I will now turn the call over to Ryan Campbell for closing comments. Ryan?","Ryan Campbell","Thanks, Brent. Before we respond to your questions, I'd first like to discuss our use of cash priorities and then provide some perspective on our financial performance, given the persistent uncertainty in the market. Like near-term fluctuations in end markets, our use of cash priorities remained the same. We continue to generate strong cash flow throughout the cycle.","Importantly, our capital allocation decisions continue to first support our A rating, while also ensuring that we effectively fund operating and growth needs. Next, we will maintain a dividend payout ratio that targets 25% to 35% of mid-cycle earnings and can be sustained through the cycle.","Note that we've increased our dividend by 25% over the last two years and that further increases will be under consideration as we demonstrate progress to our increased profitability goals.","Lastly, during the quarter, we repurchased $400 million of stock and we will continue to buy when we can create value for long-term shareholders.","Now regarding our financial performance, I want to note that we've significantly invested in next generation large ag products and accelerated our precision ag initiatives. Although while diversifying our construction and forestry division through the Wirtgen acquisition.","Additionally, we increased our infrastructure spending to gain efficiencies and modernize systems and enhance our dealer and customer engagement. Beginning in 2017, momentum has built in our ag business in the initial part of our 2019 early order program, which occurred in the summer of 2018 indicated an acceleration of replacements demand. As such, we took the steps required to meet the projected incremental demand.","Unfortunately, North American customer sentiment has since deteriorated only due to uncertainty over market access, but also due to weather and the demand impact of African swine fever as these challenges persist, we are now beginning more aggressive action on our cost structure to create a more efficient and nimble organization. These actions which will involve organizational efficiency, a footprint assessment, and an increased focus on investments with the most opportunity for differentiation are in support of our aspiration to achieve 15% structural operating profits by 2022. And will position us to capitalize upon the resumption of replacement demand growth.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks, Ryan. Now we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the following procedures in consideration of others and hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Angela?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.","Robert Wertheimer","Hey, it's Rob. Can you hear me?","Josh Jepsen","Yes, we can hear you, Rob.","Robert Wertheimer","I'm so sorry about that. I hit the wrong button. Question is really just as you look into your potential cost savings plan you've also had a nice focus on innovation and maybe a spending policy on innovation, so could you talk about the next, you know, really two or three years on R&D? I mean you are seeing more and more projects that can generate a good return for you and therefore maybe keep that spend high and the cuts are in other areas, or maybe just balance that aspect? Thanks.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. Thanks, Rob. This is Josh, I'll start. I think as we think about this, and as Ryan noted, it was the continued focus on those things that we think drive the most differentiation and most value creation for our customers, and you've really seen -- so that over the last few years as we've been investing in things like Blue River technology and features that we've been bringing out over the last couple of years, on the precision side, whether it's ExactEmerge or ExactApply, which Brent mentioned earlier, or things like Combine Advisor. So I think the ability to focus and prioritize their will be a key kind of how we operate going forward.","Ryan Campbell","Hey, Rob. This is Ryan. We've made significant investments in the building blocks to be able to deliver incremental value to our customers through the use of technology and precision agriculture, and we will continue to do that. What I would say, we're early -- we're delivering measurable value today, but the opportunity, the more we work on it, the opportunity in our minds continues to grow. So we'll continue to have that be a priority for us. Now, at the same time, we're going to look at our global customers and work to find more efficient ways to deliver our products and services, so that we can satisfy their needs as well.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks, Rob. We'll go ahead and go to our next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Seth Weber","Hey, good morning everybody. Josh, last quarter you guys talked about potentially taking production down about 20% and some of the larger facilities, can you just kind of recalibrate us where you're at, kind of where third quarter was, and then what you're thinking for fourth quarter relative to third quarter? Thanks.","Josh Jepsen","Yes, maybe just to kind of clear out, I think, that was probably not as clear as it as it could have been. As we think about -- the back half of the year, that comment was back-half of the year versus back-half of 2018. So, continue to expect that we will produce less than we did in 2018 similar to what we commented a quarter ago. I think importantly, maybe for a little more clarity is as we think about large tractors, we will underproduce retail demand for large tractors in the North America by a mid single-digit. So, no significant change to where we were a quarter ago, but that continues to be our expectation.","All right. Thank you, Seth. We'll go ahead and go to our next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. I wonder if you could talk about how much of the cost improvement initiatives that you're looking for improving supply chain performance and on time deliveries and just update us if you wouldn't mind on how the expediting fees and costs shook out this quarter compared to what we had seen earlier this year?","Josh Jepsen","So, from a supply-based perspective we've definitely seen the challenges, the disruptions, delinquencies have come down significantly, we're in better and better shape there. So, operating more and more effectively and efficiently, I think you've seen as it relates to your premium freight. We talked about some acute issues we have seen on small tractors. As we have noted, we expect those to carry into the third quarter, which they did but they've abated and we don't -- do not expect to see those as we go forward. By and large the situation much improved. As you think about cost savings moving forward, I think the opportunities there are, as we move from getting parts in, which was a significant challenge as we ramped in '18 and certainly '19, really shift to how can we spend more time on structural material cost reduction, which we typically have over time.","Thanks, Jerry. We'll go ahead and go to our next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. I guess two questions. Just based on what you guys said about. I guess, comment on how you're feeling about channel inventory and specifically on the large ag side as we approach 2020 and whether we'll be in a position in 2020 to produce in line with retail demand, given the under production in the back half of the year. And then I guess my second question, just well, the numbers on construction are obviously good this quarter and it sounds like you have good visibility. But there are some concerns that there's excess inventory on the construction side too. So can you just talk about what you're seeing from your perspective? Thanks.","Josh Jepsen","Yes, I think the inventory overall, I think it's really a question. If you think about large ag in North America, we talked about I just mentioned, the mid single-digit underproduction for large tractors. I think what we expect is particularly in the U.S., what were the actions were taken will -- would allow us to produce to retail demand. Canada as noticed, there's a little more weakness there. So that's a spot that we need to work through further. So that would maybe a bit -- take a bit longer, but in the U.S., we would say we're positioned to do so, as if you think about where we're at from a field inventory perspective in construction.","As Brent mentioned, we still got on average, a couple months of order coverage, which is really aligned with where we traditionally run. So those replenishment times have had shorten. And that's -- we say that's a positive thing, which also helps in our ability to react to changing market dynamics. So we still intend to build field inventory during the year, as we've talked about coming off of historical loads. But that's the ability to be quicker on our replenishment allows us to be adjusting more quickly and as needed. So we'll continue to watch that market and make changes while we go forward.","So, thank you. We'll go ahead and jump to our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Fisher","Thanks. Good morning, guys. What if do you see as the biggest changes that are driving the $100 million net income guidance reduction? And then, I think your sales guidance suggests Q4 sales growth year-over-year both in ag and construction and can you talk about kind of what would be driving actual growth in the fourth quarter?","Brent Norwood","Yes, so we think about Ag in the fourth quarter, really the biggest, biggest impact there is in South America and Brazil in particular as we see some growth in that market particularly as we start to prepare for 1Q of spring season in Brazil and in 1Q. There is a little bit of a small tractor as well just from a year-over-year perspective where last year we were trying to build inventory and we had a stronger 3Q and a little bit weaker 4Q in 2019 is a little bit flatter, so those two areas and then there is a little bit of impact as you think about cash receipts improving and some MFP payments that we talked about where we could see some incremental demand, we don't think that's large but could be beneficial. On the C&F side, it's I would say it is more, we got the building inventory that we expected to see and plan for throughout the year that that drives the up from a fourth quarter perspective there.","Ryan Campbell","And this is Ryan, you're thinking about the guide down by $100 million. There's some volume in there in both divisions. There's also a little bit of incremental discount spend particularly as it relates to the Canada market. But what I would say about that is overall we're still expecting 3% price realizations, so those are really some of the moving pieces that took us from 3.3 to 3.2.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks, Steve. So we can then go to our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Yes, hi. You know that higher losses on your operating lease residuals in the quarter and also other assets on the balance sheet on that rose 33% year-over-year, suggesting the more used equipment is being returned onto your books. In meantime you're talking about 3% pricing on new equipment. So can you talk about whether new pricing is getting wiped out as farmers buy used equipment and not willing to pay for technology or even vice versa, they're willing to pay for technology on the used market. But that's just cannibalizing used values on equipment that doesn't have technology, I mean what's going on there and are we really talking about a 3% gross price if you've taken the losses on operating residuals into account?","Ryan Campbell","Yes, so I think I mean if you think about used values in particular for large Ag as we are seeing them be pretty stable and I think maybe importantly good condition late model year are actually fetching a premium and there continues to be a demand for technology, whether it's new as we mentioned on the EOPs we are seeing strong adoption. And I think what we're seeing and we're hearing this directly from customers is technology impact is most important as you're going through challenging conditions. So the willingness to invest in technology certainly is there and we're seeing the benefits as we deal with shorter windows execute jobs in the field and that's presence, I say both on new and used. So I think that there's not a lot of differentiation there between those two.","Ann Duignan","And as you think about your initial comment on the operating lease losses note in the quarter, so as you think about when we did lease returns that come back through John Deere Financial, market goes back to dealer channel. So certainly the uncertainty we're seeing from a customer perspective is impacting the environment right now. And we as we have in the past have decided to move some aged inventory in order to not carry that for another used season and as a result of that, we've seen some pressure on recovery rates and that's what was reflected here in the quarter?","I think as we go forward, we continue to be really mindful of what's coming due and how do we work with the customers and the dealers to best manage that. And maybe one thing worth noting there is as we look forward, we actually see less lease maturities in the forward-looking 12 months than we have in the most recent 12 months. So we'll continue managing that and be mindful of what we're doing there.","Josh Jepsen","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andy Casey","Thanks a lot. Good morning everybody. My question is really the pathway from where you seem to be guiding margins in 2019 somewhere in the low to mid 9% range to the goal to be at 15%, mid-cycle operating margins by 2022. The margins headwinds that you had through 2019 appear to be dissipating similar to the FX headwind called out for ag and turf. If you exclude those headwinds, could you help us with what 2019 margin would have looked like, I guess I'm just trying to understand that over the next couple years, should we expect pretty healthy margins snap back in 2020 absent those headwinds or is the gap closure to goal that 15% more weighted to 2021?","Brent Norwood","Yes, thanks Andy. Yes, you're right. I mean if you look at our ag and turf division for the year, the combination of FX and mix are a little more than a 1.5 of margin drag in 2019. So that is a significant component there. And then as we've talked about quite a bit of the material in the premium freight has been, has been a drag as well on margins.","I think as we look forward and as we've talked about in the past in the fourth quarter, we expect material to improve and be favorable. Similarly in response to Gary's question we don't expect to see that the high level of premium freight that we have for the first three months of the year. Those are all things that that we would expect to see improvement. And then add to Ryan's comments as we move forward, we're continuing to look to take actions to deliver improved margins.","So cost reduction is going to be a component of that not only in 2020 but as we go forward through 2022. The other things remain the same that we are accelerating and feel really good about is adoption of precision ag and what we can do from a differentiated value perspective for our customers. Our ability to grow our aftermarket parts and services business and the successful integration of Wirtgen all of those things are the recipe to get us from where we are today to the aspirational target to that 15% in 2022.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks Andy, we will go to our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashish Gupta with Stephens. Your line is open.","Ashish Gupta","Thanks. Good morning. Just a clarification on the order book in ag, I think last quarter it would be May, you talked about it being out this September which would be roughly four months and now you kind of seems like talking about 4Q mostly covered which would sort of imply roughly two months be consistent with sort of the uncertainty commentary. But I just wanted to kind of clarify if that's the right way to think about it?","Brent Norwood","So the mostly covered was in reference actually to construction forestry where we've got about two months on average there in the construction book. As you think about large tractors, that's where we're well into November. And if you look at both 8,000 or 9,000 Series tractors. So we've got further coverage there again albeit on a lower schedule but we've got, I think pretty similar visibility to what we did a quarter ago.","Josh Jepsen","Thank you. We'll go ahead and go to our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Joe O'Dea","Hi, good morning. Josh, how do you think about the divergent trends that you're seeing in the EOP so far and maybe it's early days but just kind of out of the gate what you're seeing in combines to try to understand what the underlying demand level is and indications heading into next year where it sounds like planters good trends but highly technology oriented and then in a sprayer seeing the drag there and just trying to understand how you guys are sort of parsing through that to think about the direction of demand?","Ryan Campbell","Yes, this is a great question, Joe. I mean I think as Brent mentioned EOP started in June. Historically when we started in June just because the planting season is over, so with that backdrop planting occurring well into June, where we think the first date may not be good as an indicator of what we expect in the year to come happy with the past because of the level of uncertainty there.","Sprayers really markets as Brent mentioned Canada down more significantly and that's impactful because of the high level of technology as well as machines you see in Canada that are typically ordered there, so that has been impactful, U.S. maybe one dynamic that's a little bit different for the U.S. even though we're down double-digits but you're a little bit better, Ag service providers you will make up nearly a third of the industry and they've been delayed perceptions obviously not doing really any spraying or much spraying at all in May and then limited amounts in June.","So anecdotally I think the conversations there said they've deferred and then delayed some of their CapEx decisions until we get a little bit deeper into the season. So I think that's been -- that's kind of played out over time. So we'll continue to see what very few looks like for those programs, but I think the positive news is customer's willingness to invest in technology where they can see value in positive outcomes.","And in addition to that, you look at what we saw on exact emerge growth in our take rates there, similar on exact supply. So continued progress, as it relates to combines still really early. We're two weeks in, so we'll continue to monitor that and provide some insight as we get to the fourth quarter. That program kicked-off in the first part of this month and runs through January. So we'll see how that that evolves as we go forward.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks Joe. We'll go ahead and go to our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Raso","Hi, thank you. I know you just went through a lot right there but I'm trying to understand with one quarter to go when you target year-end inventory in receivables, it's making a statement about the next year assume demand profile. Can you help us a bit with what kind of demand profile did you bake into your assumption for those year-end inventory targets?","Ryan Campbell","If you think of ag and turf in particular, I would say the two things that are really impact where we're ending and seeing what changed from our previous guide. I mean one is some weakness that we've seen in Canada that that's represented there and a little bit higher inventory receivables. And then the other piece would be Brazil. And as we look forward to the first quarter in that market and the expectations there given some of the factors Luke mentioned in terms of strong margins, really strong crops that we expect translates to see some positive end market changes there.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks David. We will go to our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Steven Volkmann","Hi, good morning guys. So my question is around pricing and the three points of prices is pretty impressive and I guess I'm just trying to figure out, I think you try not to capture mixed. So things like exact emerge and sort of the value there is not in the 3%, if I'm not mistaken and I'm just curious how you can push that much price and what the outlook might be as we sort of go out a little bit further?","Ryan Campbell","As it relates to price, you're right in your commentary that that is like for like and does not include features or things that would be he added on. So that's fair. So those kind of things would show up in mix and not in our price realization. So that's correct. Yes, if you think about price, I think you're kind of how and why are we able to get it. I think it's really been able to deliver value to the customers and understanding the economic inputs and outcomes that we're able to deliver and I think we had a number of customers talked about it, the ability with exact converts for example to plant 3000 acres in three days and the only three days of good weather they had. That's a really big advantage to be able to have that and execute that and that's a difference can be the difference being getting a crop at all versus not.","As you think about going forward, we've averaged over the last decade on our quick operations about two and a half points of price and as we look forward, I think we've been higher this year in the net average probably get closer to that average as we step forward.","Brent Norwood","Yes, what I would say I mean as we think about the total value of our production system with respect to the equipment and technology and the service and support that our dealer network can provide as we feel comfortable that there's some significant incremental value that we can continually add for our customers. And so that's how we think about pricing. Now as Josh said, when something new comes out it doesn't come into pricing but updates or year-over-year comparisons to things that have already been out. That does come into pricing but that overall total value that we can bring with the products, the technology and the service and support that our dealers can provide give us comfort that that our pricing is well within bounds and Josh indicated it is within our historical ranges.","Josh Jepsen","Thank you. We'll go to our next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Chad Dillard","Hi, good morning guys. So just wanted to circle back on the cost savings, so just want to get a sense for like what the control order of magnitude could be. How are you splitting that between each business Sprint business line and also just like the timeframe to enact and then hit the full run rate. And then secondly just a question on the low horsepower tractor you just want to get a sense for your comfort with the channel inventory and how you're thinking about production versus retail demand?","Ryan Campbell","Yes, this is Ryan. So, on the cost side, we're not ready to provide that level of detail. What I would say is we've taken targeted actions already in the third quarter, we've got some contemplated in the fourth quarter, the total of those are relatively small at this point, they would total about $25 million in cost. We're prepared to provide an update with our fourth quarter earnings call as we give our 2020 outlook on what those might mean to 2020 and going forward. What I'd just say it's an acknowledgement that cost reduction is going to be just a larger component of our path from today's margins to the 15% aspirational margins that we haven't missed cycle in 2022.","Brent Norwood","And maybe just follow-on relative to contractor, I think broadly I think we feel comfortable with where we're at from an inventory level and we're pretty much aligned in line with where the industry is and we'll continue to be strong end market demand there really driven by general economic conditions in the U.S. in particular. So thank you.","Josh Jepsen","We will go ahead and go to our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is open.","Mig Dobre","Yes, thank you. Good morning and just to follow-up on that can you help me understand if the cost actions that you're talking about are sort of driven by the changes in the end markets expected production volumes et cetera or this is more structural in nature longer term planned and maybe the second part of my question is on Wirtgen, I love an update there and maybe your view on margin here because it seems to me like your outlook for margins has ticked down. And I'm wondering how we should be thinking about this business go forward? Thanks.","Brent Norwood","Thanks Mig, I will start on Burkett. Yes, so I mean if you think about Burkett overall, really strong third quarter which we expect that we talked about that. So essentially about 60% margins in if you kind of take out purchase accounting last year, that's actually similar margins on a slightly lower sales level. So we feel good about the way that business is performed. Margins did come in some for the full-year really driven by changes in mix, in their business as you have seen some shifts as well as under production on a couple of their brands as we align order fulfillment strategies as part of our integration.","So as we are going to under produce and are under producing to some extent this year that is impacting their margins but we think that's the right thing to do to position ourselves forward for going forward there. So I mean in summary on Wirtgen, strong margin performance in the quarter, continue to feel really good about that business, confidence in \u20ac125 million of synergies and we continue marching down that path and provide updates as we go.","Ryan Campbell","Yes, on the cost reduction side, the plans are really focused on longer-term structural changes in our cost structure as opposed to lever pulling given where we are in the cycle but more to come in fourth quarter earnings call for that.","Josh Jepsen","Thank you, Mig. I will go to our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Courtney Yakavonis","Hi, good morning guys. Just a quick clarification on the $25 million that you talked about being out of the third and fourth quarter, is that a run rate and is that currently embedded in the $100 million guidance reduction. And then secondly, when you talked about early orders, you talked about them being flat in units up because of precision Ag. Can you give us any more granularity on whether the uptick of things like ExactEmerge are continuing to see a step function higher or is it roughly at the same 35% level and just grinding incrementally higher? Thanks.","Ryan Campbell","Yes, on the EOP side we saw that move from kind of that a third of planters going with ExactEmerge up to around 40% and that's just the exact numbers but we're also seeing just larger planters, so I think about with bigger planters and more highly featured both of those things are contributing to that that value being up as Brent noted. ","Brent Norwood","On the cost side, those are one-time costs. I wouldn't conclude that that's the run rate. And it is embedded in the $100 million reduction in guidance that we have.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks Courtney. We'll go ahead and go to our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry De Maria with William Blair. Your line is open.","Larry De Maria","Hey, good morning. Thank you. Just curious, did your outlook contemplate the USDA report just came out and did that change your thinking at all since it came out, because it sounds like you still expect farmers to use some of their MFP cash to buy equipment in your fiscal fourth quarter? So I'm guessing not. So maybe it plays out over time? And secondly, where do you guys stand on planted acreage and yield now? I don\u2019t know if you differ from where expectations are? Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","Yes, so maybe I'll start with the fundamental part of the question with regard to planted acreage and yield. And obviously, what the USDA released on Monday, surprised the market, particularly on the corn, I'd say more harvested areas than planted, and certainly the yield. So the limit down moving in corn price has caught a lot of people by surprise. So that's kind of what we have at the moment to work with, I guess what we would say is that, there's still a long way to go in this growing season.","Obviously, we've had a lot of abnormal weather. With the delay planning, there is a lot of variability in crop progress from the western side of the corn belt, where it's looking a lot better across to the eastern side, where there's a lot more variability. Obviously, the light of planning, development opens up windows for early crops and those sorts of things. So -- and certainly history shows us that final yield numbers can vary relatively significantly from these August estimates, so the methodology that the USDA uses changes as we go through the crop season. And as we get into harvest and get some actual harvest data, we might see that changing as we go forward. So we'll be obviously watching that closely. And that'll be important in terms of what it means to final production. And that's crucial ending stocks number.","Ryan Campbell","And I think, Larry, what do you think about kind of the MFP impact? Certainly very, I mean, farmer-to-farmer, you get very different situations in terms of the size and health of their crops, whether or not they market a grain in May, June, as prices ran out. So there's a lot of dynamics, I think that'll impact, if and when they use some of that from a cash receipt perspective.","Luke Chandler","Yes, I guess just to add on to that Josh, like that the MFP has really been a shot in the arm for U.S. farmers, when you think about the cash receipts, it provides the boost for 2019 so it listed to its highest levels in 2014. And it certainly helps, given some of the issues that we've got with trade uncertainties and the impact that we've seen this week on commodity prices. So some of them will have been able to benefit from marketing old crop docks as what were some of the highest prices, we had in five years earlier in the year, they've been able to market forward at higher prices as well. And obviously, we'll wait to see what it means for equipment demand given the uncertain conditions we have.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks, Larry. We'll go to our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Raso","Hi, thank you. A few addresses that I apologize if I missed it. Your implied construction equipment margins for the fourth quarter. I mean, on a year-over-year basis, it looks like a pretty solid decline, despite sales are up. And if I missed something that explains why the margin performance would all of a sudden roll like that. My apologies but can you explain why that\u2019s the case?","Josh Jepsen","Yes, you're saying in the fourth quarter?","David Raso","Yes, the margin guidance for the full-year is 11%, I believe correct. So that implies, 9.6 or something of that nature for the fourth quarter and that that'd be down year-over-year, despite sales up 6%. And just given us -- having a pretty strong run of margins, I wasn't sure, if something was changing on incentives for dealers or mix or something I'm missing?","Ryan Campbell","Yes, David. It's Ryan. I think mix is a component of that. The other aspect of that is construction as a different material, commodity footprint. And so overall benefits that we're projecting to see in that -- in the fourth quarter on material costs, part of that is positive in ag, construction is still not yet seeing that benefit. The other thing is pricing -- our pricing comparison gets a little bit tougher. There are some actions that we took in the fourth quarter of last year that improved our pricing. So the compare -- the comparison gets a little bit tougher in the fourth quarter for construction, those are really the puts and takes associated with the margin performance that we're projecting for the fourth quarter in construction.","David Raso","Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks David. Okay, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Yes. Hi, thank you for taking the follow-up. I'm just wondering if we can expand conceptually on the cost reduction opportunity and the buckets of savings because as we look at the manufacturing footprint that you folks have pretty streamlined already a big tooling upgrade on the Tier 4 transition as well. So can you just help us understand the major buckets of opportunities as we are talking about improving the cost structure further from here in a bit more context? If you don't mind obviously, we'll get more detailed numbers next quarter as you mentioned, but any qualitative comments would be helpful?","Josh Jepsen","Yes, so I think, Ryan kind of laid out kind of the three areas in terms of kind of organizational efficiency. I think the second one is you think about footprint. I think there, we are single source for a lot of our products on a global basis. So we feel good about our capacity, so we start to look at how do we make sure we're focused and prioritize on those things that add most value for our customers and then those are going to be the two most important areas.","Ryan Campbell","Yes, Jerry. So we're not ready to breakout those buckets. Although, it\u2019s is all three that we're going to focus on and fourth quarter will provide an update on where we are, what it means to 2020 and kind of our view towards margin improvement all the way up to 2022 to hit our aspirational targets.","Josh Jepsen","So thank you, Jerry. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate it. We will be around, so please reach out, if you got questions. And have a good weekend. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

","Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tony Huegel, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Tony Huegel","Thank you. Also on the call today are Raj Kalathur, our Chief Financial Officer; and Susan Karlix, our Manager of Investor Communications.","Today we\u2019ll take a closer look at Deere\u2019s second quarter earnings, then spend some time talking about our markets and our outlook for the second half of fiscal 2014. After that we\u2019ll respond to your questions. ","Please note that slides are available to complement the call this morning. They can be accessed on our website at www.johndeere.com.","First, a reminder. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet and recorded for future transmission and use by Deere and NASDAQ OMX. Any other use, recording or transmission of any portion of this copyrighted broadcast without the express written consent of Deere is strictly prohibited. Participants in the call, including the Q&A session, agree that their likeness and remarks in all media may be stored and used as part of the earnings call.","This call includes forward-looking comments concerning the company\u2019s plans and projections for the future and are subject to important risks and uncertainties. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in the company\u2019s most recent Form 8-K and periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This call also may include financial measures that are not in conformance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America or GAAP. Additional information concerning these measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures is included in the release and posted on our website at www.johndeere.com\/financialreports under Other Financial Information. Susan.","Susan Karlix","Thank you Tony. Today John Deere announced earnings for the second quarter of 2014 and it was another solid performance. In reporting income of almost $1 billion, the company again demonstrated a depth execution of its operating plans, keeping costs and assets under control, while successfully managing major new product transactions. ","In addition, Ag and turf profits were somewhat lower. However, construction and forestry and financial services operations had significantly improved results. In our view this reflects the power of our broad based business lineup and it is one of the reasons we are continuing to call for full year income of $3.3 billion. ","Now lets take a closer look at the second quarter in detail, beginning on slide three. Net sales and revenues were down 9% to $9.9 billion. Net income attributable to Deere and Company was $981 million. EPS was $2.65 in the quarter, that\u2019s the second highest earnings per share in the company history. ","On slide four, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 10% to $9.2 billion. In the quarter-over-quarter comparison of net sales, Landscapes accounts for three points of the change. Also included is an unfavorable impact from currency translations of one point. Price realization in the quarter was positive by two points. ","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, lets start with Agriculture & Turf on slide five. Sales were down 12%, primarily due to lower shipment volumes, as well as a three point landscapes impact noted on the previous slide. Operating profit was $1.2 billion. ","Before we review the industry sales outlook, lets look at fundamentals affecting the Ag businesses. Slide six outlines U.S. Farm Cash Receipts, which are forecast to be down somewhat from 2013. Assuming trend yields, grain production levels are expected to be up in 2014, which would result in lower feed grain prices. Livestock receipts are forecasted to remain at record levels. As a result, our forecasts calls for 2014 cash receipts to be about $393 billion, down only 3% from 2013, which was the second highest level ever recorded.","On slide seven, global grain stocks to use ratios remain at sensitive levels, even after abundant harvest in 2013. The southern hemisphere, notability Brazil and Argentina is just now concluding the large harvest of both corn and soybeans. Planting is well underway in North American where farmers appear to be shifting some acreage from corn to soybeans in response to relative prices. But even though supplies appear to be adequate, global grain and oil seed demands remain strong. Unfavorable growing conditions in any part of the world would hurt production, reduce the stock to use ratio and result in prices quickly moving higher.","Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on slide eight. There are signs of economic stabilizations and cyclical recovery, with a modest forecast increase in GDP growth and rising business and consumer confidence. With feed costs easing strong beef prices and near record milk prices, margins remain supportive for livestock and dairy farmers. ","While remaining near long term averages, grain prices and farm income are expected to decrease in 2014. As a result, farm machinery demand is expected to be lower for the year. However, a differentiated picture continues to exist by country. While we see demand improving in the U.K. and Spain, some decline in important markets like France, German and Poland bears watching.","On slide nine you\u2019ll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In the CIS, slowing economic growth and product availability continues to weigh on equipment sales, while import polices are negatively impacting combine sales in Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. As geo political tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue, fewer acres are being planted and less inputs such as fertilizers and insecticides are being used, putting the 2014 crop at risk.","Slide 10 illustrates the value of agriculture production, a good prospect of the health of agro business in Brazil. The 2014 value of agriculture production is expected to increase about 5% over the 2013 levels. Brazil Soybeans product is expected to increase again this year, with yields of historically high prices and margins. On the other hand, while partially offset by the weak real, lower global commodity prices could reduce farm income.","Our 2014 Ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on slide 11. In the U.S. and Canada we continue to expect an Ag industry decline of 5% to 10%. The EU 28 industry outlook remain down about 5% due to lower crop prices and farm income. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down about 10% from 2013\u2019s strong levels.","South America continues to grow in importance for Deere. In April we introduced over 60 new products in the region, including 5E Series tractors with cab, self-propelled sprayers for sugarcane, planters and a new complete lineup on combine. ","Shifting to the CIS, we now expect industry sales to be down significantly, while in Asia, sales are projected to be up slightly. ","Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are now projected to be flat to up 5% in 2014. This slight change in our outlook is mainly due to the impact the harsh winter had on sales in the first half of the year. ","Putting this all together on slide 12, fiscal year 2014 Deere sales of worldwide Ag and turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 7%. In the year-over-year comparison of net sales, landscape accounts for about three points of the change and negative currency translation accounts for about one point. The one point reduction in our forecast from last quarter mainly reflects lower industry outlooks for Ag sales outside the U.S. and Canada and for the turf business. ","2014 operating margin for the Ag and turf division is forecast at about 14%. The two point decline in operating margin from 2013 is a result of volume, mix, foreign exchange and higher production costs, including implementation costs related to final tier 4. We have talked for some time about how a favorable mix associated with strength in the large Ag sector has been benefiting margins by one to two points. This year the mix benefit is forecast to be about one point. The mix benefit in 2013 was two points. ","Let\u2019s focus now on construction and forestry, on slide 13. Net sales were up 2% in the quarter and operating profit was up 63%. The divisions and incremental margin of 196% is a result of C&F\u2019s diligent focus on cost and the law of small numbers. ","Moving to slide 14, looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, you\u2019ll note that although the fundamentals are all lower than three months ago, the economy is slowly moving forward and there are positive signs in the market. Unemployment is falling and construction hiring is increasing. ","Housing starts are slowing ramping up, home inventories are low and prices are improving. Landscaping activity is picking up and financing for land developers is slowly recovering. Additionally, we continue to see a strong domestic energy sector. ","Deere\u2019s construction and forestry sales are forecast to be up about 10% for the year, which is unchanged from a quarter ago. The increase reflects higher shipments following the low levels of 2013, as well as industry growth in response to an improving U.S. economy and increased international sales.","Global forestry markets are now expected to be up about 10% in 2014. Following double-digit growth in 2013, North American forestry markets are expected up about 10%, while Europe and Russia are expected to improve from the depressed levels of 2013. C&F\u2019s full year operating margin is projected to be about 9%.","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operations. Slide 15 shows the financial services provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average owned portfolio at 30 April with five basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. Our 2014 financial forecast contemplates a loss provision of about 12 basis points. Losses remain well below the 10-year average of about 28 basis points, and the 15-year average of 48 basis points.","Moving to slide 16, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $148 million in the second quarter versus $125 million last year. 2014 net income attributable to Deere & Company is forecast to be about $600 million, which is unchanged from a quarter ago.","Slide 17 outlines receivables and inventory. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $603 million. That was equal to 32.1% of prior 12-month sales, down from 33% a year ago. Ag and turf ending receivables and inventory were down $554 million. Most of the decrease was accounted for by John Deere Landscapes and John Deere Water. ","Construction and forestry ended the quarter down $49 million, driven by lower Canadian consigned inventories. We expect to end 2014 with receivables and inventory down about $175 million.","Our 2014 guidance for cost of sales as a percentage of net sales shown on slide 18 is about 75%. When modeling 2014, keep in mind the following: price, about two points; lower pension OPEB expense; less favorable mix of product, overhead spend due to tier 4 transaction, tier 4 product cost and foreign exchange. ","Looking at R&D expense on slide 19, R&D was down about 6% in the second quarter, mainly due to timing of projects. Our 2014 forecast calls for R&D expense to be down about 1% compared to last year.","Moving now to slide 20, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down about 14% in the second quarter and is forecast to be down about 7% for the year. In the year-over-year comparison of SA&G expenses, Landscapes accounts for about seven points of the change and water about one point.","On slide 21, pension and OPEB expense was down about $40 million in the quarter and is forecast to be down about $150 million for the full year. ","Turning to slide 22, the equipment operations tax rate was approximately 32% in the second quarter. One of the discreet items benefiting the tax rate in the quarter related to John Deere Water as noted in our financial statements. For full year 2014, the effective tax rate is now forecast to be in the range of 33% to 35%.","On slide 23 you see our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Our forecast for cash flow from equipment operations is approximately $4 billion in 2014. Slide 24 highlights share repurchase activity since 2004. Of note is our strong share repurchase activity year-to-date, which has exhausted our 2008 repurchase authorization. Repurchases are now taking place under the $8 billion authorization announced in December. ","On slide 25 and 26 we outlined our 2014 outlook for the third quarter and full year. Our net sales forecast for the third quarter is down about 4% compared with 2013. This includes about two points of price realization. In the year-over-year comparison of third quarter sales, Landscapes accounts for about four points of the change.","The full year forecast calls for net sales to be down about 4%. In the year-over-year comparison of net sales, Landscapes accounts for about three points of the change. Price realization is expected to be positive by about two points; FX is expected to be negative by about one point. Finally our full year 2014 net income forecast remains at about $3.3 billion. ","In closing, John Deere expects to achieve near record earnings for the full year and the company is well positioned to deliver solid financial results throughout the business cycle. We are confident our investments in new products and markets, coupled with a tight reign on costs and assets will keep our growth plans moving ahead. ","As for our plan, we believe they are essential to helping meet the world\u2019s growing need for food, shelter and infrastructure and we continue to believe John Deere is exceptionally well positioned to benefit from these developments in the quarters and years to come. Tony. ","Tony Huegel ","Now we\u2019re ready to being the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. But as a reminder, in consideration of others, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow up. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. ","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Hi, good morning. I guess two questions; first, Tony or Susan if you could just provide some color on how the order book has trended relative to last quarter with some of the new tier 4 final products introduced. Whether you\u2019ve seen any drop off in how you\u2019re thinking about visibility for the second half of the year. ","And then I guess my second question just relates to the implied decremental margins in the back half of the year in Ag. It seems like they should be worse in the back half given your top-line assumptions. I thought the second quarter probably would have been the worse with production down more. If you can just walk me here if there\u2019s anything I\u2019m missing there? Thanks.","Tony Huegel","Sure, yes and first of all of the order book, I think maybe as an overarching comment on large Ag in particular, what we would tell you is if you think about the retail order coverage that we have on our forecast, we would tell you compared to last year we would be roughly inline. It\u2019s slightly below where we were a year ago, but again, roughly in line with the order coverage we have on the forecast. So again, I think trending pretty well there. ","Specifically related to final tier 4, we talked about this last quarter as well with specifically the 8R tractor, where we were seeing very strong orders for that final tier four tractor. Didn\u2019t really see any kind of drop-off at that time. ","Our order book, we often talk about where we\u2019re at from an availability perspective and we would tell you on 8R\u2019s our order availability is into October. There is some availability remaining on that product for the year, but well into October in terms of that availability. So again, pretty good story from that perspective. ","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Any color on combines Tony. ","Tony Huegel","Well again, it wouldn\u2019t have changed much from our second quarter. You know our early order program tends to pretty much fill out that program and we saw that order fill pretty much the way we had anticipated and again have, we feel pretty good in terms of the order coverage obviously to the forecast cast we have in place today. ","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Sorry, then the second question on the implied detrimentals in the back half.","Tony Huegel","On the detrimentals when you keep in mind that as you look historically at our cost of sales, second quarter tends to be the best; the lowest cost of sales as a percent of net sales of any, and that will true this year. But if you look at the differential in what\u2019s implied in the outlook, you will note that second quarter relative to the comments that you mentioned with the transitions we had, second quarter isn\u2019t as strong as what you would normally see, but it still is forecast to be our best quarter from a lower cost of sales as a percent of net sales kind of ratio. So I guess that I would argue that you are seeing in the forecast in terms of the differential not being as broad as what you would normally see. ","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue. ","Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller. ","Operator","Your next question is from Seth Weber, RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Hey, good morning everybody. ","Tony Huegel","Hey Seth. How are you?","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","How are you? Good thanks. Two questions, so just your level of confidence in the construction and forestry up 10% for the year. I mean that suggests a pretty powerful ramp here in the second half, something like the high teens growth rate for each of the third and fourth quarters. Can you just maybe give us a little bit more color there on how of that is dealer restocking and how much of is some of the new production you are adding and then I have a follow-up question.","Tony Huegel","Sure, yes. And we would tell you again, that outlook as you mentioned hasn\u2019t changed. Its always, and we talked about this throughout the year, it always has recognized more strength in the back half. ","Remember, to be fair, the comps do get a bit easier in the back half of the year, year-over-year, but if you look, our order book is up strong. We tell you that the order book is up double digits. We feel pretty good about that. ","As it breaks down though, when you think about where are those higher sales coming from, we would tell you about three-fourth of the sales are coming from our U.S. and Canada market and about a quarter of the sales increase will come from outside the U.S. and Canada. ","We didn\u2019t break out how much is inventory versus retail, but again as you talked about before, certainly the inventory build is a fair amount of that increase for U.S. and Canada as we ended last year with very low inventory levels versus being what the market was last year. So our dealers are building inventory in anticipation or expected to build inventory, both in anticipation of the higher retail, as well as we would argue kind of right sizing from a pretty strong pull down last year.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thank you and then just to follow up on Brazil, the change in outlook for the South American market, that tempered a little bit. I mean is that still around the tsunami dislocation or is there something that you feel like has actually softened in the overall market.","Tony Huegel","Yes, first I want to make sure we\u2019re clear. That\u2019s tractors and combines only, so it wasn\u2019t applied to the remaining part of our business, which is a significant part of our sales in South America. It\u2019s primarily driven by a little bit of softening in a couple of markets, really around tractor. So if you think about Argentina, some challenges with import tariff and that\u2019s primarily impacting tractors, at least for Deere and then also the sugarcane industry had little bit weaker markets in Brazil, a little weaker margins and we would anticipate sales to be a bit lower than what was previously expected on tractors and to that industry as well.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.","Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","And your next question comes from Steven Fisher, UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS","Hi, good morning. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about the cost actions that you took in the quarter, where were they focused, how quickly can they kind of give you some pay back and how much more runway do you have on cost actions from here, should things deteriorate a little bit further?","Tony Huegel","I mean, I think as we talked about and as we anticipate and see the markets changing with our FDA structure, we do have what we refer to as lever studies and expectations of what we can pull. I think part of what your seeing and in the quarter actually as it relates to C&S for example, we pulled a number of levers last year at the division and its been slow to release those levers until we see those very strong sales that we\u2019re anticipating coming through. ","They\u2019ve kept some of those pulled to the extent they can and I think really as you move forward in the upcoming years, it depends on what the market provides, there are a number of things we can do. You saw quite a bit of discipline around R&D and SA&G in the quarter for example. Some of that to be fair is timing of projects. SA&G for example tends to be a little higher in the back half of the year for a number of reasons, but those would be the things we would think about certainly in terms of levers that we could pull if necessary to keep our margins as strong as possible.","Raj Kalathur","Steve, this is Raj. As you know, the process we have is byproduct. Almost every unit is looking at where they are on the line. You talk about in the 8120 or depending on the product it might vary that line and they need to provide us expected return at different points in the line, okay different returns. ","So each one of them is working automatically on whether its cost of sales items or SA&G items okay, how they can get to walk down the line if they are coming down or walk up the line. So you have hundreds of things going on in the company depending on where that particular product line is, they may take a different action at another product line.","So you are seeing us walking down the line and that\u2019s the benefit you see. If some portions of large Ag are coming down and you can expect them to walk down the lines there. If our small Ag is going up to North America, they\u2019ll walk up the line.","Steven Fisher - UBS","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then just a question on the small equivalent side in Ag. It seems to be holding up better than the larger side. Can you just talk about sort of the visibility you have there and if there\u2019s pent up demand that\u2019s coming through now and what sort of a feed outlook looking maybe a little flatter, what kind of visibility you have there on the small equivalent side.","Tony Huegel","Yes, on small Ag versus large, I mean this is a broad statement and our order book would not be as far out and rarely would be versus the large. So you don\u2019t have quite as much visibility, but certainly as expected we\u2019re seeing strength in that market. ","Livestock margins continue to remain very strong and are expected to really through the year and most are expecting it to continue to be strong, even in the next year and that\u2019s a market that\u2019s had some struggle in the recent years. So pent-up demand is hard to measure, but you can argue that a market or a part of our business that has had lower sales in recent years and has the opportunity to just from a cycle perspective to improve that as we move forward and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re seeing today.","Steven Fisher - UBS","Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Thank you. Our next caller.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Casey, Wells Fargo.","Andrew Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks. Good morning everyone. ","Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Andrew Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks Tony. Was there any specific region that is driving the $50 million decrease in the trade receivable and inventory outlook for 2014?","Tony Huegel","I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any specific region that we would point to, that would be driving that reduction. We tend to look at it from an enterprise perspective, so I don\u2019t have a great answer for you on that Andy.","Andrew Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, thanks. And then I guess a follow-up on that is\u2026","Tony Huegel","You\u2019re talking on C&F on the quarter?","Andrew Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","Yes.","Tony Huegel","Actually I would argue, some of that is going to be Canada. If you look at it at a region, we talked a lot last year, a bit last year about consigned inventory in Canada. Well, its was a bit high and that came down nicely and year-over-year is actually down very nicely. I was thinking for the year, but certainly at this point in time it\u2019s I would argue, Canada.","Andrew Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","I\u2019m sorry Tony, I didn\u2019t ask the question right. The $50 million reduction in the Ag and turf segment for the year, down 275 versus prior\u2026","Tony Huegel","Oh, between Ag and turf, no. I think again that your really looking at kind of minor adjustments here and there. I would argue that it\u2019s a relatively \u2013 given that versus the total receivables in inventory, that\u2019s a minor adjustment.","Andrew Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, and is that all behind you with Q2 or does some of that remain ahead.","Tony Huegel","Well, keep in mind, much of where we\u2019re at Q2, so I would say its still ahead, because if you look at Q2, much of that is really driven by lower receivables and inventory as it relates to landscapes and water. If you took those out your relatively flat year-over-year and so when you get to the end of the year we\u2019ll have further pull out.","Andrew Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, I\u2019ll follow-up. Thanks.","Tony Huegel","And I add that and I do want to point out for others as well. Keep in mind that as you look at the end of Q2 versus the year end, there is a difference in terms of year-over-year compare. So last year at the end of Q2 under landscape inventory and receivable would have been in our reported numbers. They were not in our year end numbers, so that\u2019s why when you look at the Q2 reduction, its much greater than what we\u2019re anticipating for the end of the year, but if you pull out the impact of landscapes you\u2019ll see a greater reduction actually at the end of the year versus where we\u2019re at currently.","Next caller.","Operator","Your next question is from Adam Uhlman, Cleveland Research. ","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Yes, hi guys. Good morning.","Tony Huegel","Hello.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","I guess first of all on construction and forestry, if you could start by addressing the price realization you got in that business and also talk about how the tier 4 final price increases are coming through?","Tony Huegel","Yes, specific to construction and forestry, we don\u2019t talk about price realization by division. So we did talk about two points of price realization for the year on an enterprise basis and what we would tell you is in our current forecast we would anticipate both divisions participating in a positive way on price realization and so again, that\u2019s about all we really talk to from a price perspective. If you think about our final tier 4, we do have some constrains. I don\u2019t know if that was a broad comment or if that was specific to construction and forestry.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Maybe if you could just address both.","Tony Huegel","Yes, so if you think about that broadly, final tier 4, while we do have some construction products transitioning in 2014 and its more or less a large Ag transition year more than construction and in that regard from a cost perspective, we would tell you that we would anticipate recovering all of the cost on large Ag in the year. ","We are still recovering some of the interim tier 4 costs actually on construction and forestry, so we can tell you by the end of the year our forecast would estimate roughly 90% recovered on interim tier 4 and remember, construction, because of the size of the product, the horsepower range of the product tended to be about a year behind in the transition from what Ag was, so we\u2019re making good progress, kind of on plan.","Raj Kalathur","So Adam, this is Raj. On the topic of price utilization, with regards to C&S, we did say in our press release about higher sales discounts and here\u2019s a competitive environment we are facing and we have built our share over a long period of time based on providing better products, better services and better business processes. So you should expect us to defend our share while delivering healthy margins.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Okay, got you. So with the kind of positive price this quarter, but that\u2019s the goal for the year.","Tony Huegel","Well, I mean I think if you ask specifically about the quarter, that would be true, but keep in mind, as you think about price realization and the mention of sales incentives in the press release with accrual accounting as the assumptions change in terms of your anticipation on what are these sales incentives or any other types of accruals like that, keep in mind, the accrual change is not just for current sales, but also for the population that\u2019s in the field already that you recorded sales in the past. ","So you do get a larger than expected increase in that particular quarter. And again, I think its more important really to look at it from an annual perspective as it relates to that and again, that would be a positive price realization for the year.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Okay, thank you.","Tony Huegel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jerry Revich, Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. This is Matthew Rybak on behalf of Jerry. First, I was wondering if you could talk about the impact of tier 4 conditions on factory costs in the quarter and then possibly update us on the timing of major product line transitioning costs in the coming quarters.","Tony Huegel","Yes, I mean we don\u2019t talk about specific cost levels. The cost pieces as you may recall beginning in 2013, we changed our guidance and we talk about the total cost of sales as percent of net sales and at that time we discontinued the individual pieces of the dollar amount. But certainly it was a factor and as you look at the cost of sales for the quarter. But I would tell you if you look at things like mix and FX, those were also very significant impacts in the costs. ","As you go forward through the year there would be some, but the majority of those transitions would be behind us, at least as it relates to large Ag and again we have some significant transitions coming up for next year, 2015 as we transition small Ag, as well as a pretty large number of construction and forestry products.","Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs","Perfect. And then can you talk a little bit about the drivers of your CapEx reduction guidance this year and maybe where your cutting investment and talk about your longer term CapEx plans compared to significant new facility investments you\u2019ve made over the past couple of years.","Tony Huegel","Yes, I would tell you that that CapEx reduction is really just minor adjustments and as we get closer to the end of the year, really examining what we would expect to complete this year. As you might imagine, many of those projects are multi year projects, so what\u2019s going to get done this year versus next, those sort of thing. So I would not read much into that adjustment that we made there. ","And then you know we talked about from the longer-term perspective. At least in the short to mid term that $1.1 million to $1.3 million range is what you should anticipate as you report and that\u2019s not just new facilities. Remember we had with final tier 4, that\u2019s driving a significant portion of the CapEx requirement as well and lead through 2015. We certainly have a fair number of products that continue to transition.","Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you very much.","Tony Huegel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Vishal Shah, Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank","Yes hi, thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m just wondering if you can provide some more details around your C&S guidance of 10% growth this year. How much of it is coming from market growth versus inventory rebuild and whether the growth is coming from domestic and international markets and also, just any update on your thoughts on expectations for bonus appreciation as well as timing of 179 incentives. Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Sure. Yes and I mentioned earlier on the call, really if you think about that 10% net sales increase for Deere\u2019s construction and forestry business, about three quarters of that is coming from U.S. and Canada, both as you mentioned inventory, some inventory restocking as well as the stronger retail environment. About a quarter of those sales come from outside the U.S. and Canada. So those are things like our businesses in Brazil, those new facilities and factories come on line and we talked about strengthening forestry demand in the European market as an example. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving that business. ","If you think about the U.S. past incentives, there\u2019s been a number of activities in converse around that, kind of moving those potential extensions forward. What we will tell you, at least what we have in our modeling. So what we\u2019re anticipating in our Ag modeling is that they would both be extended, but the extension wouldn\u2019t be past until late calendar 2014 and so for Deere in terms of our 2014 benefit to our sales, it would be limited to nothing. Obviously we would have some benefit early in the year, so that would be our expectation.","Again, what we\u2019re modeling is the section 179 gets extended at about half the level. Not that we have any particular intelligence that would tell you that that\u2019s where it is, but effectively we\u2019re splitting the difference, whether it would be at the 500,000 or not get extended at all and that\u2019s the rational for why we use that number in our modeling. But again, that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the model line.","Susan Karlix","And I think the thing to keep in mind is we\u2019re saying late calendar 2014 gross profit is now impacted until 2015.","Tony Huegel","Right.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Okay. Next caller.","Operator","Your next question is from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan","Hi, good morning guys.","Tony Huegel","Hi.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan","I want to go back to Jamie\u2019s question, just get the question answered more clearly. If you look at during combine order books for North America this year, where did it come in relative to last year, just the year-over-year change, not versus your forecast.","Tony Huegel","Well, we haven\u2019t talked to it. I mean we talked about large Ag being down double digits and certainly that would include our combine order book, so pretty much as expected, but certainly down double-digits. ","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan","And combine\u2019s been a little bit more than the average?","Tony Huegel","Let me look at it here, just a second Ann. If you look at combines relative to, its kind of with other large Ag products. As we look at what our industry retail sales estimates are, which obviously would be a fair chunk of that, I would tell you that they are not down more than the rest of the industry, more than the other large Ag products. I would say its pretty much right on average.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan","Okay, another large product here including things like sprayers and\u2026","Tony Huegel","Your talking sprayers, planters, well obviously our row crop tractors, four wheel drive tractors those sorts of products. Think about the product that a typical row crop framer would use. ","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan","Yes. Okay, and then going forward, how should we think about your financial services business in terms of the revenue come in, but larger forecasting. We shouldn\u2019t have been surprised I suspect, but we tend to finance more again as the large crop farmer in the U.S. Can you just give us a context of how we should think about that business going forward if the large row crop framer remains under pressure?","Tony Huegel","Yes, I mean I think as you think about market share if you will for John Deere financial, as it relates to our Ag business in the U.S. and Canada, that would be our strongest market share business and its running right around 60% of the Ag sales, would be financed with John Deere financial and as you\u2019re aware our biggest competitor there is Cash, which takes up the bulk of the remainder. ","But as you move forward, to your point, while we\u2019re anticipating the portfolio to increase during 2014, its because that you have \u2013 we\u2019re still even though year-over-year, say over down, they are still anticipating more acceptances this year versus those that would be maturing or being paid off. ","If you continue to see pressure and our sales would flatten or maybe decrease, then obviously over a period of time you would see some lower portfolio and revenues. At least as it relates to U.S., Ag could potentially decrease, but you\u2019d have to make assumptions on what rest of the world and our penetration is and how that changes in the rest of the world as well. So there\u2019s obviously a lot of moving pieces there.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan","Okay, and just quickly as a follow-up to the section 179 question earlier, what are your thoughts on the mid term elections and the outcome of the mid term elections, upside potential to your 179 or downside. Do you have any thoughts on that?","Tony Huegel","We really don\u2019t, we don\u2019t. Again, the assumption is that after those mid term election, again late calendar years, it\u2019s likely to be extended, so\u2026","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan","Okay, thank you.","Tony Huegel","Again, at least that\u2019s what we have in our base case, so\u2026okay, thank you. ","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan","Yes, thanks.","Tony Huegel","Next caller.","Operator","The next question is from Mircea Dobre, Robert Baird.","Mircea Dobre - Robert Baird","Good morning guys.","Tony Huegel","Hey Mirc.","Mircea Dobre - Robert Baird","I guess, I\u2019d like to go back to construction and forestry for a second. I\u2019m a little bit confused about a top line guidance, because if I look at the last couple of quarters, you had very good orders. You talked about very good orders here and seasonally at least it would make sense to me that the second quarter would be when we see a lot of dealer inventory restocking. ","Yet, we\u2019ve seen readily tepid growth from a top line perspective over the last couple of quarters and your pointing out to much higher growth in the back half. Yet the economic indicators you\u2019re using in your forecast, all seem to have been adjusted lower. So can we sort of bridge the gap here? What sort of confidence do you have in your forecast at this point and what gives you that confidence I guess.","Tony Huegel","Yes, I think again I\u2019ll mention a couple of things. First of all I\u2019ll point out that while those economic indicators have lowered again, and those are people from outside sources of course, but given that they are still pointing upward and then pointing towards some improved overall market conditions. ","The other thing I would point out. As it relates specifically to that dealer restocking, keep in mind that one of the difference for Deere versus at least many of our competitors is our order fulfillment process. We have very much a pull type system where our dealers, we don\u2019t push a lot of inventory out into the market. We allow our dealers to pull it as needed and with our pretty short order windows that we at lease attempt to have, we\u2019re much more of a just-in-time type of process versus build up that inventory ahead of time sort of situation. ","So we\u2019ve been building much closer to retail and that part of the timing difference that you\u2019ll see for Deere versus maybe some of our competitors who push some significant inventory in the field ahead of those sales materializing. ","Mircea Dobre - Robert Baird","I see and then, A&T, if we can talk a little bit about Russia too. I mean the sanctions there seem to be escalating. I know you have two plants in the country. Have you seen any impact on your operations and would you sort of characterize the risk if you would to your operations in Russia at this point. ","Tony Huegel","Yes, I think that obviously those conflicts, both as it relates to the Ukraine and Russia, certainly is in our forecast. We talked about that in terms of our industry outlook being down significantly. Again, especially as it relates to western manufacturers like ourselves and so there is a number of factors obviously that go into that, that ultimately a lot as a result of some of that conflict. ","So we\u2019ve anticipated and the greatest impact we think at this point would be on the sales and so we\u2019ve pulled that into our outlook. At this point, in terms of concerns around assets, those sorts of things, not a major impact and certainly at least as it relate to sales. ","Now that we have challenges and potential challenges around import restrictions; credit availability because of that conflict is becoming even more of a difficult situation for our customers and dealers in some cases, those sorts of things. So we are looking at how do we take some of the pressure off of our dealers, keeping inventors as low as possible and those sorts of things for a variety of reasons. It reduces our exposure, but it also helps reduce the exposure of our dealers from a longer-term perspective. ","Mircea Dobre - Robert Baird","All right, thanks.","Tony Huegel","Okay, thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Your next question is from Nicole DeBlase, Morgan Stanley. ","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","Yes, good morning Tony and Susan and Raj. So may be we could just talk a little bit about used equipment. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been brought up yet. What are you guys seeing from a dealer perspective, both with respect to inventories and pricing? ","Tony Huegel","Yes, not a significant change from what we\u2019ve talked about last quarter. Again on used combines, we can tell you, all things considered we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the used combine inventory levels at our dealers. Certainly pricing we talked about last quarter, again is lower year-over-year and we tell you as it relates to at least the best intelligence we have on competitors, certainly in line with industry, in terms of those lower combine use prices. ","As it relates to tractors, again as we said last quarter, they are relatively high. Again, its reflective of the very strong demand that we\u2019ve had on new tractors, but that\u2019s an area that we certainly continue to focus. Pricing would be down a little bit year-over-year. We tell you again to the extent we have intelligence around what\u2019s going on with our competitors, we would tell you we believe our tractor prices, these tractor prices are holding in quite a bit better than competition, but it is down slightly year-over-year."," ","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","Okay great, that\u2019s pretty helpful Tony and maybe just with respect to the third quarter guidance. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re willing to give any color on this, but I\u2019m going to try any way. You said down 4% for equipment ops, any color between the C&F and the A&T segment there. ","Tony Huegel","Yes, that\u2019s not something we would \u2013 obviously if you look at the rest of the year kind of implied guidance. Certainly we are expecting some pretty strong quarter from our C&F division as we go in actually the rest of the year for that particular division versus what you would have implied in the Ag and turf. But other than that, there is not much more we would speak to. ","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","Okay, fair enough. I\u2019ll pass it on, thanks. ","Tony Huegel","Okay, thank you. Next caller. ","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz, Barclays. ","Alan Fleming - Barclays Capital","Hey, good morning. Its Alan Fleming standing in for Andy this morning. ","Tony Huegel","Hi Alan. ","Alan Fleming - Barclays Capital","Tony if I could, I\u2019d like to press you a little more on your assumptions for Ag in the second half of the year. I think in Brazil you had previously talked about growth coming from some of your other product lines such as sugarcane harvesters and cotton pickers and maybe every sprayers. Is that sill something that you\u2019re expecting to see in the second half of the year?","And then if you could talk about what you\u2019re seeing in Europe, it seems like it\u2019s a very mixed market there and we\u2019re getting I think some mixed messages from some of your competitors. So what\u2019s your visibility like and are you seeing the recovery that you expected.","Tony Huegel","Sure and as it relates to Brazil you\u2019re correct and we talked about it. If you think about the business outside of tractors and combines for Deere, in Brazil would be more than a third of our sales. There are those other products. ","And certainly if you look at industry guidance versus Deere expectations for our net sales, we would tell you we continue to see South America as the biggest differential, partly because of the fact that you are only looking at tractors and combines in the industry outlook and as I mentioned, we have a fair amount of our sales coming from other types of products, as well as our expectation that we\u2019ll continue to see those market share gains that we\u2019ve had in recent years, we would expect to continue.","So again that would be our greatest differential. As we think about Europe, certainly as Susan mentioned in her opening comments, it is really a mixed bag and we didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t change our industry outlook in Europe, so that would imply that we are at least on an overall basis not seeing further deterioration in that regard. ","We don\u2019t have the order book coverage that you would have on large Ag in the U.S. and Canada that\u2019s a typical situation there and so you can speak as well to where we are at from an order book perspective that you see in markets like the UK, which is a good market for Deere recovering off of low levels and they\u2019ve had a couple of fairly depressed years, but we are all seeing some strength there. Spain is beginning to recover. ","But then you have other key markets that Susan mentioned that are seeing some decline; France and Germany being the most notable, Poland notable as well. Keeping like some of that isn\u2019t so much around what\u2019s going and from a profitability perspective its partly related to that, but also in some of those Eastern European countries in particular, it\u2019s a transition year. This being a transition year for common Ag policy in Europe is also having some impact in certain situations. "," Alan Fleming - Barclays Capital","Okay, I appreciate that. And if I could you ask you a question on cash. I mean you continue to ratch it up, your repurchase activity. I know you\u2019re going to tell us that your cash priorities haven\u2019t changed, but is it fair to say that you seem at least a little more confident that the intrinsic value of your stock versus where its trading is undervalued and it means that it maybe a little more worthwhile for you to be more aggressive than usual with buyback.","Raj Kalathur","Hey Alan, this is Raj. Yes, our cash priorities have not changed and as you know the single A rating and then the funding of operations and M&A consistently modestly raising our dividends to 25%, 35% of fair ratio in its cycle. And then when we still have the cash that we can use, we put it to us, only if we feel long term, especially long term shareholders are going to be a value added form, okay. ","Now when we had the $8 billion share repurchase authorization, which was about 25% of our market cap, our announcement in December. We suggested that we see that the statement of confidence in our ability to do well throughout the cycle. So as long as we are generating good levels of cash and have enough of our priority stated and our analysis indicates repurchase of value enhancing, especially for our longer-term shareholders, we should expect us to continue repurchases. ","Tony Huegel","Okay, thank you. We\u2019ll have time for one more, hopefully quick call or questions. ","Operator","Your last question is from David Raso Group, ISI. ","David Raso - ISI Group","Hi, I\u2019ll try to be quick Tony. Just more direct question on the construction and revenue guidance. You mentioned the order book is healthy. The revenue guidance implies to the rest of the year 17% for C&F. Is the order book up that much? ","Raj Kalathur","Yes, we don\u2019t give you exact numbers but also remember the order book is only for a certain period of time, right. These are orders for a certain period of time. It is a lot healthier that is all I can tell you right now. ","Tony Huegel","Its certainly superiority of that outlook and that forecast. ","David Raso - ISI Group","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And the second quarter revenues for construction and forestry, I know you expected first half slower, second half stronger, I get that, but literally the second quarter. Was that revenue as you expected or above or below? ","Tony Huegel","For C&F, I don\u2019t think it was significantly out of line from the expectations. ","Raj Kalathur","So overall David, its Raj again. For the total company, if you the first second quarter and the revenues coming down in the second quarter compared to our earlier guidance, now there are two things that happened. One is related to weather and we talked about turf and we talked about a little bit with Ag, especially in Canada. The second part of it has to do with places like where the geo political issues exist, Argentina and CIS. ","So if you look at it going forward, CIS, Argentina is where we see some more softness and we will not make up all those whether related messes in the Q2, otherwise its minor adjustments, not a significant change.","Tony Huegel","And those again will be for the full company and mostly impacting Ag and I think we mentioned in the opening comments. As you think about the sales coming in lower than what we had forecasted for the enterprise, most of that lower sales was driven by Ag and not C&F. ","David Raso - ISI Group","Okay, I appreciate the clarification. Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Okay, thank you. All right, that will conclude our call. We appreciate your participation and as always, we\u2019ll be available throughout the day for return calls. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. This does concluded today\u2019s conference.

In fact, sales and earnings for 2017 were the fifth highest in the company history. Our performance was helped by improving markets for farm and construction equipment and also by our ongoing success established in a broad based product portfolio in a flexible cost structure. As a result, Deere has remained well positioned not only to serve its present customers but also to make investments needed to drive growth and attract even more customers in the future.","Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at the fourth quarter in detail beginning on slide four. Net sales and revenues were up 23% to just over $8 billion, net income attributable to Deere & Company was $510 million, EPS was $1.57 in the quarter.","On slide five, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 26% to about $7.1 billion. Price utilization in the quarter was positive by one point. Currency translation was positive by two points.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let\u2019s start with Ag & Turf on slide six. Net sales were up 22% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, all of the regions of the world were higher in the quarter, the increase was led by the US and EU 28.","Operating profit was $584 million, up 57% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in operating profit was primarily driven by higher shipment volumes and favorable sales mix partially offset by higher production cost and higher selling administrative and general expenses. Operating margins were 10.7% in the quarter. Incremental margins were about 47% for the full year, excluding the impact of items such as the Site One gains and voluntary separation program expenses incremental margins were about 33%.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let\u2019s look at some fundamentals affecting the Ag business. On slide seven, despite increasing global demand, global grain and oil seeds stock to use ratios are forecast to remain at elevated but generally unchanged levels in 2017, 2018 as an abundant crop are mostly offset by strong demand around the world. Chinese green and oil seeds stock remain high heading into 2018, after more than 10 years of supply which includes domestic production plus imports outpacing demand. Chinese grains still represent almost half of the world stock and considering that these stocks are unlikely to be exported the world market remains sensitive to production setbacks or major geopolitical disruptions. The world cotton stocks-to-use ratio has now fallen for second consecutive season and to the lowest level in five seasons reflecting stronger global demand.","Slide 8 outlines US farm cash receipts. 2017 cash receipts are estimated to be 377 billion, about 3% higher than 2016\u2019s levels. Given the large crop harvest in 2017 and consequently the lower commodity prices we are seeing today, we expect 2018 total cash receipts to be approximately 368 billion. That\u2019s down about 2% from 2017 due to lower livestock and crop cash receipts.","Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on slide 9. GDP growth in the region is improving though risks remain. Arable farm margins are below the long-term average while the dairy market is recovering with prices holding at above average levels and forecast for margins exceeding the five-year average. Sentiment remains positive for beef and pork producers though downward pressure on pork prices is possible.","Shifting to Brazil on slide 10. The chart on the left displays the crop value of agricultural production a good proxy for the health of agri business in Brazil. Ag production is expected to decrease about 4% in 2018 in US dollar terms due mainly to record production 2017 and the reversion to trend yields in 2018. In local currency the value of production is forecasted to be down about 2%.","Although forecast to be lower in 2018, ag margins in Brazil are coming off of a record year and continued acreage expansion is expected.","On the right side of the slide you see the eligible rates for ag related government sponsored finance programs. Rates for moderfrota remain at 7.5% for small and mid-sized farmers and 10.5% for large farmers. This demonstrates the government\u2019s ongoing commitment to agriculture.","Our 2018 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on slide 11. Industry sales in the US and Canada are forecasted to be up 5% to 10% for the year. Despite current commodities prices the industry is experiencing stronger replacement demand for large equipment while demand for small equipment remains solid.","Deere is experiencing strong order activity in both our early order programs for seasonal products and our order book for large tractors which are supportive of the outlook. The EU 28 industry outlook is forecast to be up about 5% in 2018 a result of margin recovery in dairy and livestock as well as improved harvest outlooks in key markets such as France and the UK.","In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2018. This is driven mainly by demand in Argentina which continues to benefit from favorable policy effects, strong fundamentals and pent-up demand.","Shifting to Asia, sales are expected to be relatively unchanged from 2017.","Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the US and Canada are projected to be roughly flat in 2018 though Deere expects to outpace the industry.","Putting this all together on slide 12, fiscal year 2018 Deere sales of worldwide ag and turf equipment are forecasted to be up about 9% including about 2 points of positive currency translation. The sales increase is led by the US market and to a lesser extent by the EU 28.","The increase in the US is due in part to significant growth in the sale of small ag and turf products which are expected to benefit from new product introductions in the year. The ag and turf division operating margin forecast is about 12.5% in 2018","Excluding the impact of special items, the implied incremental margin in 2018 are nearly 35%. Furthermore, excluding the impact of currency translation and negative mix, forecasted incremental margins are above 40%.","Now let\u2019s focus on Construction & Forestry on slide 13. Net sales were up 37% in the quarter due to higher shipment volumes, price realization and the favorable effects of currency translation. Operating profit was $85 million due to higher shipment volumes and price realization partially offset by an impairment charge for international operations. Operating margin was 5% in the quarter, but 7.5% excluding the impairment charge.","Moving to slide 14. The economic fundamentals affecting the Construction & Forestry Industries in North America continue to be supportive of increased industry demand. GDP growth is forecasted to be strong continuing a positive trend experienced during the past six months in the US and Canada.","Housing demand is growing, but constrained by supply, as a result single family home inventories continue at 35-year lows. Single family housing starts are strong across all regions in the US. Single family homes require increased earthmoving and lumber content which are important drivers of earthmoving and Forestry equipment.","Construction investment is forecast to grow in 2018 led by oil and gas and residential activity. Oil prices are forecasted to be above $50 which is important since oil and gas related activity tends to slow when oil prices are below $50 and tends to pick up when above that level. In addition, machinery rental utilization rates continue improving and rental pricing is gaining traction.","Finally, new and used inventory levels have come down and auction activity has declined substantially year-over-year. Deere's outlook also reflects a strong order book based on industry activity and positive trend in retail sales.","Moving to the C&F outlook on slide 15. Deere\u2019s construction Forestry sales are now forecasted to be up about 69% in 2018 mainly driven by the anticipated acquisition of Wirtgen as well as by strong demand in US and Canada. The forecast includes about $3.1 billion in sales from Wirtgen and assume the acquisition will close in December.","Regarding the Forestry the forecast for global forestry market is flat to up 5%, a result of improvement in the US and Canada. C&F\u2019s full year operating margin is projected to be about 8% which includes estimated purchase accounting and transaction cost for Wirtgen. Excluding Wirtgen, the division\u2019s annual operating margin is forecast to be about 10.5%.","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operations. Slide 16, shows the provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. The provision at the end of 2017 was 24 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2018 shown on the slide, contemplates a loss provision of about 25 basis points. This will put losses at the 10-year average of 25 basis points and slightly below the 15-year average of 27.","Moving to slide 17. Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $128 million in the fourth quarter versus $110 million last year. For the full year, financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $477 million versus $468 million in 2016. The higher results for both periods were primarily due to lower losses on lease residual values. Full year results were partially offset by less favorable financing spreads and higher selling, administrative and general expenses.","Financial services is expected to earn about 515 million in 2018. The outlook reflects a higher average portfolio partially offset by higher selling, administrative and general expenses.","Next, we will turn to receivables and inventories as shown on slide 18. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the year, up $1.477 billion. Ag and turf accounted for about two-thirds of the increase with the majority driven by growth in overseas receivables.","2018 receivables and inventories are expected to rise primarily due to the inclusion of Wirtgen while the rest of the business will likely see movement in line with sales. More specific guidance will be provided with our first quarter 2018 earnings release.","Moving to slide 19, cost of sales as a percent of net sales for 2017 was 77%. Our 2018 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales is about 75%.","When modeling 2018, keep these impacts in mind; Positive price realization of about 1 point. On the unfavorable side, we expect an unfavorable product mix, higher overhead spending, and increased incentive compensation.","Now, let\u2019s look at some additional details. With respect to R&D on slide 20. R&D was up 3% in the fourth quarter but down 2% for the full year. Currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 1% in the quarter and no impact for the full year. Our 2018 forecast calls for R&D to up about 18%, half of which is related to the acquisitions of Wirtgen and Blue River Technology.","Moving now to slide 21. S, A&G expense for the equipment operations was up 15% in the fourth quarter with acquisition related activities, commissions paid to dealers, incentive compensation and currency translation accounting for most of the change. S, A&G expense for the full year was up 12% due to the same factors noted for the quarter in addition to voluntary separation program expenses.","Our 2018 forecast calls for S, A&G expense to be up about 26%. Excluding acquisition related expenses, S, A&G is forecasted to be up about 2% in 2018.","Turning to slide 22. The equipment operations tax rate was 27% in the quarter and 30% for the full year. For 2018, the effective tax rate is forecasted to be in the range of 31% to 33%. The rate is a result of a more favorable mix of income, improved profitability outside the US, and structural changes within the business.","Slide 23 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations $2.4 billion in 2017. The change versus our previous forecast of about $2.9 billion was due largely to OPEB contributions made earlier than previously anticipated for tax planning purposes.","For 2018, cash flow from equipment operations is forecasted to be about $3.8 billion which includes positive cash flow from Wirtgen.","The 2018 financial outlook is on slide 24. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be up about 38% compared to 2018. This includes about 2 points of price realization and about 3 points of favorable currency translation. Wirtgen is expected to contribute about 6 points to the increase in the quarter.","The full year forecast calls for net sales to be up about 22%. Price realization and favorable currency translation are expected to be about 1 point and 2 points respectively. Wirtgen sales are forecasted to contribute about 12 points for the year.","Finally, our full year 2018 net income forecast is about $2.6 billion.","Comparing 2017 and 2018, slide 25 shows the high-level reconciliation of operating profit for the equipment operations adjusted for special items.","Operating profit was 2.82 billion for the equipment operations in 2017. Included were these special items which require consideration. $275 million pretax gain from sale of remaining interest in Site One landscape supply which has been discussed throughout the year. M&A cost of $37 million, impairment charge of $40 million mentioned earlier and voluntary separation program expenses of $92 million.","Adjusted for these factors, 2017 operating profit would have been 2.615 billion. Looking at 2018, based on the guidance for net sales changes in operating margin by segment, projected operating profit for the equipment operations is forecast to be about 3.525 billion. Included in the operating profit forecast are following items of note:","Wirtgen operating profit using very preliminary estimates for purchase accounting and deal cost is expected to be about $75 million resulting in operating margin between 2 and 3%. On a standalone basis, Wirtgen is forecast to deliver operating margin in the range of 15 to 16%. The operating margin expectation for the business going forward is in the 11 to 12% range reflecting estimated ongoing purchase accounting related expenses.","The 2018 forecast does not include any benefit from synergies associated with the Wirtgen acquisitions which as noted at the time of announcement are expected to total \u20ac100 million by 2022. Additionally, the acquisition of Blue River technology results in higher year-over-year spending of roughly $60 million as we invest in machine learning and integrated technology into our portfolio.","Taking these items into account, adjusted operating profit for 2018 is expected to be about 3.51 billion. On an adjusted basis, the comparison shows an improvement of roughly 900 million in operating profit for 2018 versus 2017, representing an incremental margin of about 33%. As a result, Deere is demonstrating improved operational performance due to disciplined cost execution, cost management and continued investment in innovative technology and solutions. This brings benefits to stakeholders in 2018 and beyond.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Raj Kalathur for closing comments.","Rajesh Kalathur","Before we respond to your questions, I want to share a few thoughts about our performance in 2017 and what we see in store for the year ahead.","First, its noteworthy that Deere has been able to perform so well for the North American market for large farm equipment, running at such a low level. Even in 2018, with the sales on the upswing we see the US market for things like large tractors, for example remaining over 25% below what we consider to be a mid-cycle level. So, there is lots of upside potential there when the market recovers.","Our ability to maintain strong performance under these conditions preach to our success establishing a broad product line up including small tractors and turf equipment as well as a more profitable international presence.","The second point concerns structural cost. Our performance in 2017 and our forecast for the year ahead provide clear evidence of the progress we\u2019ve made reducing structural cost. This is helping us generate strong incremental margins and impressive cash flow which we are using to make investments in technology and growth. We remain committed to further bringing down structural cost and it will remain a priority for Deere in the future.","Finally, a thought about Wirtgen, needless to say we remain excited about the many opportunities for growth that Wirtgen will bring to John Deere, thanks in large part to the world\u2019s growing need for roads and infrastructure. The Wirtgen acquisition also underscores the financial strength of our company consider that in the coming weeks Deere will conclude a $5 billion plus acquisition by far the largest in our history, fund the acquisition with a relatively low amount of debt and still maintain a very strong balance sheet even after the deal is completed, we believe our net debt-to-capital ratio for the equipment ops will be in the mid 20% range and that will improve throughout 2018 given the strong cash flow we are expecting.","All-in-all then, we have great confidence in Deere\u2019s present course backed by solid performance in 2017 and our strong outlook for the year ahead. We firmly believe the company is in a prime position to capitalize on the world\u2019s increasing need for advance equipment and is set to deliver stronger and more consistent results in the future.","Tony Huegel","Thank you, Raj. Now, we\u2019re ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. In consideration of others and are hope to a lot more you to participate in the call please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask you to rejoin the queue. Katy?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we would like to begin the question-and-answer session portions of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Andrew Casey","Just wanted to ask a couple of questions about the Ag and Turf outlook. Within the 9% revenue growth specifically the 10% core growth expectation, are you including any expectations for potential dealer restock actions?","Tony Huegel","If you think about and I\u2019m guessing the tip of that question is specifically targeted towards a large Ag in the US and Canada.","Andrew Casey","Yes.","Tony Huegel","And the answer there would be at this point we would be forecasting pretty much in line type of shipment in terms of retail. So, we would not be anticipating at this point in the year increasing any receivables in our field inventory on large Ag in the US and Canada. So, basically again think about it at this point building to retail demand.","Andrew Casey","Okay. Thank you, Tony. And then...","Tony Huegel","So, we\u2019re going to have \u2013 I hate to say we\u2019re going to have to limit to one question, there is a lot of people in the queue and we want to be fair to the others.","Andrew Casey","Okay.","Tony Huegel ","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs & Company. Your line is now open.","Jerry Revich","Tony, I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk about where your dealer used equipment inventories stand today and how much progress have you made over the past quarter? And just frame for us the ratio of used versus new equipment sales that the dealers are seeing in \u201817 compared to long-term averages if you could?","Tony Huegel","Sure yes, I think maybe the best way to think about used equipment is as we start to say really through 2017 and we continue to say our used equipment levels especially as it relates to large ag equipment has shifted really to being more supportive of the ability for our dealers to sell new equipment. So, we are making continued progress on that large ag inventory.","And I think if you put it in context we have if you look on products like combines and four-wheel drive tractors, those used levels are today at levels that we really haven\u2019t seen since kind of 2010 timeframe. The one challenge we would continue to have that we\u2019re still working on would be on large row-crop tractors. And again, I want to emphasize the position is much better today than it would have been 12 to 18 months ago but it is an area of continued focus for us as we go into 2018. Alright?","Jerry Revich","So, can you frame the used versus new sales, can you just give us some context on that?","Tony Huegel","Again, I think it would still be in line. Again, as we\u2019ve gone through the year, our dealers obviously they\u2019ve focused on bringing down those used. You\u2019d see a little higher than normal level of used to bring those down. I think on tractors we would anticipate a continuation of that going forward. But clearly, we are seeing some strength in the new sales as well, partly and due to the fact that dealers have been very successful in getting those used inventories more right sized.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse Securities. Your line is now open.","Jamie Cook ","Tony, just, sorry to focus so much on the large ag equipment market but you talked a little bit about your early order program. Can you just sort of provide more color across product line, how much visibility you have and how much the order book is up both for ag in the US as well as construction on an organic basis? Thanks.","Tony Huegel","You bet. Yes, and again as we talked about even last quarter on the kind of crop care early order programs as sprayers and planters up double-digits they did and so the early order program have ended up double-digits on those products. Again, keep in mind off a very low base. Our combine early order program, it will end in January but we did finish kind of the second phase of that. It also at this point is seeing some double-digit increase, now I want to be really carefully with that combine number because recognize this year our anticipation is we saw fairly aggressive orders early, it would anticipate those trailing off a bit still higher year-over-year but not necessarily that double-digit. Remember we were a high single-digit increase in 2017. So, seeing another year of strength from combines in 2018 is very encouraging.","When you think about row-crop tractors those Waterloo tractors again remember those are not on an early order program. Think about that more as kind of a traditional sequential order. And we think about availability. Really pretty much across the board on those Waterloo tractors we would see availability further out than where we would have been a year ago. Some examples, if you look at 8R tractors, our availability is out in to kind of the March timeframe versus January to early February a year ago. It\u2019s just one example and that\u2019s pretty consistent and again that\u2019s based on our current production schedules that we are seeing that type of order volume.","Maybe in summary and perhaps where I should have started is when you think about our order books relative to the forecast, our order coverage today on our original budget outlook is much stronger really across the board than what we would have seen a year ago. As we shift to C&F, I would say it is much, much stronger today versus what we would have seen a year ago at this point. We continue to see very, very strong orders for that division and again put that in context we would continue to say basically we\u2019re a quarter out generally on availability. Obviously as retail needs come in, we shift that around a little bit to accommodate needs but most of first quarter is spoken for today on orders. So very excited about where we\u2019re at from an order perspective going into 2018.","Operator","Our next caller question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is now open.","Robert Wertheimer","Good, thank you. So, the question is a little bit like what\u2019s happened in the last month or three months and just how it feels. Stop me if I get something wrong but it seems as though your receivables inventories went up which I assume is a bullish sign rather than any kind of an issue or whatever? In October obviously AM sales were really, really strong, so is there any sort of inflection, I mean what do you attribute those two factors to and maybe just comment on what it feels like?","Tony Huegel","Sure. I would say you know certainly what we\u2019re seeing in our outlook is really in what we saw in those early order programs and the tractor order book that I just talked about. I would say more as a confirmation of what we were seeing really kind of from mid-2017 forward, we talked about that replacement demand is appearing to come back and so from our perspective not a significant change.","Again, it's encouraging for sure because until you actually see those orders, you know the sentiment is just that, it's sentiment. But that we\u2019re seeing that translate into orders which is encouraging. I wouldn\u2019t read as it relates to North American Ag, I wouldn\u2019t read a lot into that receivables and inventory increase because most of that is related to outside the US in Canada, increases.","And specifically, on the receivables versus what we had previously forecasted, it things like we talked in the last year where we did have a special deal with Turkmenistan, a large transaction and the timing of that can sometimes create differences in terms of whether its settled or not and that really is what happened at the end of year, that was a big part of that increase versus what we had forecast.","So again, that\u2019s really just supportive of the strength we\u2019ve seen outside of the US and Canada through 2017 not really any significant build at all and really no builds in the field inventories in the US and Canada.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan Securities. Your line is now open.","Ann Duignan","Yeah, hi good morning. I guess since J. B. is not there I'll ask question to Raj. With Construction & Forestry, you used to say that segment has earned its right to grow, but if we look at shareholder value add over the last two years it\u2019s actually been negative. And if we look at the last four years, it\u2019s basically been flat down $1 million actually. So, can you talk about the fact we also had impairments this quarter with impairments last year the same quarter. So, Raj, can you just talk about the risk of making a big acquisition in that segment, and what we should just -- how should think about that?","Rajesh Kalathur","Thanks for the question. Of course, I want to remind you that if you took the underlying numbers that we talked about for this year in terms of margins. Josh said, it will be 10.5% margins for C&F this year, it didn\u2019t include the working portion.","Now the other part that you need remember is we\u2019ve had these growth investments in Brazil and in China that actually pull our overall margins down. We look at the margins for the core business and we know it is pretty healthy. So that\u2019s one of the requirements we have for the division and that\u2019s coming along well.","Now, supporting that as you know we\u2019re getting to be larger overtime in the production class equipment and that\u2019s going to be positive for us longer-term and even at the businesses in South America like Brazil start coming up, our factory capacity is utilized better the margins will improve there too.","So, we watch it very carefully and we know the underlying health of their Construction & Forestry business is pretty good, we want to make it better of course. And then even with the Wirtgen transaction that you think about the area that Wirtgen participate in and the type of premium they get, we anticipate as we mentioned on the call 11% to 12% tight margins on an ongoing basis even after some of their purchase accounting items. So, if you look at cash for that business that\u2019s almost 15% to 16%, cash EBIT type margin. So, overall that improves further our overall margins for C&F. So, yes, it\u2019s doesn\u2019t look good on paper when you look at it as supported but it\u2019s actually the underlying health of that business is very good.","Ann Duignan","And if you wouldn\u2019t mind just clarifying, where exactly where the impairment charges in those years?","Rajesh Kalathur","Okay. Last year impairment charges primarily for a couple of our units in Brazil and China. And this year impairment charges are for another foreign entity that\u2019s not Brazil and China, okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is now open.","Nicole DeBlase","Hi, so I guess around Ag & Turf incremental margins. I think you guys said that you\u2019re implying a step up to 35% next year and 40% ex-items. So, given that material cost is still higher and you\u2019ve talked about a little bit of incentive compensation pressure. If you could talk about the key drivers of those pretty robust incremental margins in your guidance?","Tony Huegel","Yes, and again we do not have significant material increases currently in the forecast for next year. So, we certainly had in 2017 but I would say \u201818 at least in the initial guide is relatively flat and that again is we\u2019ve talked a lot about the cost reduction programs helping to offset some of that higher cost.","As you think about obviously higher volumes will help, price realization will help, to be fair, we would be forecasting some lower warranty expense. Those would all be certainly helping from an operating profit perspective. On the flip side, we also have talked about and it\u2019s clearly in the guidance higher R&D and much of that increased R&D is related to our agricultural side of the business.","And specifically, large ag products as we start looking at new generation of products there as well there is some unfavorable mix, [indiscernible] lot of added is due to parts as well. And remember a complete good increase parts as a percent of the total tends to come down a bit. And then again, some higher S, A&G which as you mentioned would include some of that incentive comp.","It also includes things like South American business in particular improves some higher dealer commissions that flow through into those -- into that SA&G. So those are really kind of the key drivers there as we look going forward. But again, I think as Raj mentioned and Josh as well, I think it\u2019s really just evidence of the strength that the structural cost reductions are bringing and improvements that its making to the overall business to see those types of incremental.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fischer from UBS Securities. Your line is now open.","Steven Fischer ","Raj, thanks for the color on the 25% below mid cycle. I was wondering if you could sort of frame the trough and peak levels you see there in ag that kind of support that number? Because I think that would imply something like $27 billion to $28 billion of a mid-cycle ag revenue number which compares to about $29 billion plus peak. So, I was just kind of wondering how you\u2019re thinking about framing what trough and peak would be with 25% below on a 2018 number?","Tony Huegel","Yes, this is Tony. Keep in mind that was specific to large Ag in the US and Canada, and not the total Ag business. So, if you look at our current forecast for 2018 we would be closer to 90% of mid cycle for the total division. But again, I think the point is these types of returns are being recognized when our largest most profitable portion of that business is down pretty significantly and continues to be down pretty significantly.","We talked all along that versus peak of 2013 large ag in the US and Canada were down 60% or more. And you are starting to see us come off of those trough levels that are still at relatively low level. So, the good news there is as the recovery continues for those large Ag products. There is a lot of additional opportunity for profitability and certainly incremental margins as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joel Tiss ","One clarification and then a question on the clarification for Raj. On the consolidated balance sheet, the inventories are $692 million but on the cash flow statement, it's closer to a $1.2 billion of negative working capital and when you deconsolidate the balance sheet, the inventories are only up $564 million. So, I just wondered if you could get to the bottom of that.","And then the question is, is the cost per sales drop from 77 to 75, is that a structural change just because you\u2019re including Wirtgen or is there something else behind that? Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Yeah, actually the Wirtgen numbers don\u2019t change that cost of sales percentage significantly. I think if you look at cost of sales year-over-year, you\u2019re really seeing again benefit of some increased volumes as well as price realization but again it goes to as I mentioned previously, it's the benefit that we\u2019re seeing from some of those structural cost reductions that are starting to come into play in that cost of sales as well. We will follow up maybe later on your question on cash.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Joe O'Dea","Hi good morning. Just back to the comments on, you continue to pace this one with a structural savings you talk about and that initial 500 million that you targeted. Could you give us a sense of how much of that is remaining or how much of that you expect to achieve in 2018?","Tony Huegel","Yeah, you know I think really what we would say there is as business is continuing to grow, the short answer is we\u2019re basically chosen not to give a specific number I think as we talk about even last quarter, you can see it in the incremental margins, we certainly continue to be committed there. But the challenge is we have as we talked about previously, you have a structural cost programs continuing to be ongoing but then you have other levers being released, we\u2019re making different decisions around investments, R&D is probably the best example of that. That was an area that we were focused on when we were back in 2016 type of levels reducing R&D.","Now as our businesses are starting to improve we\u2019re shifting the focus there and at these levels feel the need that we need to step up some of the investment in those products again and so with all of those moving pieces, I think the way to think about the structural cost reduction is clearly in our view as being seen in the 2018 incrementals, at least in the underlying business and certainly you should expect to continue to see the benefit of that as we go forward.","Again, we\u2019ll make decisions as we go forward how much of those structural cost reductions in the existing business are used to improve margins and how much of that is used to invest for future growth and that\u2019s again consistent with what we\u2019ve said pretty much all along with the structural cost reductions.","Rajesh Kalathur","So, Joe I\u2019ll add that qualitatively, we would say we\u2019ve been very successful in our journey respect to structural cost reductions. Now as Tony mentioned, we can still a leverage we have added because of volume coming up, material inflation that we\u2019ve compensated in \u201917 an additional R&D that we\u2019re investing in and growth investments we\u2019re making and still delivered very strong incremental margins. I mean with \u201917 and \u201918 you\u2019ll see that significant benefit to cost reduction exercise is delivered.","Now, to your other part of your question, we do plan to further drive this effort in 2018 and beyond. So, clearly not done, we have more to get, we have been very successful today, we have more to get.","Operator","Our next question comes from Timothy Thein with Citi Group Global Markets. Your line is now open.","Timothy Thein","Thank you. Good morning. Tony, first just maybe a clarification on your comments earlier on the combine early order program in North America being up double-digits. My impression with that is that typically the first phase accounts for a much higher percentage of orders just because of the incentives are higher and then they kind of ratchet it down as you go through that. So, I guess my question is just with the discount structure change this year? Just I want to make sure I appreciate your comment, because again I would think that it would always be higher in that first phase.","Tony Huegel","That is certainly true and it would be still be true this year. I think the difference is as we go deeper into the program the anticipation is that where last year those orders remained actually pretty strong through the entire program we would expect it to come off a little bit versus what we saw last year. Again, I want to be clear on that early order program, our anticipation is that the combines orders will be higher year-over-year, I just want to be careful with the double-digits.","Timothy Thein","Okay. And just dove tailing on that Tony, just on the revenue progression for the year in Ag & Turf as we move beyond 1Q, the math would suggest that we\u2019re going to be moving into a down organic year-over-year change in the back half of the year. Is there something contributing that you would highlight there contributing to that?","Tony Huegel","Well, again when you think about first quarter, remember again it\u2019s a strength of the seasonal the spring season equipment or sprayers and planters in particular you\u2019re going to see some impact of that in our first quarter. And again, I want to be really careful as I talked about last year when you think about year-over-year changes in the quarter, remember we\u2019re still at pretty low levels especially large Ag in the US and Canada. So, as we contemplate the best manufacturing schedules that are going to be for us as we go into the next year, you may see some quarters that are stronger or weaker than you would typically see at least in the year-over-year comparison, you saw that last year where we had a very, very strong second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter weren\u2019t quite as strong versus what you saw in the second quarter. But for the year, very strong results and again that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to setup from manufacturing perspective what\u2019s the most cost-effective schedule that\u2019s going to drive the most profitability and the most efficiency for the year. So, you may see some quarterly shifts here and there, but again it\u2019s just us trying to accommodate the increased schedule as efficiently as we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Stephen Volkmann","Hi. Good morning, guys. I actually wanted to ask about smaller Ag, because it sounds like that in the prepared commentary that the mix was a little bit more to the small side in terms of the new product and then so forth. And can you just flesh that out a little bit or do you think that you\u2019re gaining share there. Do I have it right at that it will be kind of a higher mix in the 2018. And yeah, any color there would be great.","Tony Huegel","Yeah. Today, in our forecast -- you\u2019re exactly right, as you think about mix it is actually what while large Ag is certainly strengthened in US and Canada the mix is slightly negative for us in Ag for the current forecast. Some of that is due if you think about small equipment, the strength of the industry continues to be very high, so certainly not seeing that come off any. And coupled with that we do have some new products that would be coming into the market and of course that often results in some higher shipments for us versus the industry.","So, if you look at our shipments versus industry outlook, yes, we would outperform but a lot of that is due to some of that new equipment and filling channel with that new equipment that tends to occur. And so, our sales mix will be a bit different than what we would say the mix is for the industry retail sales in 2018. So, you are exactly right but I think underline that I think about strength -- continued strength in small ag and some additional benefit for us with new products that\u2019s driving that.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Raso ","My question relates to the Wirtgen business 2018 to 2019. Tony, you made a statement earlier about -- you gave a standalone margin which is helpful. But I think the real number was kind of run rate company with dealer amortizations about 11% to 12% margin. Is that correct?","Tony Huegel","Yes, that\u2019s correct. So, as you think about 2019 that would be the one -- at least -- again keep in mind these are very preliminary assumptions. We would expect next quarter to have a lot more specifics that we can share around that. But that 11% to 12% is what you should think about as we go into 2019. The caution I would give thereof maybe the upside to that number is it does not include any assumptions for synergies. So, to the extent we start to see some synergy benefit in 2019, that would be additive to those margins.","David Raso ","I mean that\u2019s the genesis -- basically it appears, if you\u2019re doing a 2.5% margin this year and the run rate with your amortization is 11.5%, it implies there\u2019s almost 280 million in this year\u2019s guidance that\u2019s one-time in nature, inventory step-up, other transactional fees. And then in \u201819 you get a full year where you have say a month to two months of Wirtgen that may be a 12%, 12.5%, we can swag the synergies as we like. But I mean just it seems you be implying like $0.70 delta from 2018 Wirtgen to 2019 Wirtgen. I just want to make sure we\u2019re on the same page.","Tony Huegel","No, I would not take exception to any -- I mean again you can make the swag on what you think synergies may do but it you're understanding that guide correctly.","Rajesh Kalathur","So, Dave I think overall again I want to reinforce that it\u2019s very preliminary. Now what\u2019s going well there is the underlying strength of the industry on a worldwide basis where road, construction, infrastructure that\u2019s strong tailwinds, plus the market position this entity has. Those things work really well. On a cash basis, if you embedded it's even better than the 11% to 12% that we talked about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Robert W. Baird & Company. Your line is now open.","Mig Dobre ","Tony, maybe you can comment a little more about replacement demand because obviously cash receipts in your forecast are down so are commodity prices and you know I\u2019m wondering exactly what the trigger here, is it simply related to fleet age or is this related to productivity, product introductions? Any help would be appreciated?","Tony Huegel","Yeah, I think again this is similar to what we\u2019ve really talked about through a lion's share of 2017. You know as we more forward, certainly the strength that we\u2019re seeing in large Ag is not coming from improved fundamentals, we\u2019re seeing pretty similar type of receipts and income levels year-over-year, slightly higher in \u201917 looking at least at initial forecast to \u201918 slightly lower but kind of flattish in both years.","But what we are recognizing is that at these levels most farmers are making some level of income. Okay, and I think that\u2019s one factor that you have to keep in mind certainly not what they were making in 2012, 2013 but there is some profitability there.","You also have the fact that we\u2019ve gone a number of years at very, very low level so the equipment has begun to age a bit and so that\u2019s creating some demand and it sounds like everything you just said.","We have continued to invest in our business and so we continue to bring efficient new product and new features into the market, that\u2019s certainly contributes to the desire for customers to step back and in some cases its ways that they can actually reduce some of their breakeven points. If they get more efficient equipment that\u2019s using some of those inputs more efficiently to reduce the breakeven or improve their yields, those sorts of things again kind of speaks to the benefit of our precision technology as well.","So, I would say it\u2019s a combination of those things. So obviously it's going to be different for each farmer in terms of what ultimately is driving them back into the market. But that\u2019s what's going on with the customer side and we have a dealer network who has done a lot of hard work to reduce their used inventory and put themselves in a position where as farmers are willing and interested to step back in the market they can accommodate those sales today where they would have been much more challenged a year and half two years ago to do that. So again, kind of a wide range of factors that are driving that but again we think it\u2019s really just underlined replacement demand that we\u2019re seeing and we believe it\u2019s very sustainable as well.","Rajesh Kalathur","Underlying customer economics I want to reinforce has been pretty good, not great but pretty good now for the last few years as well. Now couple of things when people focus on the commodity prices. The cost side of the farmers equation that\u2019s actually come down nicely and the other thing that lowers their breakeven point is the yield, the yield is grown. So, on the cost plus yield the economics is actually pretty good for the, while its not great but reasonably good and that\u2019s what is pulling this equation of demand and we expect this to continue and if the commodity prices come up you know then the opportunity opens up even a lot more.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry de Maria from William Blair & Company. Your line is now open.","Larry de Maria","Hi, good morning. Just to shift gears a little bit here and if you could talk maybe a little bit detail around Blue River where this is going to how you monetize it and maybe some of the financials. I think it was $300 million and related to that does the SVA model applies here or could we assume that maybe you\u2019re willing to take some bigger bets for technology away from the SVA model going forward?","Tony Huegel","Yeah. I'm going to be really brief on just again just in the interest of time. But keep in mind, as we talk about the Blue River the interest we have in that company really was around the machine learning technology, that is and continues to be an investment in future technology. And so, it isn\u2019t expected to be a revenue driver certainly in the short-term but there are wide range of areas where we think that machine learning technology really will take us into that next generation of intelligence.","Blue River is the most advanced company in that regard and puts us clearly in the lead towards implementing that in product. But, in the short-term again that\u2019s an investment in future technology, while you see in 2018 and our outlook it is the cost up and we would expect certainly long-term see some very positive returns from that investment, but it\u2019s more of a long-term play versus short-term.","Rajesh Kalathur","Yeah. The investments -- the terms are going to come in all the other equipment that very use this technology.","Tony Huegel","Exactly, yeah. ","Operator","Our final question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Seth Weber","Just wanted to go back to Raj\u2019s comment in his prepared remarks about increasing profitability in some markets outside North America. Is there any granularity around that, is it a function of better distribution, better mix, is the competitive environment changing? Maybe talk about Europe and Latin America specifically. Thank you.","Rajesh Kalathur","Yeah. I mean Latin America as an example is one that we would point to, now one, if you look at where the market is headed, it is growing more in the large Ag side which help us, we have broader base of products that we offer in Latin America and these are large Ag type products you know planters sugarcane harvest, cotton pickers and sprayers and so on in addition to the combines and tractors. So, all of those actually help us. Now the other factor you would think about is Argentina, that market opening up and there is pent up demand in Argentina, it helped us well. But in general, our ability to manufacture locally and successfully grow our share especially in the large Ag side has helped grow profitability there as well. So that would be one example.","Seth Weber","Okay. I mean can you just talk about the competitive environment there in Latin America as the business environment has softened a little bit here, in the last few months?","Rajesh Kalathur","Yeah. Again, the competitive environment has always been there. So, again we focus on the areas where we can offer a differentiated product and command a differentiated margin. And that\u2019s what we are focused on and industry growth has actually helped us.","Tony Huegel ","Thank you, Seth. And with that we will conclude our call. As always, we\u2019ll be around to take additional questions as we go through the day. And appreciate your time. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference.

Your lines have been placed on a listen-only until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. I would now like to turn over the call to Mr. Josh Jepsen, Director Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Josh Jepsen","Hello. Also on the call today are Raj Kalathur, our Chief Financial Officer; John May, President of Agricultural Solutions and Chief Information Officer; Ryan Campbell, Vice President and Corporate Controller; and Brent Norwood, Manager, Investor Communications.","Today, we will take a closer look at Deere\u2019s third quarter earnings, then spend some time talking about our markets and our current outlooks for fiscal 2018. After that, we will respond to your questions. Please note slides are available to complement this call.

Additional information concerning these measures including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures is included in the release and posted on our website at www.johndeere.com\/earnings under Quarterly Earnings & Events. Brent?","Brent Norwood","John Deere had another solid quarter with contributions from both our equipment operations and financial services group. The higher reported earnings were a result of favorable market conditions and a positive response to our innovative and advanced product lineup. In agricultural markets, replacement demand continues to drive sales activity for large equipment, while construction equipment sales benefited from increased investment in oil and gas, housing and global transportation.","Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at our third quarter results beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenue were up 32% to $10.3 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $910 million or $2.78 per diluted share. The results for the quarter included a favorable net adjustment to provisional income taxes of $62 million. Excluding this item, adjusted net income was $849 million. On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 36% to $9.286 billion. Currency translation was negative by 1 point. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 1 point. The impact of Wirtgen was 17 points.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, starting with agriculture and turf on Slide 5. Net sales were up 18% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison primarily driven by higher shipment volumes, price realization and lower warranty expenses. Operating profit was $806 million, up 16% from the same quarter last year or 35% when excluding the impact from the sale of SiteOne. Operating margins for the quarter were 12.8%. Before we review the industry sales outlook, let\u2019s look at the fundamentals affecting the ag business.","On Slide 6, corn stocks-to-use ratio is expected to decline in response to increasing global demand and drought conditions experienced during the first crop in Argentina, which lowered the country\u2019s corn production by roughly 25%. Conversely, soybean stocks-to-use ratio is forecast to build in response to higher than expected yields in the U.S. Wheat stocks-to-use ratio is projected to decline in 2018 in response to intensifying drought conditions in Europe, Australia and the Black Sea region. As a result, U.S. farmers are seeing increasing export demand for the year.","Slide 7 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. 2018 farm cash receipts are estimated to be about $375 billion, roughly flat with 2017. Crop cash receipts are projected to be on par with last year as favorable commodity prices in corn and wheat are partially offset by softness in the soybean market. Receipts from livestock are also flat due to strong domestic and export demand balanced by growing supply and lower prices. Our ag economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. While crops began to season in fair conditions, more recent results across the EU have varied due to regional droughts. Nonetheless, the overall crop value of production is still expected to increase in 2018. Overall, arable farm profitability remains slightly below long-term averages. Those severe regional droughts are negatively impacting Central and Northeast Europe, while the Southern and Western regions report more positive conditions. Furthermore, favorable wheat prices are also contributing margins in key markets. Profitability for the dairy segment remains above long-term averages though production and input costs will likely be impacted by recent drought conditions.","Shifting to Brazil on Slide 9, the chart on the left displays the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agro business in Brazil. The value of ag production is expected to be about the same as last year with strong prices in increased export demand benefiting industry sales in the second half of the year after a slow start earlier this year. On the right side of the slide, you will see eligible rates for ag-related government sponsored finance programs. In June, details for the 2018-19 Moderfrota program were announced and received positively in the market. Interest rates for large farmers were decreased 100 basis points, while popular features such as a 7-year repayment term and 14-month grace period were kept in place. Higher demand during the quarter\u2019s regional farm equipment shows reflected strong enthusiasm for the program. Overall conditions in Brazil supports solid farmer confidence as premium pricing for soybeans, lower financing cost and favorable exchange rates help offset recent increases in freight prices. These factors, along with our strong trend of operating results and market share gains positioned us very well for continued growth in the region.","At this point, I would like to welcome to the call John May, President of Deere\u2019s Agricultural Solutions and Chief Information Officer. He will provide comments on the outlook for ag and turf, an update on Deere\u2019s precision ag strategy and a review of recent M&A transactions in crop care. John?","John May","Thank you, Brent. Our 2018 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 10. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be up approximately 10% for the year. For 2018, results have been largely driven by replacement demand as customers cite the need to update their aged fleets and show a strong preference for greater productivity enabled to the latest technology. Even as trade issues have weighed on farmer sentiment more recently, we have still seen replacement demand reflected in the Phase 1 results of our 2019 planter and sprayer early order programs, which both ended slightly higher than last year\u2019s Phase 1 results. And while it\u2019s still too early to draw from firm conclusions regarding overall 2019 ag demand, it is noteworthy to highlight the early order programs, higher take rates of advanced precision features, which clearly demonstrates the economic benefits of our solutions and supports the growth of our precision ag strategy. With sentiment likely to remain fluid over the coming months, farmers continued to show a strong willingness to invest in technology that improves both productivity and economic outcomes.","Moving on to the EU 28, industry outlook is forecast to be between 5% and 10% in 2018, up from previous guidance of approximately 5%. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be flat to up 5% for the year. This is primarily driven by solid industry fundamentals in Brazil, which is offset by weakness in Argentina as a result of drought conditions experienced in the first half of the year. Shifting to Asia, industry sales are expected to be relatively unchanged from 2017 though India continues to deliver strong results in the region. Lastly, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2018. Putting this altogether on Slide 11, fiscal year 2018 Deere sales of worldwide ag and turf equipment are now forecast to be up approximately 15%. The ag and turf division\u2019s operating margin is forecast to be about 12.5% for the year, up roughly 2 points from 2017 after excluding the gains on the sale of SiteOne last year.","Moving on to Slide 12, I would like to elaborate on Deere\u2019s precision ag journey and provide insights into our current strategy. In collaboration with our product platforms, the intelligent solutions group is advancing Deere\u2019s precision ag strategy and leading the industry in machine optimization, job execution and mobile management for the farmer. Over the last two decades, we have aggressively invested to ensure our equipment is easier, smarter and more precise than any other solution available and we are committed to extending our industry leading position in the future. Today\u2019s portfolio of ISG\u2019s tools, include precision hardware, telematics, digital solution and advanced customer support. Recent precision hardware introductions demonstrated significant economic value to farming operations and in some cases already achieving take rates in excess of 50%. For example, the recently released Combine Advisor feature utilizes sensors and algorithms to automatically optimize multiple combine settings resulting in better grain quality while minimizing losses. Additionally, the introduction of our ExactApply spraying technology provides individual nozzle control to increase yields and reduce input costs by 2% to 5%.","With regards to telematics, there are currently over 130,000 ag machines in the field today. Our automatic guidance system AutoTrack delivers sub-inch accuracy and is available in 100 countries as shown on Slide 13. And it is worth noting that 2018 is a record year in the adoption of this technology. In recent years digital products have become increasingly critical to farming operations. And the John Deere operations center seamlessly manages production data and enables better decision making on the farm. Additionally the system, the most collaborative in the industry allows over 85 partnering companies to connect enabling farmers to collaborate with their trusted advisors. On a rolling 12 basis in the U.S. and Canada alone Deere has nearly 100 million engaged acres that are actively uploading data into our digital tools. Worldwide, we are seeing significant progress in engaged acres at an accelerated rate of adoption.","Related to machine optimization, we are now using technology to enhance our customer support capabilities and our expert alerts feature is an excellent example of recent innovation impacting farmers. These alerts provide predictive maintenance notifications to both the customer and the dealer, allowing farmers to avoid costly down times and enabling dealers to provide better service. Given the state of our current precision portfolio, we are increasingly optimistic about the future impact of precision technologies as the inclusion of machine learning, computer vision and robotics holds potential to unlock billions of dollars and in agricultural value.","To further advance Deere on the machine automation journey, last year we acquired Blue River Technology. Blue River is the leading integrated ag machine learning company in the industry. The acquisition provides Deere a competency in artificial intelligence which we view as core capability that will increasingly drive the basis for competition in ag equipment. This capability will enable our machines to; one, sense conditions in the field, two, make decisions, three, execute the appropriate action and four, learn and adjust. These steps could eventually shift decision making today from the field level down to the individual plant level.","Blue River\u2019s first product See & Spray is still a few years away from commercialization, but we currently are testing this product in thousands of acres this season. The product identifies and then selectively sprays weeds instead of spraying the entire field. This vastly decreases the amount of herbicide used in operation which improves economics for the farmer, while reducing chemical usage in our food chain. Last month, I had the pleasure of attending a Customer Day in Texas where over 60 customers viewed the product demonstrations firsthand, the feedback was highly encouraging and let us know we are on the right path. Ultimately, we see See & Spray as just the tip of the iceberg, but the inclusion of artificial intelligence in ag equipment. The ability to automate many farming jobs from planting to harvesting will be enabled through the use of this technology.","Turing to Slide 14, let\u2019s discuss a few other recently completed acquisitions that have enhanced our crop care product portfolio and supported the development of a global crop care solution to further enable our precision ag strategy. Over the last 3 years, Deere has very effectively utilized M&A to help execute our crop care strategy completing four acquisitions including Monosem, Hagie, Mazzotti and King Agro and the recently announced PLA acquisition. Each of the abovementioned transactions provided Deere with either a leading market position or an industry-leading capability.","To highlight a few, monism provided Deere the market-leading position in Europe for planters and will enable Deere to create the most capable tractor planter combination in the region. Similarly, the acquisitions of Hagie and PLA provided Deere leading market positions in their respective product forms and geographies. Importantly, these transactions supply Deere with the right products to combine with our foundational precision technologies and other Deere manufactured components. Perhaps most importantly, the transactions have served as a key enabler to enhance and advance precision technologies globally and a critical complement to R&D investments. With rapidly increasing adoption rates for technology, Deere is keeping pace both organic and inorganically to further extend our lead in precision ag.","I will turn the call back over to Brent Norwood. Brent?","Brent Norwood","Now, let\u2019s focus on construction and forestry on Slide 15. Net sales for the quarter, up $2.99 billion, were up 100% compared with last year driven by strong demand for construction and forestry equipment as well as well as by the acquisition of Wirtgen, which contributed 77% of the positive improvement. Third quarter operating profit was $281 million benefiting from higher shipment volumes, Wirtgen acquisition and lower warranty expense partially offset by higher production cost and higher sales incentive expenses. C&F operating margins were 9.4% for the quarter, but 10.5% excluding Wirtgen.","Moving to Slide 16, the economic environment for the construction, forestry and road-building industries look strong and continue to support increased demand for new and used equipment. For the year, U.S. GDP is forecast to grow at about 3%, which is above the 20-year average. Correspondingly, U.S. housing demand remains solid with housing starts expected to be about 1.3 million units for 2018 as inventories of new and existing homes available-for-sale remain at 36-year lows. Residential construction continues to serve as an important indicator for earthmoving equipment sales and current housing demand levels suggest continued growth in the segment. Additionally, construction investment in the U.S. is forecast to grow 3.8% for the year led largely by increased activity in oil and gas. With oil prices now forecast to average about $67 a barrel for the year, backlogs for many oilfield contractors are extending through 2019, which is supported for further equipment demand. Lastly, global transportation investment this year is forecast to grow about 6% driving increased demand for road construction equipment, such as milling machines, rollers and asphalt pavers, which are all important product lines for Wirtgen. These positive economic indicators are reflected in a strong order book, which is now extending well into 2019.","Moving to the C&F outlook on Slide 17, Deere\u2019s construction and forestry sales are now forecast to be up about 81% in 2018 as a result of stronger demand for equipment as well as the acquisition of Wirtgen. The net sales forecast includes about $3.15 billion attributable to Wirtgen, which was adjusted downward due entirely to FX. The forecast for global forestry market is up about 10% as a result of improvement in sales in the U.S. and Canada and strong demand for cut-to-length products in Europe and Russia. C&F\u2019s full year operating margin is projected to be about 8.5%, which includes the negative impact of purchase accounting and acquisition costs from Wirtgen. Excluding Wirtgen, C&F projects operating margins to be about 10.5%. Wirtgen continues to perform as expected with strong backlogs and operating margins now forecast to achieve the high-end of our 3% to 4% guidance.","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operations. Slide 18 shows the provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average owned portfolio. Financial forecast for 2018 shown on the slide contemplates a loss provision of about 15 basis points, 6 basis points lower than our previous forecast. This will put loss provisions for the year below the 10-year average of 25 basis points and the 15-year average of 27 points.","Moving to Slide 19, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $151 million in the third quarter. The results for the quarter included about $4 million in net tax reform related charges arising from the re-measurement of deferred tax asset and deemed earnings repatriation. Excluding tax reform related items, adjusted net income in the third quarter was $148 million, up about 13% compared to the same quarter last year. For the full year in 2018 net income is forecast to be about $815 million. Excluding the impacts of the previously mentioned tax reform related items adjusted net income is forecast to be $583 million. Beyond 2018, effective tax rates for John Deere Financial are forecast to be between 24% and 26%.","Slide 20 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole receivables and inventories ended the quarter up $3.8 billion. In the C&F division the majority of the increase is attributable to Wirtgen, while for ag, the increases due to higher sales. By the end of fiscal year 2018 receivables and inventories are expected to increase about $2.5 billion from 2017 levels, driven largely by the inclusion of Wirtgen as well as the higher sales across the company. Slide 21 shows the cost of sales as a percentage of net sales. Cost of sales for the third quarter was 77%. Our 2018 cost of sales guidance is about 76% of net sales, unchanged from previous guidance. When modeling 2018 keep these unfavorable impacts in mind higher production costs such as freight and material costs and higher incentive compensation costs. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about one point and a more positive product mix.","Now, let\u2019s look at some additional details. With respect to R&D expense on Slide 22, R&D was up about 23% in the third quarter. Approximately 12% of the increase relates to the acquisitions of Wirtgen and Blue River Technology. Our 2018 forecast calls for R&D to be up about 21% with acquisition related activity accounting for nine points of the increase and currency translation of one point. The balance of the R&D increase largely relates to strategic investments in large ag and precision ag that helps drive growth for these key areas.","Moving now to Slide 23, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up 19% in the third quarter with acquisition related activities and incentive compensation accounting for most of the change. Our full year 2018 forecast for SA&G expense is up about 16%. Excluding acquisition related expenses, SA&G is forecast to be flat for the year. Turning to Slide 24, the equipment operations tax rate was 24% in the third quarter, which included a favorable adjustment of approximately $62 million arising from tax reform related net deferred tax asset re-measurement and deemed earnings repatriation. Fourth quarter, the effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 25% to 27%, which implies a full year effective tax rate of approximately 55%. For 2019, Deere\u2019s full year effective tax rate is projected to be between 25% and 27%. Slide 25 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $3.5 billion in 2018 compared to previous guidance of $3.8 billion. The decrease is for \u2013 the decrease in forecast largely relates to an anticipated increase in working capital.","The company\u2019s financial outlook is on Slide 26. Fourth quarter equipment sales are forecast to be up about 21% compared with the same quarter last year. Our full year outlook now calls for net sales to be up about 30% which includes about one point of price realization and 12 points for the acquisition of Wirtgen. Finally, our full year 2018 GAAP net income forecast is now about $2.36 billion. The full year net income forecast includes charges of $741 million resulting from tax reform related net deferred tax asset re-measurement and deemed earnings repatriation. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net income is forecast to be about $3.1 billion.","I will now turn the call over to Raj Kalathur for closing comments. Raj?","Raj Kalathur","Before we respond to your questions, let me share a few thoughts on the third quarter and our expectations for the rest of the year. First, it\u2019s important to note the continued demand for ag equipment even as the industry faces uncertainty around trade. While farmer sentiment remains dynamic in this environment, it is critical to remember that we are still in a replacement market and farmers have shown continued willingness to invest in technologies that enhance operational efficiencies and produce tangible economic results. This has been evident in the initial results from our early order programs, which produced high take rates for our advanced precision features.","While it\u2019s still too early to form a complete outlook for 2019, we believe the continued ag equipment demand affirms both our significant investment in precision ag and our overall current strategy. Second, the solid levels of demand we are experiencing across our two equipment divisions have produced excellent cash flow generation year-to-date. As a result, we contributed 1 billion towards our pension during the third quarter in order to take advantage of last year\u2019s higher corporate tax rate. Additionally, we announced a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.69 per share on May 30 in order to build towards our desired dividend payout ratio that targets 25% to 35% of mid-cycle earnings. In last week, during the quarter we repurchased $400 million worth of shares. These actions reflect confidence in our ability to deliver results even in fluctuating market conditions.","Lastly, as global agricultural markets navigate uncertainty, the underlying fundamentals and tailwinds to our business model remain unchanged. Global demand for grains continues to grow consistently even as trade flow patterns readjust to accommodate various policy changes. Overall, we are encouraged by the outlook for the rest of 2018 and the early interest for our latest technology to come in model year \u201819 and we will continue to work on delivering strong results for the remainder of this year and beyond.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks, Raj. Now, we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. In consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. As a reminder, John May will be with us and available for questions. Angela?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone.","Raj Kalathur","Good morning.","Jerry Revich","John, I am wondering if you could talk about for the major equipment categories, what are the take crates that you folks saw for advanced technology, precision technology over the course of this past year and based on the results that you alluded to in your prepared remarks, what do you expect the take rates to look like as we enter \u201819?","John May","So, first of all, I think a way to think about the take rates, Jerry is there is three areas where you are going to see this technology within our equipment. Number one, it\u2019s included in our base cost of our machine and those would be things such as touch screen displays that have significant amount of software that optimize the vehicle\u2019s performance based on sensor data and feedback that the machine is getting. We also see take rates and monetization on premium options and in your report you listed a couple of those one would be Combine Advisor or active yield. These are premium options that our customers make the choice to add to their equipment. And then the third area, where we see take rates across agricultural precision ag is in subscriptions required to fine-tune the machines if you will. And an example of that would be higher fidelity guidance systems for example moving to in our RTK based systems. Overall, across the all areas of technology we have seen strong adoption. Maybe let me give you a couple of facts I think you will find interesting. If you look at AutoTrack alone and you compare AutoTrack in 2013 which was the peak year for the production of agricultural equipment. To 2018, in 2018 we sold more AutoTrack systems than we did in 2013. If you look over the last 3 years and you look at each individual region, all four regions across the globe, every year we see an increase in the overall take rate and adoption of the technologies. So that makes us really excited that number one, the customers are seeing the benefit and greater productivity, improving the cross cost structure of their business, ultimately making them more profitable and that the technology is going to continue to have significant value to their business going forward. So we are excited for what we are seeing in take rates. I can tell you in the last few years it\u2019s been more significant than we have seen in the past.","Jerry Revich","I am sorry just \u2013 yes, please.","Ryan Campbell","Maybe just an expense, this is Ryan. ExactEmerge is our most productive, most advanced row units. And the take rates from an \u201818 to \u201819 perspective they are up 50%. So just to give you a kind of an order of magnitude of what we are seeing based on the technology and the high productivity that we are delivering and a lot of our crop care machines.","Jerry Revich","Okay, perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andy Casey","Good morning and thanks. I wanted to get an update on cost headwinds, I am trying to assess if these more or less temporary and if I take the full year guidance back into the implied Q4 gross margin, it kind of looks like you are expecting somewhere around 26% if I am doing the math right and that will be a bigger year-to-year improvement than you have really seen in each of the first three quarters and a sequential step-up, I am just wondering what are you seeing that could be driving that, is that better productivity or are you seeing kind of the cost curve is flat now?","Josh Jepsen","Andy, I think when we look at if you are looking about ag and turf for example on the materials side, we do see that impact in 4Q. 4Q from a year-over-year perspective would actually be kind of the higher impact as we think about those costs coming in. We have talked about the way our contracts are lagging, so you do see that impact in 4Q. I think importantly when you think about the full year our ag and turf margins have stayed the same in light of the fact that we have seen higher material as well as an FX headwind in the quarter.","Andy Casey","Okay. And with the pricing actions that you are doing in the ongoing productivity, would you expect the gap between price-cost to narrow as you go into fiscal \u201819 or maybe neutral or positive?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. As you think about our commentary from last quarter, we would remain the same. The price actions we are taking from year \u201819, we expect to offset that material inflation that we have seen in \u201818 and \u201819. So that remains unchanged, so we feel confident in that. Thank you.","Andy Casey","Thanks.","Josh Jepsen","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning, I am sorry just a little more color on the order book, in construction it seems like you have a fair level of \u2013 very good visibility relative to what\u2019s normal, so if you can give color there as well as any more color that you could give on the ag side in terms of visibility versus where we sat last year, so if you could start there. And then Raj just another question, obviously the cash flow is strong, you are buying back stock last quarter and this quarter, the stock has come down significantly, as we think to \u201819 given your balance sheet should we think as repurchase is another lever for you guys to grow earnings? Thank you.","Raj Kalathur","Which one do you want us to answer?","Jamie Cook","All of them.","Josh Jepsen","Jamie, I will start on the order book, so on the construction side, as Brent noted we continue to see order book extend. We are well into 2019. That\u2019s really driven by what we are seeing from customer demand, contractors with backlog that are extending. So I will say good visibility there more than we would traditionally have as we think about 2019. I think for the most part we would be working into \u2013 through Q1 of \u201819. As you think about the ag side, the early order program John mentioned some, we are seeing that first phase. Even when you think about the timing of that first phase of the EOP that began in June, it ended in mid-July, so we tend to see more activity at the end of those phases even in the uncertainty that we saw that first phase ended up slightly higher. So, I think we feel good about the continued replacement demand that we are seeing drive that technology adoption, come through the business. I think as you think about tractor order book, tractors year-on-year were slightly ahead of where we were a year ago at this time on a higher production schedule. So, that would be positive as well.","Raj Kalathur","And Jamie, on the cash use, our priorities have not changed and we are generating strong cash flows and expect to generate strong cash flows throughout the cycle as we have demonstrated in the past and again mid A rating is the most important investments for growth. And as John explained to see there actually delivering very good results and we will continue to have that as our second priority. And dividends, we have always said 25% to 35% of mid-cycle earnings. What I will add there is we have more room for growth and opportunity growing our dividends and when we see it appropriate that might be an opportunity there. And on share repurchases, as you know, we always think about the long-term minded investors and adding value to them when we repurchased shares. We have also set \u2013 we think our intrinsic values are much higher, so given the current share prices, you should expect us to be buying back some shares.","Jamie Cook","Great. Thank you. I will get back in queue.","Raj Kalathur","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Adam Uhlman","Hi, good morning everyone. I was wondering if we could expand on what\u2019s happening over in Europe you raised your full year sales outlook, there is lot of crosscurrents with dairy pricing and wheat pricing. I guess, what\u2019s your view on how calendar \u2013 the second half of 2018 plays out? And then is there any inventory positioning that you are doing with emission standard changes, if you could talk through that as well? Thanks.","Josh Jepsen","Adam, when you think about Europe, I think what we have seen there is this year, we have seen dairy margins, livestock margins have held in for the long-term average, which have been supportive. I think on the arable side, we have also seen improvements in margins. This year, you are starting to see some impacts from the drought. I\u2019d say it\u2019s very regional though. And where we have seen places that have not been impacted by the drought tend to be places that are stronger important markets for Deere. So I think that\u2019s been impactful for us as we think about our fiscal year. I think that is a difference when you think about fiscal versus calendar year with some of the things that have occurred with registrations in our fiscal year, but not the calendar year. We have also seen strong wheat prices that are benefited European farmers as well that are helping to offset some of the downside that you have seen in say places that are affected by the drought.","John May","As far as the inventory goes, I mean I think overall when we think about managing our inventories, particularly field inventories on a global basis, I think we feel good about where we are at in North America large ag inventories, we continue to manage well producing in line with retail demand. So, I think no major shift or difference there small ag as we have talked about, we have strategically built a little bit of inventory to ensure that we have got the inventory in the field, because of the buying patterns of those customers. And I\u2019d say really rest of world I don\u2019t think there is any significant change in terms of our view of inventory as we think about each individual to your product line or market.","Josh Jepsen","Alright, thanks. We will go to next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven Fisher","Thanks. Good morning. Just focusing on the cost a little bit more, just other than the cost of goods sold impact, wondering if we should be thinking about other cost as net headwinds or tailwinds next year. R&D, you mentioned 21%, I think 9% organically, is that going to abate and what about other SG&A costs and incentive comp?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. I think when you think about R&D, R&D is one that we tend to look at as more of a strategic investment in the business and somewhere where we take a lot of pride and the ability to continue to invest strategically in R&D, even throughout the downturn and today in technology. And as John mentioned we are seeing the benefit of that in the adoption of technologies. So I think that\u2019s an area that we continued to invest in and probably not significant changes. SA&G, some of the things with deal costs, some of those sorts of things will roll off as you think about Wirtgen. And I think SA&G when you take out the acquisition side, we are flat on an organic basis on sales that are up high teens. So I think that\u2019s an area where we have leveraged and as we have taken costs out we have been able to adjust there.","Steven Fisher","And incentive comp, I mean should we be thinking that as a reset as a tailwind for next year at this point?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. I mean this year I would this year we are up slightly. It\u2019s about $75 million higher year-over-year. As our goals have shifted and change, it really depends on where we come in, so I would expect a significant amount of difference there.","Steven Fisher","Okay. Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.","Rob Wertheimer","Hi, you touched on it briefly, but a question on receivables and inventories which were up I think in both divisions not a ton, but for the second quarter in a row, so is there anything I don\u2019t know operationally different than you thought to work in and maybe just generally what\u2019s caused bump up?","Josh Jepsen","Thanks Rob. Yes. I think the Wirtgen is when you look at the total change is a big piece of that. I think that\u2019s just their business. They own their retail in a large part of the world and working through kind of the forecast there. So I think that\u2019s the large portion of that. I think if you look at our forecast this quarter compared to last quarter, up slightly on ag and up slightly on C&F. C&F side really in line with what we are seeing on higher sales and as I mentioned earlier the order book extending into 2019. The other piece would be as you think about on the ag side is small ag is where we are seeing some of that increase. And on inventory that\u2019s a business that is really driven more on overall GDP growth. We are continuing to see strong demand there. So I would say that\u2019s the major driver there.","Rob Wertheimer","Perfect. And the dealer inventory on the 100 plus, was up a little bit, is that kind of 105 like the fixed areas or is that anything else going on?","Josh Jepsen","I would say that\u2019s really kind of across those different categories as we talked about 100 plus is a really wide category from large utility tractors through 8000, but I think we will \u2013 as we have shifted a little bit of our seasonality this year as we talked about some of the ramp-up issues and supply constraints we have got more production in the second half of the year on large ag. So we do expect that we are \u2013 maybe a little bit atypical from normal seasonality and that we will produce and sell through that in the latter half of the year.","Rob Wertheimer","Great. Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","We will move on to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Shlisky with Seaport Global. Your line is open.","Mike Shlisky","Good morning, I wanted to maybe ask more questions on the Wirtgen here, can you give us a sense as to what the organic growth outlook is there, has it changed from earlier in the year, if you could also share I know it\u2019s early about has Wirtgen gotten any share gains in the U.S. so far as we are starting \u2013 a few quarters ago?","Josh Jepsen","Mike, when we look at Wirtgen, their business is performing as we expected, if not better as we talked about, we have seen actually margins have has stepped up over the last couple of quarters. The revenue guide was really just impacted by FX. And when we look at the order backlog there, it continues to be really strong. So as we look to their continued growth, I think we have noted in our slides we think that global kind of road building, transportation sector is up about 6% year-over-year and up higher little single \u2013 low double-digits, excuse me in some of the key emerging markets. So I think that\u2019s continuing to perform as we would have hoped.","Mike Shlisky","And as far as the share gains are concerned, if you have gotten anything so far this year you think?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. We don\u2019t have a lot of additional detail or comments there I think performing as we would continue to hope and expect.","Mike Shlisky","Thanks, Josh.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks Mike. We will go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Seth Weber","Hey, good morning guys. Wanted to go back to a couple of prior questions, I think Andy and Steve just asking about costs and thinking about the margins, it looks like your implied incremental margin on ag and turf is kind of a mid 30% range for this fourth quarter, but Josh you said that this is kind of the high point for the cost headwind. So I mean does that \u2013 are you comfortable with us thinking about incrementals next year in ag and turf should be better than that sort of mid 30% range? Thanks.","Josh Jepsen","Seth, when we think about the fourth quarter, I think as we talked about there is FX headwind and you got some of the material and freight headwinds in the quarter. So that is particularly impactful in the quarter. I think as you think about going forward, obviously, we don\u2019t have a forecast for 2019 yet, but we will have the price that comes in that impacts the cost inflation that we have seen. And as we have discussed, we expect that offsets the inflation material that we have seen in \u201818 and \u201819. So that will be impactful and beneficial too to our margins. I mean, if you look at our margins today full year, up just below 25% \u2013 around say 23% if you excluded the material freight impact, you would be at that about 35%.","Ryan Campbell","And this is Ryan. Fourth quarter, just to clarify correcting for foreign exchange, we are right in that mid 20s range, which is consistent with what we have had for the full year.","Seth Weber","Okay. So, it\u2019s not that kind of low to mid 30s, it\u2019s because FX was kind of skewing that number, is what you are saying, Ryan?","Ryan Campbell","Yes. Some of the things that Josh talked about with respect to material obviously are hitting us. We have got the R&D step up that we have talked about. So the implied number is in the teens if you adjust for FX, you get to the mid-20s, which is consistent with what we have been saying. And then as Josh said the pricing actions that we have announced entering the marketplace should give us comfort and give everybody comfort that we feel good about going into next years from an incremental margin perspective.","Seth Weber","Okay. We will follow-up offline. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning.","Josh Jepsen","Good morning.","Ann Duignan","I wanted to ask a question about your lower warranty cost in the quarter. And I would like you to square that with your discussion of your telematics and technology at predictive maintenance enabled to help farmers reduce their warranty costs and how do you square both of those with the fact that we are now in a replacement cycle where farmers are feeling the need to replace their equipment, because they are afraid of having a high warranty cost, their equipment is coming out of warranty? Do you just like square all those pieces together first with the lower warranty, lower expense, lower accruals versus farmers replacing, because of their fear of higher warranty costs? Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","I think there has been a lot of focus on warranty and making sure we are continuing to get products to customers and they are having a good experience to us and we are reducing the cost of warranty and as you noted rightly, the reducing downtime which is particularly concerning. As it relates to our offerings, I will let John talk a little bit more about it, but certainly the \u2013 what we are doing on a predictive maintenance perspective does help in reducing warranty, because you are taking care of issues before they pop up, but I will let John maybe expand a little bit on that.","John May","Yes, thanks for the question, Ann. If you take a look at the fact that we have 130,000 large ag, large production machines that are in the field today that we are connected to and they are streaming data to us as they are in the field. We have the ability based on the data we receive and a set of advanced algorithms to predict failures before they happen, communicate the potential of a failure to the customer and to the dealer. And then within minutes, the dealer could be on the phone with the customer, with the solution that\u2019s part of that expert alert. Just to put it in perspective for you, if you look last year we just launched the technology. We had machines streaming in over 11,000 alerts that they were predicting before machine had actually failed, that has a big impact on quality and a big impact on uptime for our customers.","Josh Jepsen","Thank you.","Ann Duignan","So you think that will lengthen the lifecycle of the equipment and lengthen the replacement cycle?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. And we will take that offline. Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe O\u2019Dea with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask on the construction pricing side of things, I mean it sound like on ag in terms of the price increases we really won\u2019t see take effect until next year, which I think makes sense given a full order book for this year. Anyway, on construction I think you are implementing some price increases middle of the year in response to some of the cost inflation, but when do we start to see that flow through the P&L just given the size of the order book and strength that you have on that side as well?","Josh Jepsen","Thanks Joe. This is a good question. I mean I think on the construction side we have continued to see a pretty competitive market. As you pointed out and we talked about last quarter, we were planning some price actions \u2013 price realization actions in the second half of the year. We actually put those into effect as a discount reduction that took effect July 1. And we did see the benefit of that in July. So our expectation is we continue to see that benefit in the fourth quarter. And then as we started to think about model year \u201819, we will continue to look at \u2013 be market based, what\u2019s going on, but also cognizant to the fact that you have got your material prices and other things moving up.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Got it. Thank you.","Josh Jepsen","Thanks. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Steve Volkmann","Great. Thanks guys and good morning. I just had kind of big picture question, I guess we can all sort of try to figure out the tariffs and all that other stuff, but given that we are sort of starting our replacement cycle here, would you expect absent things like tariffs and major changes in farm income, etcetera, would \u2013 do you think ag sales would be up more next year or sort of the similar amount or maybe less, I am just trying to get a sense of what you think the replacement demand is?","Josh Jepsen","Yes, that\u2019s fair. I mean I think what we are seeing is the replacement demand is continuing. I think over this some of these months we are seeing some of the sentiment obviously be weighed upon with some of the trade concerns, but continuing to see that demand for equipment. And really I think what\u2019s important is not just a new buyer looking for updated tech, the latest technology and productivity, but is working down through that trade ladder. So whether it\u2019s the second third or fourth buyer, they are upgrading technology as well. And I think that\u2019s really important in terms of what we are seeing. I think when step back and look at the fundamentals, really from where we are quarter ago, they haven\u2019t necessarily changed in terms of cash receipts are relatively flat to where we were and demand for grains globally continues to grow and drive where we are at.","Raj Kalathur","Hey Steve, this is Raj. Let me add a few more comments to what Josh said. The situation right now is dynamic for the farmers and this can change. But as we see it right now the farm economic conditions between \u201819 you think about the crop fundamentals would actually strengthen for double crops like corn, wheat, cotton which outweigh soy situation, okay. And as result we forecast like total cash receipts a leading indicator for our large ag sales. For 2019 to be higher than for 2018, that would say absent all of these other noises that the demand will be up. Given the anticipated commodity prices and input costs, we would anticipate metric tons per acre for major crop farmers, large ag customers to be higher in 2019 than 2018. Now, for an illicit of Midwestern farm, say half corn, have beans, half land rented we see the economics is indicating metric tons per acre to be stronger, perhaps some even up to 20% above this year. Now, this would be the highest metric tons per acre that farmers would love seeing over the past 5 years or so. And on the cost side you were to say remember some of this cost is too high if conditions were more in equilibrium, okay? And if something changes, there is an opportunity for the cost to come back down and that can be beneficial, now it may go up if few things show up, but so overall the point being made is that the farm economics picture for next year may actually be stronger than realized because of improving commodity market fundamentals worldwide with little change in farm costs. Uncertainty surrounding the trailer market availability conditions may have distracted from the North American farm economics today. So thank you.","Steve Volkmann","Okay, great. Can I get just a quick follow-up, Raj, if we had something similar than let\u2019s call it\u2026.","Raj Kalathur","We will take it offline.","Josh Jepsen","Yes, we will follow-up offline, Steve. Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ross Gilardi","Yes, good morning guys. I just wanted to ask a bit, how these high take rates for some of these advanced features influence both revenue growth and drop-through margins, I mean could it actually add a couple of 100 basis points of growth into next year? And I would think the drop-through on some of these advanced features is a lot higher than it would be for the equipment itself, could you comment on that? And then just any thoughts on this $12 billion farmer subsidy, how it would work and any sense of how much of that would potentially be going towards equipment?","Josh Jepsen","Thanks Ross. I think to maybe start with the latter on the $12 billion of farm aid. I think have you been viewed positively as a short-term solution but doesn\u2019t really address the bigger issue, which is getting a long-term resolution to some of the trade concerns. I think there is still a fair bit of uncertainty in terms of how that program will work in the three different components. You have got the market facilitation that\u2019s the big piece, expect it to try to cover some of the impact of trade, particularly on soybeans, which is I think assumed to be the vast majority of those dollars and then the food purchase as well as trade promotion. So I think there is still a lot of questions, my understanding is I think later into August and early September, there will be much more clarity around how those programs come together and how those payments will transact, but I\u2019d say right now, I don\u2019t know that those are necessarily being factored in due to the calculus for farmers today. As you think about your question on kind of the technology take rates and what does that mean to margins, I think as we talked about, we are very, very encouraged by what we are seeing in terms of take rate growth as we talked about 50% higher on ExactEmerge, ExactApply 10% higher, some of those Combine Advisor active yields were nearly double our expectations this past year. So that adoption combined with the growth in engaged acres and some of these other pieces I think are promising. As we think about margins, we have not dialed in exactly what this means from a margin perspective or carve that out, but we do feel like it will contribute is and will contribute to margin growth in the future. Today, obviously, there is lot of investment going along with lot of these features, but we think there is economic value to be unlocked with our customers and that we will be able to share in that.","John May","Yes, I think this is John May. The only thing I would add is I think if you look at from a customer\u2019s perspective and you look at the fact that when they acquire these technologies, the payback from their perspective is less than a year and there has been some recent reports out there that would show that in some cases the payback is within months, which generates strong productivity, strong profitability for our customers, which has a big benefit to our customers.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. I think it\u2019s I mean a way to think about it. These are offerings that are margin improving for us and significantly margin improving for our customers.","Ross Gilardi","Thanks very much.","Josh Jepsen","Alright. Well, we are at the top of the hour. So, we appreciate everyone\u2019s participation and we will be available and do callbacks. So we will talk to everyone soon. Thank you very much. Have a good weekend.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

Josh?","Joshua Jepsen","Thanks Tony.","John Deere today reported solid financial results for the third quarter and did so inspite of the continuing impact of the global farm recession and difficult conditions in the construction equipment sector. All of Deere's businesses remained profitable for the quarter and earnings per share was slightly higher than last year.","Operating profit for Ag and Turf division and for the equipment businesses overall was above last year's levels even though sales were down nearly $1 billion. Our results were helped by the sound execution of our operating plans, the impact of a broad product portfolio and our success keeping a tight rein on costs and assets.","Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter in detail beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 11% to about $6.7 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $489 million. EPS was $1.55 in the quarter.","On Slide 4, we see that worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 14% to just under $5.9 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by two points. Currency translation was negative by two points.","Turning to our review of our individual businesses, let's start with agriculture and turf on Slide 5. Net sales for the division were down 11% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison with the decrease primarily due to lower shipment volumes in the United States and Canada. Also affecting sales was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange.","Operating profit was $571 million. Ag and turf operating margins were 12.1% in the quarter. The gain on the sale of a partial interest in SiteOne landscape supply contributed nearly two points of operating margin in the quarter. Even excluding the SiteOne impact operating margins were above the levels of last year's third quarter.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, we are pleased to welcome Deere's Chief Economist Dr. J. B. Penn. He will spend a few minutes sharing his thoughts on the state of the global Ag economy. J.B.?","J. B. Penn","Thanks Josh.","I would begin with a bit of context that might be useful as we ponder the outlook. Slide 6 shows the strong tailwinds that now drive the global agricultural economy. Major changes in agriculture and food markets began occurring sometime around the turn of the century and that ushered in a dozen or so unparalleled years characterized by strong demand growth, record high prices in farm incomes, food price spikes, expanded investment and innovation and increased trade.","A convergence of forces was responsible. Global population growth, widespread global economic growth especially in emerging market and developing countries, rapid urbanization and biofuels. Now in 2000, the UN was projecting that the population would grow from 6.1 billion in that year to 9.3 billion by 2050. Today that projection for 2050 is 9.7 billion, so that\u2019s another 2.4 billion from today\u2019s 7.3 billion people.","Although having slowed somewhat, the global expansion continues especially across much of the developing world bringing millions more into the middle class and enabling ongoing improvements in diets.","On urbanization, we passed the 50% mark of population sometime around 2010 and that is now expected to approach 70% by 2050 with implications for food production and trade.","Now Slide 7 reflects global Ag as a whole showing the production and consumption of all global grains. Now perhaps the most noteworthy point of this slide and one often overlooked with all the focus on supply, acreage, and yields and that is the persistent consumption growth.","Consumption remains very strong, still rising steadily year-after-year and it has risen without fail every year since 1994, 1995 even including the great recession of 2009. Now fuelled by earlier high prices and after four consecutive great growing seasons worldwide, commodities supplies now are fully adequate to meet all needs. Prices of course have moved off the previously high levels and farmer margins have narrowed.","Slide 8 provides more details showing global stockholdings and the supply to use ratio. While carryover stocks have reached levels of 15 years ago and physical quantities it is important to remember that we are now consuming one third more grains, so the supply use ratio is the key indicator. While it has moved above the average of recent years, it remains in a sensitive area and especially so when viewed with Chinese grain stocks excluded. Notably the Chinese are thought to hold about 45% of the global stocks and the supply use ratio actually has ticked down the last couple of years when the Chinese stocks are excluded.","Now Slide 9 illustrates that even with abundant supply the production consumption balance still can shift rather quickly. Any significant production disruption will tilt the supply use ratio downward and prices will immediately move higher. The recent price movements in response to reports of relatively minor weather events certainly highlighted continued sensitivity.","You will note from the slide that both corn and soy futures were trading in a rather narrow range in the first four months of this year. Then we saw some reports of adverse weather in Brazil and Argentina in April prices quickly reflected the uncertainty brought. Corn moved almost $0.90 bushel higher, soy moved $3.25 a bushel higher that's an increase of 25% for corn, 36% for soy.","Then by late June, the South American weather conditions abated followed by the early July USDA WASDE report, indicating larger acreages of both corn and soy. The weather premium quickly disappeared from the corn price and it was reduced per soy.","Now just for reference, the U.S. drought in 2012 reduced corn yields 22% below trend pushing ending stocks to barely 800 million bushels and prices to new record high. But this year a corn yield reduction of only 4% would have been sufficient to reduce ending stocks to $1 billion bushels and push prices to $5 per bushel or higher, a further illustration of the sensitive supply utilization balance. Now there was some expectation that farmers would reduce acreage in response to the softer prices as we came into the Northern Hemisphere planting seasons.","On Slide 10, we know that despite the softer prices farmers worldwide did not reduce acreage. Now in the United States farmer supply response this year was influenced by market prices of course which provided a paired, but still positive margin, but they were also influenced by farm program subsidies, revenue insurance and production cost decline.","For example of the subsidy, the agricultural program ARC County forecast of 2015 payments for Illinois is $0.37 per bushel on corn-based acres and $0.98 per bushel on soybean based acres. So as a result of this combination, U.S. farmers this year expanded planted area for all major crops except wheat illustrating continued profitability despite softer prices.","Now we also expected a similar reduction in other parts of the world, but we noted there that farmers supply response was influenced largely by currency values and also some policy shifts notably in Argentina. And this crop year major exporters expanded grain and oilseed area all around the world and grains and oilseeds were up 3.7% in South America.","As an example Brazilian farmers saw corn prices in reais of $5.24 per bushel in September 2015 compared to $3.43 per bushel a year before indicating that it was still very profitable to continue to expand.","Now Slide 11 speaks to the financial condition of the U.S. farm sector. Overall the farm sector balance sheet remains strong. Farmer debt has been well managed. The financial indicators are still solid. It was not until a 2000 that farm sector equity reached $1 trillion, but then it took only 10 more years to add second trillion dollars and five years later we have added another $0.5 trillion.","Now a major part of that balance sheet of course is farm land and USDA forecasts land prices to decline in 2016, crop land to decline 1%. This is the first time since 2009 and only the second time in almost three decades.","Now Slide 12 summarizes the situation across the global Ag sector. As I noted, supplies are fully adequate, the risk premium have been erased from the grain market. We saw very little reduction coming into the year in response to the lower prices and that was because of the aberrational forces at play, the subsidies, the risk measures and also currency values which boosted commodity prices and we're in the fourth consecutive favorable weather year.","So adding all of those things together barring adverse weather events, little near term improvement in Ag market conditions is anticipated but we would note that the long term drivers, population growth, income's growth and urbanization are still intact.","Now Slide 13 pertains to the U.S. Ag sector and we note that farming is still profitable despite softer prices as evidenced by the continued expansion of planted acres this year and financial conditions across the sector remain solid. There is some individual farmer stress to be sure but no widespread stress is yet evident.","And finally Slide 14 lists some key factors that are worth watching in the coming months. And in the short term of course weather is key. We know that demand is strong. We now know that supply depends upon the weather so it\u2019s still weather is the major market disruptor and it's still one season at a time.","Attention now will turn from North America to the southern hemisphere as the planting growing season gets underway there in late September and October we\u2019ll continue to watch that until next spring in the northern hemisphere when we will start focusing on planting and growing conditions here. And over the longer term, I would just note that any of these geopolitical hotspots that could erupt and become a drag on global GDP would be a negative.","Lots of other things to watch include relative currency values and the political situation in several countries, central bank behavior all over the world and so I would just conclude by noting that after a dozen years of unprecedented prosperity planting, commodity price, food price and trading patterns are now stabilizing. A new commodity price trading range with favorable weather is emerging and weather remains the major commodity market disruptor. The outlook is still one year at a time depending upon the weather.","I will now turn the call back to Josh.","Joshua Jepsen","Thanks J.B.","Our 2016 Ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 15. You\u2019ll note there are no changes from our previous forecast. Low commodity prices, weakening farming income and elevated used equipment levels in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipments especially high horsepower models.","We expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 15% to 20% for 2016 with sales of large Ag equipment down 25% to 30%. The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5% due to lower crop prices and farm incomes as well as persistent pressure on the dairy sector.","In South America industry sales of tractors and combines are expected to be down 15% to 20% in 2016. This is a reflection of the downturn in Brazil and other commodity driven markets in the regions.","Shifting to Asia, the industry sales outlook continues to be flat to down slightly. This is due in part to weakness in China partially offset by improving conditions in India where the monsoon rains have been higher than normal.","Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016, again no change from our prior forecast.","Putting this altogether on Slide 16, fiscal year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide Ag and turf equipment are forecast to be down about 8% including about 2 points to negative currency translation. This is unchanged from the previous forecast. Our forecast for the Ag and turf division\u2019s operating margin is now about 7.7% for the year with an implied decremental margin of about 15%.","Now let focus on construction forestry on Slide 17. Net sales were down 24% in the quarter and operating profit was down 58% due mainly to lower shipment volumes and an unfavorable product mix. The division\u2019s decremental margin was 20%.","Moving to Slide 18, the economic indicators noted at the bottom of the slide although down somewhat from the previous quarter remain positive. Notwithstanding these positive signals the market demand for construction equipment continues to soften. Among the factors contributing to the weakness, conditions in the oil and gas sector continue to be slow with the impact most pronounced in the energy producing regions of the U.S. and Canada. Contractors are less apt to replenish or grow their machine fleets when faced with uncertain markets.","Rental utilization rates continue to decline leading to a reduction in fleet sizes and higher levels of used equipment. Also housing starts in the U.S. for single family homes which require more earth moving equipment remain well below the long-term average.","As a result Deere's construction and forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 18% in 2016. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 1 point. The global forestry market forecast remains down 5% to 10% primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 4.1%. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 31%.","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services. Slide 19 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio which was 24 basis points at the end of July. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2016 contemplates a loss provision of about 23 basis points, unchanged from the previous forecast. The provision remains below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points.","Moving to Slide 20 worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Co was a $126 million in the third quarter versus a $153 million last year. Lower results for the quarter were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, a higher provision for credit losses and higher losses on lease residual values. The division\u2019s forecast net income attributable to Deere & Co remains at $480 million for the year.","Slide 21 outlines receivables and inventories. For a company as a whole receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $764 million. We expect to end the year with total receivables and inventories down about $500 million with reductions coming from both divisions.","Field inventory to sales ratios for new large Ag equipment are expected to end the year in line with 2015 year end levels which is consistent with our previous forecast. C&F inventory and receivables to sales ratios are forecast to end the year roughly in line with last year\u2019s levels as well.","Our 2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on Slide 22 is about 78.7%. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable factors in mind, an unfavorable product mix and engine emission cost. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point, favorable raw material costs lower pension and OPEB expense and lower incentive compensation expense.","Now let\u2019s look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D on Slide 23, R&D was down 2% in the third quarter. Our forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1% for the full year including about 1 point of negative currency translation. This is consistent with our previous forecast.","Moving now to Slide 24. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 10% in the third quarter. Most of the decline was attributable to incentive compensation, commissions to dealers, pension and OPEB and currency translation.","Turning to Slide 25, our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 5% with incentive compensation, currency translation and pension OPEB accounting for about 6 points of the full year change.","On Slide 26, pension and OPEB expense was down $53 million in the quarter and is now forecast to be down about $210 million in 2016.","On Slide 27, the equipment operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter and is now forecast to be in the range of 29% to 31% for the full year.","Slide 28 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is forecast to be about $2.1 billion in 2016.","The company's fourth quarter financial outlook is on Slide 29. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 8% compared with 2015. This includes about one point of price realization and favorable currency translation of about one point.","Turning to Slide 30 and the full year outlook, the forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 10%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about one point, with negative currency translation of about two points.","Finally our forecast now calls for net income attributable to Deere & Company to be about $1.35 billion for the full year. In closing, Deere continues to perform well in the face of challenging market conditions and this is particularly true in relation to previous farm recessions. Our performance in the third quarter and for the year-to-date underscores our success developing a more durable business model into wider range of revenue sources.","At the same time, we are continuing to look for ways to make our operations more profitable and efficient by seeking out further structural cost reductions. All-in-all, we remain confident in the company's present direction and believe Deere is on the right track to deliver significant value to its customers and investors in the years ahead.","I will now turn the call back over to Tony.","Tony Huegel","Thanks Josh.","Now we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. However as a reminder in consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Timothy Thein from Citigroup Global Markets. Your line is open.","Timothy Thein","Thank you. So Tony, some pretty big moves during the quarter that you alluded to in both corn and soybeans, I guess, or grains in general. But I'm curious, what you're hearing just in terms of overall sentiment from your dealers in North America, and how that's kind of influenced farmer decisions? And especially how that kind of carried through in terms of the early - the spring early order program, how that finished relative to last year. Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Thanks, Tim. Yes, as you might imagine, and we talked last quarter and even the early part of the third quarter where sentiment was a bit more positive as those commodity prices were up, and as we mentioned there, that can change in a hurry, and it certainly with the commodity prices coming down, I think it's fair to say the overall mood would be less positive than it was a couple months ago even.","Related to the spring seasonal equipment, we just finished the first phase, remember these are multiphase early order programs, so I want to stress it's still quite early, but we did see on some of those key products like planters and sprayers as well as spring tillage equipment. We are seeing those early order programs down year-over-year, but as you think about the magnitude of that decrease considerably less of a reduction versus where we were a year ago.","In fact if you look at just a plant or EOP in particular, which is often considered a good indicator for large Ag and its current environment, orders are down in the single-digit range. So just to give you an idea, again, I would stress that it is quite early.","Operator","Our next question is from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andy Casey","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Ag and turf margin question. You mentioned the margin increased even without the SiteOne gain. First, was that gain consistent with the 76 million identified in the 10-Q, and then axing the gain out, really it's the first positive year to year gross quarter of 14 but the implied Q4 guidance suggests a fairly deep year to year decline. I\u2019m just wondering what drove the improvement in Q3 and what's changing in Q4 to drive a continuation of the margin declines.","Tony Huegel","Yes, certainly, you know, the third quarter was a very strong quarter for Ag and turf, you know, on lower sales, the operating margins were higher. Obviously price realization continues to be very strong. You point out the SiteOne gain that was about 75 million. I think Josh indicated, just under two points of margin there.","So really a lot of it was cost management, and so we had lower production costs, things like obviously incentive comps, material costs continued to be a tailwind for us. Obviously it had a little higher Tier 4 emissions costs. SA&G was also lower. So those were some of the positives. Obviously volume and FX continued to be drags on the profitability as well.","As you look out into fourth quarter, I think a couple of things to keep in mind, one is mix shifts, so as you think about the production, a couple of our key factories in particular, you think about Waterloo with large tractors as well as harvester works will see considerably lower production in the fourth quarter of '16 versus '15.","Just to put some context around that, harvester works for combines would be about a 60% reduction in output hours and Waterloo is about a 20% reduction in output hours, so a couple of, very profitable products for us. The production will be down pretty considerably.","The other thing, I think that's worth noting is material costs. That\u2019s been a nice tailwind for us through the first three quarters of the year. That actually becomes more flattish. It's slightly negative, but really more flattish in the fourth quarter, so you lose the tailwind in the quarter would be the other item I'd point out. So those are probably the biggest differences as you move into the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse Securities. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning, I guess Tony, the question I usually ask. Can you just talk about the progress that you've made, you know, in the U.S. or North America on the used equipment issue, where we are relative to last year and relative to your expectations and what that implies for - do we think we have to take incremental inventory out on the used side in '17. Thanks.","Joshua Jepsen","Thanks Jamie. Used equipment, and I want to kind of parse that out again as we always do. When you think about large Ag used inventory, we continue to be down about 23% from the peak of kind of summer of 2014. That's consistent with where we were at the end of last quarter, but keep in mind, seasonality does create a challenge in terms of even keeping things flat, so I would say that, that is kind of as expected, at least in line with what we would expect.","We would hope to see and certainly expect to see progress continue to resume in fourth quarter with that number continuing to move back down, but to your point, we still have a significant amount of work to do yet this year but even into 2017, so, that kind of talks to the inventory balance a bit, and I think when you look at the balance sheet of dealers and the pricing and the valuation of that equipment, generally what we're hearing is that dealers are feeling a little better about the income or the equipment that they do have and the value that it's at on their balance sheet.","We've seen some pricing stabilization on used equipment, so, again, I think things are stabilizing but I want to be clear we have a lot of work on the actual level of used inventory at our dealers that will continue into 2017.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thank you, I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Next question is from Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Eli Lustgarten ","Good morning everyone. Very nice quarter. One thing economists look at by the way is that the - big movements in commodity price particularly in corn were related to 252,000 money manager wrong contracts that unwound in 11 days to a negative 100. I mean it was really money managers drove it more than the free market. That's public data by the way.","My question really is looking at production levels that would go into the fourth quarter and actually into next year. You've indicated your inventory levels will be sort of that same place at '15 but we're talking about a U.S. market that's down 20%, 25% and almost 30% percent in big tractors and probably may have some minor fall next year.","So it's just suggested there's either plant shutdowns coming now or in early 17, and that has - will probably have some weight on the $0.35 that you sort of forget for projecting for the fourth quarter. Can you give us some color on how production levels you started a little bit on, how far down the fourth quarter will be but the inventory levels aren't going to go away. The big shock for farmers\u2026","Tony Huegel","I'm going to jump in here because, A, I think you're mistaken in what we've said. Okay, we're not saying that the field inventory levels are the same. We're saying are going to be in line as a percent of sales they'll be in line, so that's implying large Ag is down pretty considerably when you look at field inventories.","So, again, the reason we're clarifying that is as we talked earlier in the year, when you're looking at total Ag inventories and receivables, you have small Ag in there as well, and we've seen some increases there. But if you look at just large Ag we have taken pretty comfortable reductions in the year to keep those inventory and receivable levels in line with the sales when we get to the end of October, so I think that that's probably the most important statement.","In regard to 2017 shutdowns and production schedule, we'll talk more about that next quarter when we have the 2017 outlook. So anyway, appreciate the question and we'll move on to the next caller. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Good morning, everyone. Tony, can you please talk about your allocation of pool funds between used transactions versus new this year or the dealers use of pool funds I should say, and how we should think about as we enter 2017 where that balance of allocation of use of pool funds shakes out between new and used just put it into context versus history for us if you don't mind.","Tony Huegel","Sure, Yes, and I think there can often be confusion around pool funds. When we refer to pool funds, at least in the U.S. and Canada, those funds are only for used equipment. They earn them on the sale of new equipment, but it's really the funds that are available for them to provide incentives for the sale of used.","So we often talk about one way they can use those is for helping to subsidize the floor planning but they have of used equipment as well as actual retail, and so we do - we do tend to manage that. There was a period of time where we were starting to see a shift towards more use of wholesale financing and floor planning, but that has shifted back to a very attractive use on actual retail, and pretty much in line with what we would expect.","So that's been a positive trend that we saw really early in the year, and it's continued through the year on pool fund. So another question around there that I'll throw in as a bonus is you look at pool funds in aggregate, we would say certainly as we look at that relative to used inventory, we would be comfortable in aggregate.","As we said before, there are clearly some dealers who we would look at and say their pool funds - you know, are too light relative to the used equipment that they have, and that's when we have those individual conversations with those specific dealers. But in aggregate still at healthy levels.","Jerry Revich","Appreciate the bonus. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Lawrence De Maria from William Blair. Your line is open.","Lawrence De Maria","Thanks, good morning guys. I want to ask about - a little bit about the FINCO and some of the headwinds that are potentially going forward around residual values. I think if we look at the book they said around 64%. That's up significantly from a decade ago around 40%, 42%.","I guess I'm kind of wondering what kind of risk you guys see from that declining given the weaker market prices we're seeing over the last couple of years and what kind of headwinds to think from that over, the next, maybe year or two I guess.","Tony Huegel","If you think about the operating leases just kind of in general, hopefully the read through as you look at the quarter is things seem to stabilize, at least in the short-term in terms of the losses that were recognized, you know, no additional impairments, those sorts of things. Obviously the forecasted income for financial services stayed the same, all positive signs, but to your point, you know, I would say in the near term, short to midterm, there's still certainly risk.","As we look at future maturities we continue to work hard to reduce the return rate on those maturities as well as finding more effective ways to dispose of those when they get returns so that the loss rates are not as significant, but as long as we stay at these lower levels, as long as, you know, used equipment prices continue to be at more depressed levels, I think that continues to bear watching and certainly has risks.","So while we take some comfort in the short-term with the stabilization we saw in the quarter, it's going to be a while before we're willing to say we're out of the woods there and so to your point, stay tuned and certainly we would be deciding that at some additional risk.","Lawrence De Maria","Right. So to that point, Tony if I could just follow up. When would we expect some of the biggest returns to occur given the peak few years ago and the duration of some of the leases on there, would that kind of the returns for the peak in '17 or '18 or are we going through that kind of bell curve now?","Tony Huegel","You're hitting some of that now. We'll hit some pretty strong maturities in the fourth quarter of this year, and then certainly as we move into spring, you know, next year is I think another kind of wave of maturity. So think about timing of when you tend to see a fairly healthy level of retail activity that's when you're going to see some of those - some of those peak.","So let's go ahead and mover. I appreciate the question. Let's move on to the next caller thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Raso from International Strategy & Investment Group. Your line is open.","David Raso","Hi, good morning. Really just a kind of big picture question about, you know, all that you know about your new and used inventory in the channel and how production is this year versus retail. Just for a generic framework, if hypothetically retail was flat next year for Ag globally and maybe the same question for construction, how would Deere's production be in that environment, up, down, in line with that retail environment? Just trying to think through all the under production, versus inventory draw down needs. Just wrap it all into that one question.","Tony Huegel","Yes, I think in both cases, I would say in line with, which would imply higher year-over-year sales.","David Raso","Can you repeat that if flat retail\u2026","Tony Huegel","In line with retail.","David Raso","Yes.","Tony Huegel","Which would imply higher sales because we're under producing this year.","David Raso","That's sometimes so just be clear, your production would be higher than retail?","Tony Huegel","Correct. Yes.","David Raso","And when it comes to the mix of that\u2026","Tony Huegel","No, no. Our production would be in line with retail, but it was less than retail in 2016.","David Raso","Okay. Let's not confuse it with the comp, just straight out if retail is flat?","Tony Huegel","Yes.","David Raso","Deere's production year-over-year is flat or up?","Tony Huegel","Our production is higher, because we will produce in line with retail. So our year-over-year production will be higher.","David Raso","Okay. And a follow-on that the mix within that, if retails flat, but Deere is up because, you're under produce last year, this year, I mean next year you want it under produce, is that particularly a harvester works, Waterloo comment or how should we think about that on the mix of up and flat?","Tony Huegel","It's certainly our greatest under production than large Ag in the year. So mix would be favorable year-over-year.","David Raso","And does that comment hold for construction in core shares as well?","Tony Huegel","That I don't have the details on as well, I have a hard time to answering that so yes, all right.","David Raso","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Joe O'Dea","Hi, good morning. On the construction front, could you just talk about kind of where your demand levels stand relative to what you see in the end market activity, and if you see anything on the horizon where some of the challenges from oil and gas or some of the dealer destock if you see some potential near term release from that so that such that your demand could improve?","Tony Huegel","I think in the short term and what you're seeing reflected in our outlook on construction is our dealers do continue to be so flat. So as the market continues to decline as we would expect them to and hope that they would they are bringing their inventories down in line with that. Some of that actually is related to the lead times we\u2019re able to have right now in our factories with the lower production, they can get replenishment, the equipment pretty quickly and as a result of that they are able to do more of that de-stocking and make sure that they are putting their inventories in a good low level type of environment.","So as I turn that around a little bit to the extent you start to see positive turns in that market our dealers are likely in our - would respond maybe a bit more aggressively as dealers would need to do a little bit more stocking up. So it does have some negative now but more positive when the market does eventually rebound.","Joe O'Dea","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Yes, hi good morning. Good morning J.B., I hope all is well there. My one question, I need to waste my question I guess but it\u2019s one that I am wrecking my brain over. Did you actually record a mark-to-market gain on your 9.5 million remaining shares at SiteOne in the quarter?","Tony Huegel ","No we did not.","Ann Duignan","Okay. That\u2019s my question and thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Seth Weber","Hi, good morning. I want to ask about Brazil. I mean I know you didn\u2019t update your outlook for South America for this year but some other data points that we\u2019ve been getting, some of the shipment data our of Brazil for the last couple of months has been a little bit better. Do you think that\u2019s a market that could be up next year?","Tony Huegel","Certainly, I mean if you ask me today which market was likely if I had to pick one which one has the best likelihood of being up, I think I would have to say Brazil or South America in general. One of the things to keep in mind is and we talked about this throughout the year is a lot of downturn there has been related to the uncertainty around the government and the overall economy. Farmers have been pretty profitable.","As a result of that with the new government at least today there appears to be a more positive sentiment, inflation is coming down as an example so the overall economy seems to be showing some level of improvement.","And in the short term we\u2019re seeing that in the order books as well. Now, the question there is remember there is a conversion to Tier 3 what we consider Tier 3 on January 1 in Brazil on large Ag equipment so that will and dealers know and customers know, that will come with the price increase. So undoubtedly some of the at least short-term order book activity we\u2019re seeing is strength around that buying equipment ahead of the Tier 3 conversion.","So the real question remains, will we continue to see that demand surge as we go into calendar 2017 or not. But again I think there is some fairly favorable signs that would indicate that could possibly be the case.","Seth Weber","And have you been building inventory for that emissions change?","Tony Huegel","Our order books would reflect demand related to that but we have not built inventory ahead to have on our dealer lots to lead further into 2017.","Seth Weber","Okay. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Wertheimer from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.","Robert Wertheimer","Hi, good morning. Did you see any sequential materials cost reduction that was meaningful to margin, I mean the margins were very strong in Ag and turf on revenues that was down sequentially material seasonally obviously. I am just curious about if you can bridge whether materials is a big part of that or whether it\u2019s something else?","Tony Huegel","Actually, if you look obviously we don\u2019t give the actual number any longer but it would benefit in the quarter for Ag would have been slightly less than second quarter for material.","Robert Wertheimer","And that\u2019s on a year-over-year basis, okay fair enough.","Tony Huegel","Yes, so again it\u2019s starting to come down a little bit which you would expect as we\u2019re looking some slight increase going into the fourth quarter. There was really, certainly was contribution but it was holding other costs and finding ways to operate again as efficiently as we can at these low levels and so they just did a great job working through some of those costs.","Robert Wertheimer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Shlisky from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.","Michael Shlisky","Good morning guys. Just checking out your slides towards the back, you did update your outlook for the 2016 cash receipts I do see that but I don\u2019t see in there a 2017 outlook although at this time last year in \u201915 you gave us a 2016 outlook. And so kind of wondering if that\u2019s just a reflection of the uncertainty out there or could at least give us maybe a base case scenario or directional view for next year\u2019s restates for both crops and livestock. Thanks.","Tony Huegel","Yes, that was - you noted correctly. That\u2019s actually a change we did make this year. Historically we would have provided the first look at a cash receipts forecast out into the future year and candidly it\u2019s just too in our view at this point it is just so pretty mature and preliminary that we decided that would make that change this year. And I\u2019ll note that USDA doesn\u2019t provide, it won\u2019t provide their first 2017 cash receipts outlook until February of 2017.","So historically we were almost six months ahead of the USDA and so as a result we\u2019ve decided that we will wait. We do expect in November that we\u2019ll have again it\u2019ll still be very preliminary but we will have our first 2017 cash receipts outlook. I would tell you if you look at our number I would call it flattish as this point year-over-year but again I can\u2019t emphasize enough. It\u2019s very, very premature.","Michael Shlisky","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Mircea Dobre from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mircea Dobre","Good morning, this is Mircea Dobre with Baird. A quick question back at Ag and turf, Tony can you give us any color at this point how much turf and maybe the smaller equipment contributes to operating income and am also wondering how you are thinking about smaller equipment and inventory in the channel, is there any risk of destocking here into next year? Thanks.","Tony Huegel","We don\u2019t provide any profitability breakdown by large and small. We do on a annual basis provide some sales breakdown as you know but I think the second part of your question is worth noting especially when you think you about small Ag I would say the higher end of that small Ag business so what really it is attributed to livestock we have seen some softening in the retail environment around some of those product categories as the livestock margins have gotten squeezed a bit.","And you\u2019ll actually see that reflected a little bit in some of the inventory levels that we report in the appendix. So the 100 horsepower and above you\u2019ll see I forget what slide that is Josh, do you mind look at that up quick. But if you look at it you\u2019ll see still on the mid 30% range.","Joshua Jepsen","47%","Tony Huegel","47% where we\u2019d be back down typically in the 20% range. Really what\u2019s driving that is the 100 to 200 horsepower the 6000 series tractors are a bit elevated but it\u2019s possible last quarter we talked about this and said this was likely that our expectation is would have those in line year-over-year with some of the weakness in livestock.","It\u2019s possible that number will be a bit elevated, it should come down but it may not hit quite the same level that we were at as we ended 2016 but again that product is coming from Germany so there is longer lead times not building to retail order, we\u2019re building to forecast and that retail sales forecast has slipped a bit in the quarter and obviously it\u2019s wasn\u2019t dramatic enough for us to change the overall retail sales outlook but it did soften some.","Mircea Dobre","But Tony, isn\u2019t there a bit of an issue with under 40 horsepower as well?","Tony Huegel","From an inventory perspective I don\u2019t believe that is the case and you\u2019ve seen ours come up. Now remember our sales - our inventory levels are coming up but our sales are too. So it\u2019s really coming up more in line with the sales at this point.","Mircea Dobre","All right thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Fisher from UBS Securities. Your line is open.","Steven Fisher","Thanks. Good morning. So it looks like your leasing exposure went up in the quarter to about 5.6 billion, it\u2019s up around a 100 million. Can you just talk about how your efforts to effectively discourage some of that leasing activity is being received and when might you expect to see that lease exposure actually start to come down?","Tony Huegel","Yes, I think you are right in the sense that the overall lease activity has continued to increase, so I think what's also worth nothing is the short term leases and the activity there is down significantly. And so lot of the actions that we were taking at the end of second quarter and into third quarter were focused on reducing those short term leases and that has been effective.","And so we are pleased with that certainly I think, again you know we said this before our preference would always be a retail node over an operating lease that to the extent our customers continue to prefer an operating lease, our obligation there is to make sure we are structuring those in a way that John Deere Financial can continue to be profitable.","So that\u2019s where we are focused on. Last quarter we did raise residual values, can\u2019t say across the board but pretty much across the board not just on short term leases. But, I\u2019m sorry we reduced residual values pretty much across the board last quarter to try to correct some of those challenges that we had been facing. All right?","Steven Fisher","Can you quantify what the percentage of short term lease is now and how much - and if declined in the third quarter per se?","Tony Huegel","I don\u2019t have that number off-hand, but if it was a significantly lower number in the quarter.","Steven Fisher","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question is from Joel Tiss from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Tiss","Just snuck in there, I will make it quick too. In financial services it seems like the debt is rising roughly about $2 billion while the portfolio is shrinking. I just wonder if you could explain what's going on there?","Rajesh Kalathur ","Joel, I'm not sure we are tracking all. Our debt-to-equity ratio, we try to maintain at 7.5 to 1 and that\u2019s been close to that, so we still maintained it around 7.5 to 1. And our portfolio overall has been slightly lower and even if you take a constant FX it\u2019s about flat. So the portfolio has not grown.","Joel Tiss","Yes, I know but the debt is up $2 billion over since the end of the year. All right I will ask you later.","Tony Huegel","Okay. And I think we did have one more come into the queue so we can go ahead and take that.","Operator","Our next question is from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan Securities. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan ","Yes, thank you for squeezing me in. My question is more on the European end markets and we saw German registrations down 21% last month which I don't know if we have ever seen it drop like that one month and I recognize its registrations, not retail sales. Can you just talk about the environment in Europe and France, Germany and U.K. and also how you are feeling about dealer inventories in the region?","Tony Huegel ","Yes, certainly, you track things like there is a seam of business parameter and so on. We started seeing even a quarter or so ago that's starting to track more negative, a year ago at this time that was actually moving a more positive direction and we had some relatively positive hope for Europe as it went into 2016.","I think in the short term certainly you have a lot of factors like Brexit and so on that are causing some uncertainty. There were some challenges and if you look at some of the Eastern part of the EU28 with subsidies and timing of when subsidies were released again.","And then when you look at France, I mean you are starting to see some indications that the crop there is certainly not what many had hoped and so you are seeing some weakness there. So I think certainly you are seeing a sentiment get a bit weaker here in the latter part of the year. J.B or Raj, do you have anything?","All right, beyond that I am not sure there is much more, I would say it's your point, it\u2019s one month, it\u2019s registrations I wouldn't read too much into a single month.","Ann Duignan","And dealer inventories?","Tony Huegel","Yes, dealer inventories I think we are reasonably comfortable with, that's one where again we would say used equipment, not an issue at this point but one we certainly have our eyes on and I'd say cautionary. Actually one of the bigger challenges there had been Great Britain, U.K. and with some of the FX and it was if the FX it held up pretty well.","With Brexit now and the FX changing, that\u2019s actually in a short term created some benefit for their used equipment to move because most of that of course comes to the mainland and gets distributed kind of the Eastern part of Europe. So that\u2019s been a positive again very short term impact of Brexit.","Ann Duignan","Okay. Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Thank you. And before we close Raj has a couple of comments he would like to make.","Rajesh Kalathur","So there have been some questions around our third quarter margins and fourth quarter margins and around 2017 what to expect. I just wanted to make a few comments along those lines. We have mentioned in the past that each of our units plan for the mid cycle trough and peak scenarios, in addition to the following year's forecast and you will have noted our decremental margin performance in the last three years show how well we have executed in this downturn.","Now as a result of our disciplined process, our margins have improved about 300 basis points at mid-cycle volumes now compared to mid-cycle volumes in 2010. So we have been working on reducing our SA&G, overhead expenses and also structurally reducing our material costs. We have diverted more of our R&D resources to focus on cost reductions in the last two years and we have increased focus on efficiency improvement and structural cost reduction activities broadly and in general.","Now with such structural cost reduction activities, we expect to improve our pre-tax income by at least $500 million by the end of 2018 if large Ag down turn persists at current levels. Now I should also say our internal goals and targets are even larger. Having said this, you should also note that we have balancing structural cost reductions with investments for the future and we remain committed to maintaining manufacturing capacity to support an eventual turnaround. Thank you.","Tony Huegel","All right. Thank you, Raj, and with that, we'll conclude our call. We appreciate the questions and we of course will be around throughout the rest of the day to answer any follow up. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect."],"7099":["Deere & Co.

Thank you, Susan.","Susan Karlix - Manager, Investor Communications","Thank you, Tony.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Now, Josh.","Joshua Jepsen - Manager, Investor Communications","Thank you, Tony. With the announcement of our first quarter results, John Deere has started out 2016 on a profitable note. Our results, however, were lower than last year reflecting the continuing impact of the downturn in the global farm economy and weakness in construction equipment markets. All of Deere's businesses remained solidly profitable for the quarter. This shows our continuing progress, managing costs and creating a more flexible responsive cost structure. We also lowered our annual guidance for both sales and earnings, with most of the change due to foreign currency and weaker markets in construction equipment.","Now, let's take a closer look at our first quarter results in detail, beginning on slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 13% to $5.525 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $254 million. EPS was $0.80 in the quarter.","On slide four, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 15% to $4.8 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by two points. Currency translation was negative by four points. In comparison with our previous net sales guidance of down about 11%, the difference is largely attributable to lower sales volumes for Agriculture & Turf equipment.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on slide five. Net sales were down 12% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. The decrease was mostly due to lower shipment volumes of large Ag equipment in the United States and Brazil. Partially offsetting these declines were higher sales in Europe. Foreign currency exchange had a negative impact on sales as well, largely driven by the euro and Brazilian real.","Operating profit was $144 million, down from $268 million last year. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by lower shipment volumes, unfavorable foreign currency exchange, and a less favorable product mix. These factors were partially offset by price realization, lower selling, administrative and general expenses, and lower production costs. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was about 26%.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the Ag business. Slide six outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the record crop harvests of the last three years and the resulting lower commodity prices, our estimate for 2015 cash receipts is now down about 10% from 2014's peak levels. Our 2016 forecast contemplates total cash receipts to be about $381 billion, down slightly from 2015.","On slide seven, grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels on a global basis, even after the abundant harvest of the past three years. Global grain and oilseed demand remain strong, while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tensions could result in prices quickly moving higher.","Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on slide eight. Economic growth is improving at a moderate pace. Farm income remains below the long-term average, and weakness persists in the dairy sector. As a result, we're expecting lower industry farm machinery demand in the EU region.","On slide nine, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for China and India. Because of the economic slowdown in China, we continue to anticipate lower industry sales. While the government support of mechanization is helping the sector, changes in government subsidies are causing uncertainty.","Turning to India, the government continues providing assistance to the Ag sector with programs such as minimum support prices for commodities. Although the region has experienced two consecutive below-normal monsoon seasons, our forecast calls for a modest rebound in industry sales in 2016.","Shifting to Brazil, slide 10 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness there. Ag production is expected to decrease about 2% in 2016 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. The situation, however, is more positive in local currency due to the devaluation of the real. Brazilian farmer profitability remains at good levels as crops are sold in dollars.","Although Ag fundamentals remain positive, farmer confidence is low due to economic and political concerns, growing inflation, and uncertainty over government-sponsored financing programs, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. In spite of these short-term concerns, the long-term fundamentals for our Ag business in Brazil remain strong.","Our 2016 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on slide 11. You will note there are no changes from the guidance provided last quarter. Low commodity prices and stagnant farm incomes in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, with the decline being most pronounced in the sale of high-horsepower models. Our forecast for industry sales in the U.S. and Canada remains down 15% to 20%, with large Ag equipment sales down 25% to 30%.","The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5% in 2016 due to low crop prices and farm incomes as well as continued pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be down 10% to 15% in 2016. Shifting to Asia, sales are expected to be flat to down slightly, due in part to weakness in China.","Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016, benefiting from new products and general economic growth.","Putting this all together on slide 12, fiscal year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 10%. This includes about four points of negative currency translation. The deterioration in our forecast is driven almost entirely by foreign currency exchange. Ag & Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 7% in 2016, unchanged from the previous forecast. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 23%.","Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry. Net sales were down 23% in the quarter as a result of lower shipment volumes and unfavorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by price realization. Operating profit was $70 million in the quarter, down from $146 million last year. The decrease was driven by lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. The division's decremental margin was about 21%.","Moving to slide 14, looking at the economic indicators at the bottom part of the slide, GDP growth is positive, construction spending is up from 2015 levels, and housing starts are expected to exceed 1.2 million units this year. In spite of these encouraging signs, the industry is operating at a slow pace. Contributing factors are weak conditions in the North American energy sector and the movement of equipment from energy producing regions to other parts of the country.","Rental utilization rates continue to decline, economic growth outside the United States is sluggish and the mix of housing starts in the U.S. is skewed to multifamily homes reducing demand for earthmoving equipment. As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 11% in 2016.","The change from our previous forecast is largely driven by lower sales in the United States and Canada and a negative foreign exchange effect of about one point. The forecast for global forestry markets remains down 5% to 10% from the strong levels we've experienced in recent years, primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 7%. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 27%.","Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 15 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. At the end of January, it was eight basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2016 contemplates a loss provision of about 19 basis points. Even so, this would put the year's losses below the 10-year average of 26 basis points, and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points.","Moving to slide 16, Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $129 million in the first quarter versus $157 million last year. The lower results were primarily due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange translation, higher losses on residual values, primarily for construction equipment operating leases, less favorable financing spreads, and a higher provision for credit losses. These were partially offset by lower selling, administrative, and general expenses.","2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $525 million which is down from last year. The outlook reflects less favorable financing spreads, an increased provision for credit losses and the negative effects of currency exchange translation.","Remember that 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of the crop insurance business of about $30 million. Before we move on to receivables and inventory, let's discuss the losses on residual values noted in the earnings release that affected the quarter's results. A majority of the losses were due to impairment charges for construction equipment. The losses were mainly related to short-term leases of production class equipment. We continue to closely monitor the leasing portfolio, adjust residual values on the existing portfolio as needed, and take appropriate actions on new contracts to ensure we are mitigating future risk.","Slide 17 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $205 million. We expect to end 2016 with total receivables and inventory down about $550 million with reductions from both divisions.","2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on slide 18 is about 79%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind. Unfavorable product mix, Tier 4 product costs, and overhead spend. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about two points, favorable raw material costs, lower pension and OPEB expense, and lower incentive compensation expense.","Now, let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D expense on slide 19, R&D was down 4% in the first quarter including about two points of negative currency translation. Our 2016 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 3% with about one point of negative currency translation.","Moving now to slide 20, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 11% in the first quarter with currency translation, incentive compensation, and pension and OPEB accounting for about eight points of the change. Our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 4%. The same factors just cited for the quarter also account for about six points from the full year change.","Turning to slide 21, pension and OPEB expense was down $44 million for the quarter and is forecasted to be down about $200 million for the full year, unchanged from the previous forecast.","On slide 22, the equipment operations tax rate was 20% in the quarter, primarily due to discrete items. While it's not our practice to provide specifics on discrete items, I would point out the R&D tax credit was extended for 2015 during the quarter. For 2016, the full year effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 33% to 35%.","Slide 23 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $2.1 billion in 2016. The reduction from our previous guidance is largely attributable to the forecasted change in working capital and lower net income.","The company's second quarter financial outlook is on slide 24. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 8% compared with 2015. This includes about two points of price realization and unfavorable currency translation of about three points.","Turning to slide 25 and the full year outlook, our forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 10%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about two points. Currency translation is negative by about three points. Finally, our full year 2016 net income forecast is now about $1.3 billion.","In closing, although Deere expects another challenging year in 2016, our forecast represents a level of performance that is much better than we have experienced in previous downturns. This illustrates the continuing impact of our efforts to establish a more durable business model and a wider range of revenue sources. At the same time, Deere's financial condition remains strong, and the company is continuing to forecast a healthy level of cash flow this year. As a result, we're well-positioned to continue looking to the future and making investments in innovative products, advanced technology and new markets. These actions, we're confident, will deliver significant value to our customers and investors in the years ahead.","I'll now turn the call over to Tony.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Josh. Now, we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure, but in consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, again, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue.","Carlos?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question will be coming from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse Securities. Your line is open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, good morning. Congratulations, Susan. We will miss you. So in terms of my questions, I guess, Tony, last quarter you talked about production in large Ag and you talked about as we think about the back half of the year that production should be more in line with retail demand. Can you talk about if there's any change there? And then also any progress you made on the used inventory issue within large Ag. Thanks.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah. So as you think about inventory and some may have noticed kind of along that line with the receivables and inventory forecast that it is \u2013 it did change and the reduction is actually a little lower from what we had in the original budget. And I would point out first of all that's really more related to changes in small Ag. So if you look at large Ag, the forecasted change in dealer receivables is really very, very similar, very much in line with what we had in the original budget. Used equipment, we continue to make progress. It's still \u2013 as we talked about previously, there's still a lot of work there, especially on large tractors.","I think last time we talked about down 18% roughly from the highs that were set in 2014. Today, we would put large Ag used at about 23% lower. So again, continuing to make some good progress there. Maybe as importantly, as we bring that down, used pricing on our large Ag equipment is remaining steady. So again, continuing to make progress, but those efforts will certainly continue through 2016.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Joshua Jepsen - Manager, Investor Communications","Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody. Congratulations, Susan. My question is on the cost structure here, Tony. And I'm trying to figure out \u2013 I know you have some flexibility. You've shown some really good control on these decremental margins, and I know your most recent contracts have given you some increased down days and weeks and so forth. And I guess I'm just trying to figure out where we are in that process, and if things get weaker, do you still have additional levers you can pull? Or are we getting to the end there?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Certainly. To your point, from a production perspective, we do have some additional \u2013 we went from \u2013 in our UAW factories previously we had 10 weeks per year, and that has gone to 16 weeks with the new contract this year. That does provide some additional flexibility, and we would have additional flexibility. We've also talked in our forecasts for R&D, while down a bit, is not a lever we pull significantly hard at this point.","And again, that is trying to take a long-term view. So depending on if our perspective changes in terms of the length of this downturn that would be certainly an area we would continue to be able to pull levers. I would note, from original budget, our SA&G forecast has come down further in terms of what we're forecasting. That's an area we continue to look at and attempt to identify costs that can come out and as those are identified, we'll add those into the forecast. So again, I don't want to imply however that we have the same type of leverage that we would've had coming off of the peak. Obviously, we're already at very low levels. So our ability to pull costs out relative to any further sales declines will be more challenging.","We've been pretty open about that. This year fortunately with incrementals or decrementals as the case may be, we've gotten some benefit from the pension and OPEB change and some other factors, lower material costs and those sorts of things and so \u2013 but still I think it's demonstrating that we are very focused on cost management and doing an effective job to date. So...","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","So, someday there will be incrementals again?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Absolutely. And I'll look forward to that.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","All right. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Timothy Thein from Citigroup Global Markets. Your line is open.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Just, Tony, the question relates to your degree of confidence on that one and a half to two points of positive pricing that you're expecting for this year and I'm sure you're going to have a lot more visibility on that in the next month or two. But just maybe update us there in terms of any changes, especially interested in C&F. Obviously, you're a lot lower contributor to the overall pie. But just in light of this current and revised forecast, maybe just update us of your thoughts on pricing overall. Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Sure. I think the important thing maybe to note is as you look at that two points of price realization, both divisions continue to contribute positively to that two points of price realization, and so that has not changed. Certainly, the price environment is very challenging, especially for construction. We have a large competitor who has been pretty open about some negative pricing for their business. And so far, our business has been able to hold the line and keep pricing on a positive slant. That is a challenge, however, but one we remain focused on as we go forward. All right, next caller?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Robert Wertheimer from Barclays Capital. Your line is open, sir.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Congratulations, Susan. We'll miss you, just a quick question on your priorities on use of cash flow. Your down cycle progresses a little bit. There's a little bit less cash flow to be had. Would you see cutting back on share repurchases as the first thing? Would you do anything less with the leasing? What are you thinking on just as you get to the normal, more cyclical lower levels of cash flow?","Rajesh Kalathur - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","This is Raj. Now, I want to first say our cash flow from operations is still pretty strong, over $2 billion. And we've talked about our cash use priorities several times in the past. They remain the same. So our highest priority is our single-A rating. We are maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity, and maintaining access to attractive funding sources is even more important during a downturn like right now. So next priority is organic and inorganic investments that will benefit the company in the long term. And we are, as Tony mentioned, continuing to invest in R&D, especially with a focus on innovation. And we take a long-term view with respect to inorganic options, and we have discussions over multiple years sometimes with inorganic options that are aligned with our strategy. So we recently announced two acquisitions. One was Monosem, based in France. The other was Precision Planting, based in the U.S. And we will use about $325 million of cash for just those two.","The next priority is dividends. And our goal is to keep dividends at about 25% to 35% of mid-cycle earnings, and we will maintain our dividends even through difficult downturns. And finally, share repurchases are a residual use of cash and deployed only if the distance from intrinsic value is significant, so it's beneficial to our longer-term shareholders. While the distance from intrinsic value makes repurchases attractive now, our higher priorities will obviously take precedence.","So the other point I'll make is you may recall that quarter one is typically a significant user of cash on the operations side. So if you put all those together, I think that's a summary of what our thought is on the cash.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Next caller? Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, your line is open.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody, and all the best, Susan. I'm trying to reconcile the unchanged U.S. and Canada Ag & Turf outlook and the modifications you made to the commodity outlook in the appendix. In the appendix, you decreased the farm cash receipts projection for 2015 and 2016 mostly due to livestock but also in the crop area. And then the net cash income projection for 2015 and 2016 dropped about 8% and 16% respectively. But despite all of that, you maintain U.S. and Canada end market view. I'm just wondering if you could help us understand why the reduced farm financial outlook really did not impact the end market view.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Sure. At this point, while certainly the statistical modeling that we have in place and looking at farm cash receipts and so on still play somewhat of a role in our forecasting, at this point in the process, the actual orders would tend to take a stronger \u2013 make a stronger impact on the forecast. And as we're seeing those orders come in, we're still very much in line with what we had had for our previous forecast. So we are seeing sales down certainly for North American Ag with a greater impact on the large Ag business, but I would say our order books are very much in line with that outlook.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Hi, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just a quick clarification first before my question. Monosem and Precision Planting, are they now included in your revenue guidance, and how much do they impact your revenue guidance?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","We closed on Monosem in the quarter, so they certainly would be, and we would anticipate some in the forecast for Precision Planting as well.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And how much are they adding to your outlook?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Okay. This is going to have to be your question, Ann, so...","Rajesh Kalathur - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So all I'll say, Ann, is both of them together will be slightly accretive for us and very small in terms of their revenue, so it's not really \u2013 I think let's leave it at that.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Okay. Ann, I'm sorry. You'll have to get in back into the queue for your next question. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good morning.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Hi, Joe.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","On Financial Services, the revenue \u2013 or sorry, the net income in the quarter was roughly in line with what you were guiding for the full year if you just spread it equally. But could you talk about the cadence that you're looking at whether or not over the course of the year you anticipate some reduction in the receivables book, and how we should think about any oscillations throughout the course of the year?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","I think as you think through the back half or through the remainder of the year, one thing I would point out is if you look at our forecast for the provision versus the year-to-date annualized number, it would anticipate some increase there in terms of cost. Certainly, at these lower levels of sales while the average portfolio doesn't change dramatically as you move through the year just like we saw last year you would start to see some impact from that as well. So certainly you see some \u2013 a little bit lower receivables as we go through the year. So I'd say those are probably the two biggest differences from first quarter in terms of headwind for Financial Services as you go through the rest of the year.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you. Yes, next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning, everyone, and congratulations, Susan.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Hi, Eli.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Let me just ask a question on the decrementals and production schedules. It's sort of interesting, I think you said the decremental in farm was 26% and the year is 23% and it's a reverse case, 21% in construction and 27% through the year. Can you talk about how you change your production schedules leading to farm getting better and construction getting worse, it sounds like you cut production a lot more in the second half of the year in construction and sort of maintained a balance in farm?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Certainly as you look at the forecast, I'll start with construction, when you look at the forecast change for construction, most of that change is really as you look out toward the back part of the year. So as we talked about last quarter, there was some optimism, if you will, towards the back half of the year that we'd start to see, not an incredible amount, but some increase in sales as we went through the year. Most of that optimism candidly has been removed from the forecast, and so what we are forecasting today for construction is we think normal seasonality. So you will see some improved sales as you go through the year, but really nothing beyond again a typical seasonality.","So with Ag & Turf again, you get some better clarity as you go through the year. We talked about some higher level of impact of FX as well, that certainly \u2013 FX tends to from a decremental perspective provide a little bit of benefit and boost of decremental. So that would also be contributing to some of the change in our forecast, the decrementals on Ag. Those would probably be the highlights I would point out.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. We had in our meeting with Sam Allen. He basically made a statement that you did little cuts in construction equipment and should have done it bigger. Was there any reason why you just wouldn't take construction down faster in the markets other than...","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","That is a good point. I think I would argue that's what we are doing. Again, as I point out, there is little optimism in this forecast for construction beyond the typical seasonal improvement in sales here and there as you go through the year. So it is not anticipating an overall increase in \u2013 or boost in industry demand from these current levels. And so I think that is effectively what we've attempted to do is look at it from that perspective.","Rajesh Kalathur - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Eli, this is Raj. To your point, we have not only taken down the market for industry projections for CE, we've also taken down our schedules and our forecast further just to go \u2013 illustrate the points you made that Sam had earlier discussed with all of you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Okay, thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from Henry Kirn from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open.","Henry George Kirn - SG Americas Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone, and I'll echo the congratulations to Susan. In addition to the acquisition that you just made, are there more potential spots where it would be cheaper to buy than build? And under what circumstances would you be willing to meaningfully step up the M&A focus? Thanks.","Rajesh Kalathur - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","This is Raj, Henry. Of course, we are not going to talk about any specific M&A and so on. But I will just tell you a little bit about our approach to M&A. It is more strategic than opportunistic. And we take a long-term perspective with M&A. What I mean is we identify M&A candidates that align with and strengthen our strategy really, and we have discussions with them in some cases multiple years before they become actionable. Downturns like the current one we're in tend to sometimes provide a window of opportunity for some of these long-term discussions to materialize into acquisitions. Monosem and Precision Planting are examples of our approach to M&A. So I am going to leave it at that and not talk more.","Henry George Kirn - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay, right.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. You kept the volume guidance for South America unchanged. Do you have more conviction around that figure now than you did back in November? Or is there still a bit of uncertainty? And maybe you could talk about the order book down there?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Right. I think anytime we talk about the markets really outside of the U.S., for large Ag that South America in particular, the visibility is not as far out. So always remember that versus large Ag in the U.S. and Canada where we do have the best visibility from an order book perspective. So there's certainly, I would say, continued risk in South America and potential opportunity. I would say you have both, so risk \u2013 Brazil continues, while, the farmers in Brazil continue to operate at very profitable levels because of the fact that they do sell their commodities in U.S. dollars, so the FX is benefiting them but the overall government concerns remain.","The FINAME financing there appears to have stabilized somewhat, Moderfrota is back in place and the funding appears to be in place for that as well. We've heard some positive comments from government officials regarding their commitment to that. But, again, there is always risk and remember their fiscal year end in June. And so what happens with the FINAME financing and other supports beyond June would continue to be a question as well. Now, on the flipside, you have Argentina where we would argue there is potential upside opportunity there if the reforms continue to progress and if those reforms are fully implemented such that we have the ability not just to import but also export and so on. We think that could be a really good opportunity for us.","You may have heard when we were out traveling with Sam the fact that it is a very profitable market for us and so the opportunity to sell more products into Argentina would certainly be beneficial for us. So there are a lot of puts and takes as you think about South America but all in all, the industry outlook. Again, remember that's on tractors and combines, remained unchanged and so that's really not much change in our current view what that market may look like.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Okay, next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from Steven Fisher from UBS Securities. Your line is open.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning and best wishes, Susan. How are you guys thinking about the trade-off of price versus market share in small and medium-size Ag equipment? Because from what we hear, it sounds like everyone is trying to pressure everyone else. So as you guys think about it, I mean, does it make sense to incentivize sales to hold on to you market share? Or do you just leave that to your dealers on the strength of your brand and not given on price?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","I think I would say it's a similar strategy that what we've had kind of on an overall basis from a company perspective and that is that balanced approach. Pricing continues to be important to us. We continue to, in most cases, trade at a premium to our competition and certainly we would continue to be focused on price realization in small Ag. Now, where we've really increased our focus is on innovation in that area and we brought in some very attractive product. So in that case, quite often, it's not so much about discounting but making sure you have the right features on that product the customers are willing to pay for, and not having excessive amounts of features that they aren't willing to pay for, if you will. So that tends to be our focus. It's making sure we really understand that market that we're delivering the product that customer is looking for and that we can do that with positive pricing.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley Investment Research. Your line is open.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks and congratulations to Susan. So there's been a few questions on Construction & Forestry already but something I just want a little bit more clarity on is, Sam has said at the breakfast in January that you guys are working through excess inventory levels in the channel. And I guess I'm just curious how much progress you made there during the quarter. And if you would now characterize Construction & Forestry industry levels as healthy or in line with end user demand?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Certainly, as you look at the reported receivables and inventory, you'll note that they're slightly higher year-over-year, so I would say that's still an ongoing focus as we move through the year is to pull those inventory levels down. So if you look at ending inventories, it actually does year-over-year, we would \u2013 with our current forecast, we would finish both inventory and within our factories as well as dealer inventories at or below where \u2013 as a percent of sales where we were at the end of 2015. So still will be a focus. It is not \u2013 we are not finished in that progression, but definitely very focused on making sure that happens.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from Larry De Maria from William Blair & Company. Your line is open.","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning and best of luck to Susan. Can you just update us on where the pooled fund stands this year? I don't know if that's been worked down, or is there much left for dealer to use? And perhaps is that a reason why you're still getting that nice positive pricing and the steady residual values because the dealers are using those funds? So if you could just update us on that. Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah. So pool funds, for those that may not be aware, those are funds that dealers effectively earn when they sell new equipment that they then can utilize for various incentives on used. And certainly, we would say overall, it's \u2013 and I'll tell you, really no change from last quarter. Overall, they're in good shape. Now there are some \u2013 we couldn't say that for every dealer. We have some dealers where we wouldn't be comfortable with the level of pool funds they have relative to the equipment that's on their lots. We are seeing dealers shifting the use of those more towards the retail sale portion. As you may be aware, they can use those funds both to provide low or no interest wholesale funding while that inventory is on their lot, or they can also use it towards various incentives.","I think part of the reason why used pricing is staying high: A), that's historically how Deere equipment has responded in this type of environment; and B), some of those incentives aren't focused on simply reducing the purchase price. So we're looking at things like lower rate financing opportunities, providing additional warranty on the equipment, those sorts of things that provide incentives to the customer without degrading the purchase price, if you will. So again, we did see \u2013 and I want to be clear. When we came into the downturn, we did see some small decreases in used pricing, but they've held very firm at those small single-digit type of declines, at least to date. So we are pleased with that aspect.","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Hi, good morning. I'm just trying to figure out what you're trying to imply about incremental residual value losses in Ag. You highlight the construction higher residual values. But when we look at the comments you made about used, you feel in Ag is holding steady. You're obviously making some assumptions around future issues by raising the loss provision. Can you help us understand? What are you implying about your change from provisions and your used equipment comments on Ag when it comes to \u2013 from here going forward, what is the level of residual value risk within the Ag book?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Right. First of all, you need to separate those two, because provision relates to the retail note portfolio.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","No, I understand. It's a commentary on the health of the end market, where used prices are versus...","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Right, right. but I just want to clarify that, because again, while used equipment prices have held firm from that initial decline, we did see some initial decline. And so when you look at losses on returned leases, keeping in mind the average \u2013 for new equipment, the average lease term is around three years, and used has actually moved to that. It used to be a little bit further out. So most of the lease returns that are coming back today would have been written three years ago, at least on average.","So you're really still in the height of the market. So recoveries aren't as high as what they would have been historically. They're still very, very strong, but we're still seeing a little bit of a decline in the recovery rate on the Ag equipment coming in. But I wouldn't imply anything beyond that. Certainly from a provision increase, a lot of those increases come from things like a revolving credit portfolio, which is where you tend to see some responsiveness early on, not just the Ag portfolio. So those are the things that are really driving those higher level of provisions in the forecast.","The other thing I'd be quick to point out is they're higher but they're higher off of historic, as you know, very low levels and let's just say that forecast is dead on and we hit 19 basis points this year. That's still a very attractive level for any portfolio to be maintaining in this type of an environment with the provision on credit losses. So again, we feel very good about the strength of the farmer and their ability to continue to pay for the equipment they have financed with us.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","I appreciate the answer, Tony, but it doesn't really answer the question. I'm trying to figure out if you feel used prices are now sequentially steady.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Yes.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","If they stay at these levels, let's just say this is it, they're this straightforward. What level of residual value risk or losses are baked into your guidance? Because obviously you highlight the construction side today, and I appreciate that. But the used comment sequentially about pricing was interesting. I'm just trying to help everybody gauge where are we. Clearly, there are as you pointed out not quite the recoveries of the past. Can you help us a bit in framing it?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","I would tell you at this point, what's anticipated in the forecast for Ag is largely inconsequential. Yes, there are some losses in the forecast, but we're not talking about \u2013 especially when you put it relative to the size of that portfolio. You look at those portfolios, Ag or construction as we talk about is more than two-thirds of the impairment charges that we took in the quarter, and the size of the portfolio is significantly smaller. And so again, I think that's the key difference. And I wouldn't extrapolate any of what we're talking about from construction towards Ag. There are significant differences in those portfolios between Ag and construction on our leasing.","So you think about things like the term of the leases. Most of the losses we're seeing and the impairment that we're taking for construction are around short-term leases. We have less than 5% of the Ag operating lease portfolio would be what we deem a short-term lease, 12 months or less, where you've got 22% of production-class equipment leases that would be in that view.","We also lease a lot more used equipment in Ag, which again, in our view would reduce some of that risk. So about 42% of our Ag portfolio is used equipment versus about 14% of construction \u2013 I'm sorry, 3% of construction is used equipment.","And probably the most important difference between those two, similar to what we would talk about from a retail note perspective with the dealer reserve, on our operating leases over half of the Ag operating leases in the U.S. and Canada have some level of dealer guarantee on residual values, which provides obviously protection around any losses on residual value. More importantly, it drives a very engaged dealer in the process when these leases come back \u2013 or when the equipment comes back off of lease. So again, very, very different portfolios and I wouldn't say we're trying to imply anything when we talk about higher provisions or the value of used equipment other than the fact that they're holding steady. And if that continues, our risk on operating leases in Ag are quite low. It's still a risk that we can maintain those used equipment prices but at this point, that is holding up well.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","That's great detail. Thank you very much.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from Mike Shlisky from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. And again, Susan, best of luck. Wanted to ask quickly about Europe. I think you had mentioned that Ag sales were actually up in Europe in the quarter. Either way, I've seen data where you're seeing Deere gain some share in some key markets in Europe. Could you maybe just take us through are there any countries that are doing better for you and any that are doing worse, and any product categories that are doing better or worse? And perhaps is it possible for Deere itself to beat your overall market outlook for the year at all? Thanks.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","As you think about Europe, first, to the second part of that question. We certainly hope so. Any year that we enter, we would hope to gain some market share. We have a lot of new product that's entering the European market. We've been recognized from numerous tradeshows with that innovation, both Agritechnica as well as a number of shows since then that we've received a variety of awards for that innovation. So again, especially in some of those key products we would certainly hope to gain some share of it.","If you think about in the short-term, with Europe, I would note that in the first part of the year that we are getting some benefit from France. They had what's been referred to as a super amortization program which does allow for some additional amortization of the equipment in the early stages of the ownership which is providing some benefit for sales there. And we did see that increase in sales in France. That program is scheduled to end in mid-April and it's based on retail. So those would be tractors that would need to be sold to customers by mid-April and so we are again seeing a bit of advantage from that.","Outside of that, I think, as you think about Europe, there does overall continue to be some headwind there with \u2013 just like a lot of parts of the world with lower commodity prices. Dairy is a significant market for the European farmer and we continue to see pressure there. I think every quarter, we anticipate in the next six months for that to start to moderate and each quarter it keeps getting pushed out. But it seems to be holding on in a stubborn way in terms of the pressure on dairy right now for those farmers. But with that, I'm not sure I can add much more value beyond that. I appreciate the question.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","That's great, Tony. Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs & Company. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning and, Susan, congratulations. Tony, I'm wondering if you could just update us on your warranty performance on Tier 4 products, either frequency of repair, cost of repair? And you took up your accruals last year, I think, as you typically do with new products and can you remind us from an accounting standpoint when can we expect accruals to normalize if the performance remains favorable? How long before you make that accounting change? Thanks.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","So with the warranty related questions? Yeah. Keep in mind, that's part of \u2013 that would fall into our pricing. And so to the extent you have higher returns and allowances that does affect our pricing, so you would see it there in terms of lower-priced realization, I think would be the answer. But generally, to your point, you will occasionally have some issues in a specific quarter where you had to book some accruals on specific products with new equipment. But generally, that's been a favorable trend and helped from a pricing perspective.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And sorry, Tony, the performance on Tier 4 final products, has that been favorable versus expectations and versus the accounting accruals so far?","Rajesh Kalathur - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Jerry, this is Raj. If you look at every new product development program, so every wave effect typically has more issues that come up with it and then it subsides. So if you look at what we have seen in our transitions from Tier 3 and into IT 4 \u2013 into Tier 4, we are very comfortable with what we have seen in terms of the product warranties in R&A with this wave of new product development programs.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","And I did want to clarify my comment. The returns and allowances are in our net sales number. They are not in our pricing calculation. So I misspoke when I said that. So \u2013 but it does impact our net sales.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Okay, thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Emily McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Emily McLaughlin on for Seth today.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Hello.","Emily McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just wondering if you guys could provide a little more color on your lower organic C&F outlook? Just trying to figure out if it's end market demand deteriorating or right sizing of channel inventory.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Lower...","Emily McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then what's your confidence in your ability to maintain the positive C&F pricing with the current demand environment?","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Sure. Yeah, I mean, basically as I mentioned earlier in the call, it's primarily the lower sales forecast for Construction & Forestry is around U.S. and Canada and so we lowered our end market outlook for sales in the U.S. and Canada. And again, a lot of that is just as oil prices have remained very low, the pressure that's putting on the overall market continues. And so much of the optimism we had of the markets improving as we go into the back half of the year were pretty much removed out of the forecast. So again, we continue to forecast positive price and that's our best estimate at this point and probably can't say much more beyond that. So we have time for one more caller.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will be coming from the line of Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is open.","Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So, Tony, can you maybe just talk about the margin assumption changes for each segment for 2016, and also where your large Ag utilization rates are currently? Thank you.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","Again, when you think about large Ag utilization, we talked about last year it does vary by \u2013 or last quarter, it does vary by product. So certainly when you think about where we are as a percent of mid-cycle in those products, you'd be at 50% or less in some of those facilities. And so that's where we continue to operate. And I would say mostly as you think about changes in the margin outlook, obviously FX is impacting that and that's probably the biggest change from last quarter on the Ag part. So very \u2013 really very little from a volume perspective in terms of the changes from original budget. Certainly for the year, volumes would have an impact.","Tony Huegel - Director-Investor Relations","So with that, I think we will need to conclude the call. We do appreciate you calling in and the questions, and as always, we will be around to take questions throughout the day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."],"7375":["Deere & Co.

Thank you. You may begin.","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Hello. Also on the call today are Raj Kalathur, our Chief Financial Officer; Ryan Campbell, Vice President and Corporate Controller and Brent Norwood, Manager, Investor Communications.","Today, we'll take a closer look at Deere's first quarter earnings, and then spend some time talking about our markets, and our current outlook for fiscal 2018. After that, we'll respond to your questions.","Please note that slides are available to complement the call this morning. They can be accessed at our website at www.johndeere.com\/earnings.","First, a reminder.

Additional information concerning these measures including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures is included in the release and posted on our website at www.johndeere.com\/earnings under Quarterly Earnings & Events. Brent?","Brent Norwood - Deere & Co.","With the announcement of our first quarter earnings, John Deere has started out 2018 on a positive note. Net income for the quarter was affected by upfront charges from U.S. tax reform legislation, which we believe will reduce the company's overall tax rate, and be beneficial in the future. Backing out this legislative change, adjusted earnings were $430 million, on sharply higher sales. We have increased our 2018 sales and adjusted net income forecast as a result of our confidence in present market conditions, and in our ability to fulfill customer demand.","Now, let's take a closer look at our first quarter results in detail, beginning on slide 3. Net sales and revenues were up 23% to $6.9 billion. For the quarter, Deere reported a net loss of $535 million or $1.66 per share.","During this period, the company incurred charges of $965 million related to recent U.S. tax reform legislation. Excluding this charge, adjusted net income was $430 million or $1.31 per share. The charges included an estimated one-time write-down of net deferred tax assets totaling $715 million.","Additionally, Deere incurred an estimated one-time charge of $262 million on the repatriation of foreign earnings, will which likely be paid out over the next eight years. Both charges were partially offset by a favorable reduction in the annual effective tax rate of $12 million.","On slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 27% to $5.974 billion. Currency translation was positive by 3 points. The impact of acquisitions was 5 points.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses; starting with Agriculture & Turf on slide 5. Net sales were up 18% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, primarily driven by higher shipment volumes and the favorable effect of currency translation. For the quarter, Deere experienced increased demand across key markets, though sales gains were moderated by supply chain and logistic challenges. Progress is already being made to address these issues, and our suppliers and factories expect to catch up over the course of the year.","Operating profit was $387 million, up 78% from $218 million last year. The increase was a result of higher shipment volumes and lower warranty expenses, partially offset by higher production costs. Last year's results included a gain on the sale of SiteOne and costs associated with a voluntary employee-separation program.","Ag & Turf operating margins were 9.1% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of one-time adjustments, such as the SiteOne gain and the voluntary employee-separation program expenses, incremental margins were 32%, compared with the first quarter of 2017.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the Ag business. On slide 6, despite increasing demand, global grain and oil seed stocks-to-use ratios are forecast to remain at elevated levels in 2017-2018, as abundant crops have offset strong demand around the world. Corn, soybeans and stock-to-use ratios are expected to decline in 2017-2018 as global demand outpaces production. Conversely, wheat stock-to-use ratio continues to increase to its highest level in almost two decades.","Slide 7 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. 2018 farm cash receipts are estimated to be $372 billion, approximately 1% lower than 2017. Crop cash receipts are projected to decline modestly, as gains from oil crops are offset by declines in feed crops. Receipts from livestock are expected to remain roughly flat year-over-year, with higher quantities compensating for price declines.","Lastly, government payments represent the largest year-over-year decline, owing to lower guarantee prices in 2018. Our Ag economic outlook for the EU28 is on slide 8. GDP is expected to grow moderately for the year, though non-economic and geopolitical risks remain elevated. While overall arable farm margins remain slightly below long-term averages, conditions differ by region with some areas, such as Northwest Europe, showing signs of improvement in 2018.","Margins for the dairy segment remain above long-term averages, though rising production may pressure prices throughout the year. Sentiment remains positive for beef producers. However, pork prices are weakening due to rising supplies.","Shifting to Brazil on slide 9. The chart on the left displays the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness in Brazil. Ag production is expected to decrease about 2% in 2018 in U.S. dollar terms, due to record production in 2017 and a revision to trend yields in 2018.","In local currency, the value of production is forecast to be down about 1%. On the right side of the slide, you will see the eligible rates for Ag-related government sponsored finance programs. While rates for Moderfrota remain at 7.5% for small and midsized farmers and 10.5% for large farmers, the grace period for financing was extended to 14 months in December. This allows growers to capture two harvest seasons before making equipment payments. This enhancement to financing terms demonstrates the government's ongoing commitment to agriculture and is driving continued improvement in farmer confidence.","Our 2018 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on slide 10. Industry sales in the U.S. and in Canada are forecast to be up approximately 10% for the year. Despite range down commodity prices, the industry is experiencing stronger replacement demand for large equipment, as customers express their equipment demand in terms of need versus want. Replacement demand is reflected in the results of our Combine Early Order Program, which ended up in double-digits from last year, and in the large tractor order book, which continues to run ahead of last year.","The EU28 industry outlook is forecast to be up about 5% in 2018 as a result of above-average margins in dairy and livestock, as well as improved outlooks in key markets such as France and the UK.","In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be flat to up 5% for the year. This is being driven mainly by demand in Argentina, which continues to benefit from favorable policy effects, strong fundamentals and pent-up demand. Shifting to Asia, sales are expected to be relatively unchanged from 2017.","Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2018. Deere expects to outpace the industry as a result of new product introductions.","Putting this all together on slide 11, fiscal year 2018 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be up approximately 15%, including about 3 points of positive currency translation. The Ag & Turf division's operating margin is forecast to be about 13.5% for the year, up roughly 1 point from 2017. This implies incremental margins of just under 35%, excluding the impact for one-time adjustments such as the sale of SiteOne, the voluntary employee-separation program, and the acquisition of Blue River Technology.","Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on slide 12. Net sales were up 57% compared to the first quarter in 2017, primarily driven by strong demand for Construction & Forestry equipment, as well as by the acquisition of Wirtgen, which closed on December 1 of last year.","Operating profit was $32 million, which included an operating loss for Wirtgen of $92 million. The loss was attributable to the unfavorable effects of purchase accounting and acquisition costs. C&F operating margins were 1.8% for the quarter, but 8.4% excluding Wirtgen.","Moving to slide 13, the economic indicators affecting the Construction & Forestry industries continue to be supportive of equipment demand. GDP growth is forecast to be solid, continuing the positive trend seen in the U.S. and Canada through much of 2017.","Housing demand is growing, but sales remain constrained by supply due to 35-year low inventories for new and existing single-family homes. Along with growing wages and job growth, these factors underpin our outlook for growing housing starts.","Single-family housing starts are strong across all regions in the U.S. Single-family homes require extensive earthmoving and lumber content, which are important drivers of earthmoving and forestry equipment. In 2018, construction investment is forecast to grow 2.2%, up from the previous forecast of 1.4%. The increase is being led by oil and gas and residential activity.","Oil prices are forecast to average above $58 a barrel for the year. That's important because oil and gas related construction activity tends to slow when oil prices are below $50, but picks up when prices are above that level. In addition, machinery rental utilization rates continue improving and rental pricing continues to gain positive traction. Deere's outlook is also reflected in a strong order book and positive trends in retail sales.","Moving to the C&F outlook on slide 14. Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be up about 80% in 2018 as a result of stronger demand for equipment, as well as the acquisition of Wirtgen. The revenue forecast includes about $3.2 billion in sales attributable to the acquisition. The forecast for global forestry markets is up about 5% as a result of improvement in sales in the U.S. and Canada, and strong demand for cut-to-length products in Europe.","C&F's full-year operating margin is now projected to be about 7.5%, which includes the negative impact of purchase accounting and acquisition costs from Wirtgen. Excluding Wirtgen, C&F projects margins to be approximately 11%, which is up from our previous guidance of 10.5%.","For the full year in 2018, Wirtgen is expected to be operating profit neutral, as purchase accounting and acquisition expenses completely offset operating profit for the year. On a standalone basis, Wirtgen is forecast to deliver operating margins between 15% and 16% in 2018. Beyond 2018, operating margins are estimated in the 12% to 13% range, including purchase accounting adjustments.","Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 15 shows the provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average owned portfolio. At the end of January, the annualized provision for credit losses was 2 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecasts for 2018 shown on the slide contemplates a loss provision of about 22 basis points, 3 basis points lower than our previous forecast. This would put loss provisions for the year just below the 10-year average of 25 basis points and the 15-year average of 27 points.","Moving to slide 16, Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $425 million in the first quarter versus $114 million last year. For the full year in 2018, net income is forecast to be about $840 million, up from the previous forecast. The higher results for the quarter and the higher full year forecast are primarily due to a benefit from the recent U.S. tax reform legislation, and to a lesser extent, a higher average portfolio and lower losses on leases. Beyond 2018, effective tax rates for John Deere Financial are forecast to be between 24% and 26%.","Slide 17 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter up $4.1 billion. About $350 million of the change relates to currency translation. In the C&F division, the increase is largely attributable to Wirtgen, while for Ag, the increase is due to higher sales as well as pipeline replenishment. By the end of fiscal year 2018, receivables and inventories are expected to increase about $1.7 billion from 2017 levels, driven by the inclusion of Wirtgen as well as the higher sales across the company.","Slide 18 shows cost of sales as a percentage of net sales. Cost of sales for the first quarter was 78.8%. Our 2018 cost of sales guidance is about 75% of net sales, unchanged from our previous guidance. When modeling 2018, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: higher production costs and higher incentive compensation costs. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point, and a more positive product mix.","Now, let's look at some additional details. With respect to R&D expense on slide 19, R&D was up approximately 14% in the first quarter. Currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 2 points, while another 5 points related to the acquisitions of Wirtgen and Blue River Technology.","Our 2018 forecast calls for R&D to be up about 20%, with acquisition-related activities accounting for 9 points of the increase, and currency translation for 1 point. The balance of the R&D increase relates to strategic investments in large Ag and precision Ag that help drive growth for these key areas.","Moving now to slide 20, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up 8% in the first quarter, with acquisition-related activities, the voluntary employee-separation program and currency translation accounting for most of the change. Our 2018 forecast for SA&G expense is up approximately 23%. Excluding acquisition-related expenses, SA&G is forecast to be up about 2% in 2018.","Turning to slide 21, the equipment operations tax rate was 422% in the first quarter, primarily due to the impact of recent U.S. tax reform legislation, as noted earlier. For the remainder of the year, the effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 25% to 27%, which implies a full year effective tax rate of approximately 62%. Beyond fiscal year 2018, Deere's effective tax rate is projected to be between 25% and 27%. On a long-term basis, recent tax reform legislation is expected to be beneficial to Deere's financial outlook.","Slide 22 shows our equipment operations' history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from equipment operations is now forecast to be about $4.4 billion in 2018. The company's financial outlook is on slide 23. Second quarter equipment sales are forecast to be up 30% to 40% over last year. Our full-year outlook now calls for net sales to be up about 29%, which includes about 1 point of price realization.","Finally, our full year 2018 net income forecast is now about $2.1 billion. Excluding the effect of U.S. tax reform legislation, adjusted net income is forecast to be about $2.85 billion using a 29.5% tax rate, which assumes no tax reform impact.","I will now turn the call over to Raj Kalathur for closing comments. Raj?","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","Thanks, Brent. Before we respond to your questions, let me share a few thoughts on the first quarter and our expectations for the rest of the year.","First, it's noteworthy that Deere closed the Wirtgen deal on December 1, representing the largest transaction in Deere's 181 year history. Wirtgen has continued to perform in line with expectations since the purchase agreement was signed in May of last year.","Our teams are making good progress on the integration front, and are working on synergy opportunities in the areas of sales, cost reduction and technology. We're maintaining a positive outlook for the year as the underlying fundamentals continue to be strong, and Wirtgen's global order book showed a double-digit increase over 2017. Though Wirtgen probably won't contribute to Deere's reported profits in 2018, due mainly to the effects of purchase accounting, it will make a meaningful cash contribution to our results over the course of the year.","Second, as the agricultural equipment cycle improves, it is being helped by a reduction in used equipment inventories, and by the impact of replacement demand, driven by customer need for new equipment. Deere's Ag & Turf business is benefiting from this situation, and is on track to deliver incremental margins in the 30-plus percent range for the year.","Now, this type of financial performance is particularly impressive, considering the headwinds of material cost inflation and increased investments in R&D that we are planning. Regarding our ability to meet demand, we are working closely with our suppliers and logistics providers as they adjust to present conditions. We remain confident in our ability to fulfill customer demand over the course of the year.","That confidence is reflected in our increased financial guidance. As noted, we've raised our sales forecast by 7 points to up 29%, our adjusted net income forecast has been raised to $2.85 billion, versus $2.6 billion previously.","As a final note, we are encouraged by the improving outlook for equipment demand across our businesses, and look forward to delivering continued strong performance in 2018 and beyond.","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Now we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. Remember in consideration of others and our desire to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today is from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","Good morning, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Raj, can you just build our confidence on the ability to ramp up with the supply chain. Clearly with the guidance increase you feel like there's been progress made over the past couple of months, maybe just give us some granularity in terms of how many key components you're monitoring today versus a couple of months ago? And just give us some context in terms of how broad-based were the supply chain issues you mentioned, and just more context on what's improving there would be great?","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","Yeah. Jerry, the underlying issues are related to availability of labor and freight that you probably read about in the media in general, okay. So if you think about the types of components that have been impacted, these are wiring harnesses where there's a lot of labor required, and any such interruptions essentially with time, it gets better.","If you think about where we are coming from, from the lower levels of volumes we've had in 2016 to up in a single-digit range. And now we're ramping up even further in the high-teens for our core business. That takes a while \u2013 a lot of suppliers have the physical capacity, it takes time for them to actually put the people in place and get them trained and have them working in a synchronized fashion.","So it's just a matter of time, and as we know from the past, this takes a little bit of time. That's why we said, we were confident enough to increase our full-year forecast, knowing fully well that this is going to be addressed over the second quarter and third quarter. Josh?","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And so it sounds like the second quarter, just to be clear, Raj, the second quarter, you folks laid out a pretty wide range. So it sounds like based on your comment, though, you're confident that the performance improves in the second quarter?","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","So, Jerry, most \u2013 yeah the performance improves substantially in the second quarter. I'm going to say, most of the catching up will be done, and we are also having a substantial increase in the second quarter. All of those will be met, but there will be some elements that will go into the third quarter, okay?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Jerry, what I'd add there is, there is significant amount of prioritization done there as you got seasonal products that are more important to get out in Q2. So where we've been able to, we've flattened our production schedule to accommodate this demand. And as Raj said, confident in our execution over the course of the year.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Timothy Thein from Citi Research.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Maybe, Raj, just your updated thoughts in terms of capital allocation. And specifically, as it relates to the dividend, that the current rate of $2.40 (00:25:01), it basically implies like an $8 number based on your payout targets, and yet, you're on pace to generate earnings more than 10% higher than that. So maybe just an update specifically as it relates to the dividend, and then maybe capital allocation update more broadly? Thank you.","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","Okay. So thanks, Tim. Now, let me go overall. Our cash flow from operations this year is going to be about $4.4 billion, and this clearly brings your question in front. Now, first, as we have said before, our focus in the first quarter was to meet all the requirements for a smooth Wirtgen transaction. The first quarter is also usually when our working capital cash requirements are the highest. Now that we have managed through 1Q requirements, we can look at the next steps.","And next, we've also talked about \u2013 we'll look at opportunities from U.S. tax reform. So we have time until we file our 2017 taxes, which will be due in late July or early August of 2018, to contribute to our pension plans and get a 35% deduction. While we do not have any current requirement for pension contributions, as our plans are well-funded, we're looking at this opportunistically, and may consider some contributions in fiscal 2018.","Beyond that, you're right. Our cash use priorities remain the same, the mid-single A (00:26:29), which we think are some very good stead (00:26:32), our growth investments, then dividends and repurchases. With respect to dividends, Tim, to your question, we try to keep our dividends between 25%, 35% of mid-cycle earnings. And if you include the cash earnings from Wirtgen, yeah, we will be below the 25% level. So this will receive considerable attentions in the next few quarters from us.","So from a share repurchase standpoint, and as we've said before, it's an essential use of cash and we are keen to ensure that we are adding value to our longer-term-minded investors with any share repurchases. So on dividends, again, yeah, it's something that we will be looking at very closely in the next couple of quarters.","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Thanks. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research Partners.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning. Could you talk about your views just on Construction & Forestry cycle? When we look at underlying legacy business ex-Wirtgen, setting up for a very strong year in 2018. Just how you're thinking about that relative to where we've come from, and then moving beyond that, and whether some of the restocking this year push \u2013 pulls forward a little bit extra demand?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Yeah, Joe. When you think about C&F, I mean, obviously, the underlying conditions continue to be very strong. We're seeing that activity in our dealerships. We're seeing it with the rental business, and what we look to rental utilization, which continues to be strong. And really when you step back and look at that inventory and receivable build in the C&F business, that's largely Wirtgen, there's a small amount that is C&F-related.","So we're really \u2013 from a field inventory perspective, stepping up a little bit, but that's really coming off of what have been decade-long lows of field inventories. Those were drawn down pretty aggressively in 2016 and then again in 2017. But I think as we look at the industry overall, continued strong demand across multiple segments, not just oil and gas, but also in the non-energy-producing regions. They continue to be attractive and driving investment in the business.","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","Hey, Joe. I will add a couple of statistics for your benefit. If you look at the orders you've gotten for the first 13 weeks of this fiscal year, it's about 40% higher than the same 13 weeks last year. And our order bank would be almost double; it actually is more than double where we were at this point last year. So very strong order book and order bank, and very strong end market demand for these products.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Raso from Evercore ISI.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Hi, good morning. Just trying to reconcile, now we have the margin guide for the segments, you're basically implying your segment operating profit is up about $1.1 billion year-over-year but you're implying your net income is only up $700 million. So I'm trying to reconcile that gap, right? Maybe $100 million is from higher interest expense, but that's still about $1 billion on EBIT but only $700 million on net income. Even if you tax affect it, we're still off here by a couple hundred million dollars, $0.60, $0.70 of earnings on the implied EPS. So can you reconcile that gap? Why is that gap so wide all of a sudden between your EBIT growth and your net income growth?","Ryan D. Campbell - Deere & Co.","Hey, David, it's Ryan. And a couple things I'd ask you to think about it. One, it's early in the year, and given all the challenges that we faced, and while we still feel confident that we'll be able to work through that, we're seeing some inflation headwinds and other things that are coming at us.","And so, as we thought about $2.85 billion as the pro forma net income number, we're contemplating all of those things in there. So you might not be able to perfectly reconcile everything, but at this point in the year, given where we are and given all the things that we're seeing in the marketplace, $2.85 billion is the number that we're comfortable with.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","No, I appreciate that, but I mean, you're not reflecting that in the segment guide. I mean, basically it looks like you're putting about 50 bps of cushion in your net income number of margin that you're not putting in the segment margin, right? So I'm just \u2013 so that's all basically is \u2013 there's, look, you have your thoughts on the segments and you kind of gave a little more of a conservative, how that rolls back down to the net income, is that a fair...?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","David, I'd say that's fair.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Okay. And lastly, real quick \u2013 sorry to bug you on this, but Wirtgen, what you're giving for second quarter sales guide and what you did in the first quarter guide, it implies a slowdown in the second half, like, basically you're saying second quarter is $1.16 billion on revenue. We know we have the first quarter now, so that all of a sudden the back-half is only run-rating like $840 million, $850 million a quarter in revenue, a big step-down from 2Q. Anything to be thoughtful on about that or is that just you wanted to keep the full year Wirtgen rev guide just sort of where it was and we'll update it later?","Ryan D. Campbell - Deere & Co.","Yeah, so we kept the full year Wirtgen. And keep in mind that for this quarter, it was only one month of Wirtgen activity, and so we're forecasting 10 months this year of Wirtgen activity. And so we really only have one month. I would say that their business, they do have a little bit of seasonality in their business starting in the beginning of the calendar year over the next few months. But essentially, there's nothing really to read into that. We've kept Wirtgen consistent ex-currency and purchase accounting, and just keep in mind, we've got 10 months this year.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","No, I hear, it's just the second quarter at $1.16 billion, all of a sudden dropping down. That's all I was asking. Okay, really appreciate it. Thank you.","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Hey, thanks, David.","Ryan D. Campbell - Deere & Co.","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning. A clarification, and then just a question. Just to be clear, your net income guidance of $2.850 billion does not assume the lower tax rate in the remaining years. So is the real net income guide $3.065 billion, and why aren't we assuming the lower tax rate in the remaining quarters? And then just my second question, is there any way you can quantify how much the supply chain issues or production issues impacted the first quarter, and what's implied for the rest of the year? Thank you.","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Yeah, Jamie, when you think about the tax rate, that $2.85 billion contemplates the 29.5%. So you're right in that the rest of your forecast is in that 25% to 27% range.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. But why aren't we assuming the 25% to...","Ryan D. Campbell - Deere & Co.","Yeah, Jamie, it's Ryan. What we tried to do with the pro forma is keep it somewhat pure to kind of how we would have looked at the business if tax reform never happened. So that produced the 29.5% that we calculated the pro forma with, with we came at 32% and there's been some discretes that have come through that now we're thinking of 29.5%. Certainly, as tax reform comes through, we're going to get a lower rate over time, and you can see in the slides where we're forecasting the lower rate.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Okay. Yeah, and then just a second question on the supply chain, like \u2013 can you quantify the impact to the quarter? What's implied in the remaining two quarters, I guess?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Not a clear quantification, Jamie. But obviously you see what \u2013 from our guidance perspective, what we expected to do on the top line in 1Q versus where we ended up. That's really the driver of that miss. And then, as you look forward to the raise overall in terms of our sales, that's not \u2013 it includes obviously the catch-up as well as what we're seeing from additional demand.","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","So, Jamie, as Josh mentioned, we guided 38% in 1Q and ended up 27%. Think of all of it \u2013 almost all of it as (00:34:46) supply chain, because the end market demand is actually growing on us, not the other way around.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And just to be clear, I'm assuming the supply chain issues were all Ag, right?","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","It was on both sides.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Both sides. Was one more concentrated versus the other?","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","I would say, you think of it as where would logistics make a bigger difference, where would labor availability make a bigger difference on a supply base. You have to think about the type of supplier more than our segments with respect to where the impact was.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you. I'll follow-up offline.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Nicole Deblase from Deutsche Bank.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, guys. Good morning. So forgive me if I'm just like \u2013 I'm completely confused by the way you guys are doing net income guidance versus the tax rate issues. So the pro forma 29.5% does not include any impact of U.S. tax reform, correct? So your full-year guidance, the $2.85 billion essentially that increase that you had versus the $2.6 billion is coming completely from operations? Is that fair?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Operations, and just a little bit of tax, because in the original opening budget guidance, we guided to about a 32% tax rate based on some discretes that have happened that would have happened irrespective of tax reform, the number's 29.5%.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for clarifying that. And then, I guess, Wirtgen, you guys increased the ongoing operation margin guidance. I think before you were saying 11% to 12%. And now you're saying 12% to 13%. So what's driving that? Is that higher synergies over time? Is it just that the underlying business is better than you expected? Why is it higher?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Yeah, we haven't baked in any synergies right now, although we're certainly confident that we're going to get them. That's purely purchase accounting. And so, what you saw, Wirtgen for this year has a little bit of higher purchase accounting driven by increased step-up than what we expected to inventory. Then that step-up increase in inventory which comes through the P&L this year, there's lower step-up related to amortization of intangibles. So you see that on an ongoing run rate, that that amortization is lower. So that's the only difference that you're seeing there.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thanks. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. My question is around, maybe you could talk about the impact of tax changes both to your own businesses as well as to maybe the way dealers will operate and farmers will operate. Particularly I'm thinking about the changes around the like-for-like assets and what that might do to purchasing patterns in the field?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Yeah, Ann, obviously from a company perspective, long-term this is beneficial. There are charges here that occur in year one, but long-term from a Deere perspective, favorable. As we think about customers, each individual customer and their situation is different. We'd say by and large, this has been viewed favorably as we've talked to customers. But every situation varies and I'd say, from a dealer perspective it's very much the same.","As you get into some of the details, whether it's like kind exchanges or 100% expensing, there are puts and takes. And really varies on how their business is set up, and how they operate. So it's really hard to kind of broad-brush that with \u2013 what does this mean for all customers or all dealers. But generally, the feedback we've gotten so far is positive.","And I'd point out, there's still revisions and components of this tax bill that are being written or contemplated changes, Section 199 is an example. And as those play out, we'll have a better feel, but right now, we feel like generally positive.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And I think...","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","Ann, with respect to \u2013 just adding to what Josh said, you think about the improvements in Section 179, that was good for the customers broadly. Your point about like-kind exchange, but that's offset by 100% expensing, that's a positive for the customers, overall. Other positives, like estate taxes, Ann, if Section 199A stays as is; yeah, that could be a huge positive in terms of additional cash for our customers in the U.S. So you're all with me \u2013 as long as the customers have more cash that we think is beneficial to our business long-term. So generally, we see this as positive (00:39:38).","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Would you expect any changes in how purchasing decisions are made, maybe more purchases, less leasing? Would that be a potential outcome? And then I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Yeah. We think there could be a drive to more purchasing as there are more known benefits of purchasing, whereas in the past few years there's uncertainty as to the tax benefit of purchasing, particularly when Section 179, for example, was not being extended or it was an annual basis. Thanks, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","We'll go ahead and go for the next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the R&D expense as a percent of sales. It went up a couple of points. You mentioned the large Ag and precision Ag projects. Was that all of it? Or was there something else in there?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","No. That's right, Andy. Really, the change there is related to some additional investments in R&D, and really focused, as Brent pointed out, in precision Ag and large Ag, which we feel like are important as we think about looking forward to not only gain share, but also drive margins.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then on the inventory and accounts receivable outlook for Ag & Turf, you had a big build in the quarter, you explained that. Now, you're also looking for $50 million reduction for the year despite the strengthening markets. How should we view that $50 million reduction? Is that just, you had pipeline fill at the end of the year in 2017 carried through into Q1 and you expect to normalize? Or how should we look at that?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Yeah. I think, we view it as really finishing relatively flat for the year. And one thing to think about too at this point, we have less visibility out as we go further through the year, and we start to do our spring seasonal EOPs and that kind of thing for our spring products, that's when we have a lot more visibility into how that looks as you go 4Q into 1Q of the following year.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research.","Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC","Hi, good morning. Could you please just talk a bit about Combine (00:42:09) Early Order Program, et cetera? And then, I wonder if you could comment on whether there's, outside of Turf, any market share gains built into your forecast?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Yeah. As you think about the Combine EOP, it did come in strong, so up double-digits, and that was on the back of what we saw, up double-digits on our spring seasonal products. So I think, continued strength there, and then you see that build in our forecast from our net sales increase.","And really, what we're seeing there is \u2013 and it was mentioned earlier, but replacement demand in the way that we're \u2013 customers are talking about replacement demand and what's driving that. That's been a big question; what is driving replacement demand. We're seeing that come through really a few different areas; wanting and feeling the need to upgrade technology, getting improved productivity, and be able to hit shorter, whether it's planting, spraying, or harvest windows, the warranty period and really staying within their warranty or their extended warranty and really just overall comfort level with kind of where their machine's at.","And I think as we've talked to dealers, as they've done kind of winter off-season refurbishments, they've noted that this equipment has put more age on. The further we get from those \u2013 further away we get from those years of 2011, 2012, 2013, there's putting a lot more wear and tear and hours on that equipment. So I think that's what's kind of manifesting itself here in some of this improved replacement demand.","And then, outside of the EOPs, our large tractor order book year-over-year, we're out. We're further ahead than we would have been last year on a higher schedule. So for example, if you look at 8R tractors, we're out six weeks further than we would have been last year. 9R tractors, both wheel for 8R wheel and 9R wheel, would be out four weeks. So we've got quite a bit of strength there that we're seeing as a result of that.","Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC","Great. That's very helpful. I'll follow-up offline on the other. Thanks.","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. I'm just kind of thinking conceptually here, I guess, you raised your top line organic guidance by about 5 points, but you kind of left the cost of goods sold flat in that scenario. And does that just reflect sort of the increased material costs and the increases in incentive comp? Or how should I think about that?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Yeah, I think that's fair. You do have \u2013 as we talked about, mentioned earlier, we've seen some favorable mix, which has been positive, but then you do have the rising material costs as well as some freight costs that are impacting that, and then to a lesser extent, incentive comp as well. So I think, the way you lay that out is fair.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then, I'm sorry, I'm just struggling with this tax thing relative to what you're forecasting. Does the model that you're giving us assume the 25% to 27% in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q?","Ryan D. Campbell - Deere & Co.","No. It does not. This is Ryan, it doesn't. So the model that we have that produces the $2.85 billion is based on the 29.5% full year, as if tax had not happened.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","All right. But it did happen, and so it's going to be in the 25% to 27%...","Ryan D. Campbell - Deere & Co.","Correct. That's right. So you could take \u2013 I mean, if you were kind of thinking through what that would mean, take the 29.5% and put it down to the 25% to 27% range, and then you'd get kind of the ongoing impact of that.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","All right. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Shlisky from Seaport Global.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. It seems super-important that you get these issues with your logistics solved, like right now, to kind of meet your sprayer and planter and other equipment shipments for the very early spring.","Can you kind of bucket for us maybe how far along are you inning-wise in getting these issues resolved? And is there any risk of cancellations of orders that might not come back this year if you don't have things to the kind of dealer and farmer on time?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Yeah, I think, at this point, Mike, we feel confident that we'll be able to meet this demand over the course of the year. And again, to your point on time-sensitive things, that's where we're really focused on prioritizing and making sure those seasonal products, spring seasonal products, for example, that they take priority over other things, that their season is further out. So I think, that's the focus, and I would say we've been obviously working on that throughout the course of the first quarter and continue to obviously place a lot of time and resources to working through that.","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","Mike, this is something that's impacting the industry broadly and not just us. So that's something to factor in as well as you think about the demand, lost sales, et cetera., so.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fisher from UBS.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Within the 15% sales growth forecast that you have for the Ag business at Deere, what assumptions do you have for small and medium-duty Ag versus the large Ag? And last quarter, you thought you were about 90% of mid-cycle overall with obviously a much earlier position in the large Ag. But it sounds like large Ag is now advancing more. So where do you think that metric falls out as you contemplate the end of 2018?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Yeah, maybe starting at \u2013 kind of the latter part there. When we think about where we are from a (00:48:25) ops perspective, we'd say we're closer, much closer to that mid-cycle number than we were a quarter ago. Obviously, you've got the Construction side above that, and on the Ag side slightly below there.","So I think that's \u2013 we're continuing to see strength, continued strength in the small Ag business, which has really been strong for the last few years and, as you mentioned, starting to see large Ag grow, and when you think about that, kind of in that framework, you still have large Ag in North America well below mid-cycle and really much closer to our lower ends of what we would consider the trough side. So lots of potential upside there as we come off very low levels.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","But just to clarify, within the 15%, do you have anything assumed to be declining, like either on the smaller or medium duty side?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","No, we would see growth across all of those categories.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","So most of the regions, as we have shown in our forecast, are either flat or up and with respect to small Ag and large Ag, they're both up. And as Josh mentioned, you take large Ag on a worldwide basis, we are still well below what we would say mid-cycle. If you take just large Ag in North America, and it's close to the trough that we talk about; and when we say trough, 80%, 100%, 120% (00:50:08), it's closer to the trough, in terms of large Ag North America.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mig Dobre from Baird.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. Good morning. So to a couple of questions earlier you basically said you pretty much assumed some conservatism below operating income versus what you've guided as segment. Obviously, on your tax rate, you're assuming that 29.5% rather than the actual rate.","When I'm looking at the divergence between what you're guiding for operating cash, you're raising that by $600 million. Your net income is raised by $250 million. What I'm trying to understand is, does that operating cash flow assumption in guidance embed those two other elements of conservatism or is there something else that we need to be aware of here? What's the divergence, $600 million versus the $250 million?","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","Yeah, let me clarify in terms of how we get to the cash flow; that might help you here. So if you look at our cash from operations last year, it was about $2.4 billion. This year we are saying it's going to be about $4.4 billion for the full year 2018. So the biggest component of course is the increase in net income on an adjusted basis, the pro forma, that's about $650 million from last year to this year. And then you have $300 million in additional dividend from John Deere Financial this year due to tax reform, okay? And there's another $300 million on a pre-tax basis, there was an OPEB contribution that we made at the end of 2017 fiscal year, and then there's about $200 million that was from SiteOne impact on net income last year that's not in income this year. So that actually is a better income this year than last year. And then, we also have included in it about $300 million in cash from Wirtgen, which is not in the net income numbers, okay?","So that gives you an idea of how we go from the $2.4 billion to $4.4 billion. I think the same \u2013 the 50\/50 forecast we have should apply on both sides, income and cash flow.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Right, Raj. But I'm just talking about the adjustment to your previously-provided guidance for the year, the $400 million change. That's what I'm interested in.","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","Yeah. That would be the net income increase and the additional dividend from John Deere Financial this year due to the tax reform. So those would be the two components and just the increase from our previous guidance to now.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joel Tiss from BMO.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I made it. How's it going, guys? Just can you talk quickly about your Ag, your maybe large Ag shipments in North America versus the retail demand, how that shapes out for 2018?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Yeah. Joel, we're producing in line with retail demand on the large Ag side by and large, so no departure from kind of where we've been, where we ended 2017, producing that in line with demand, which is where we want to be, and continue to be able to run at pretty lean field inventory levels.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. And then on Wirtgen, can you just give us the early read, purchasing synergies, sharing the footprint across their distribution and your existing, and ability to move product into your existing dealerships, and different things like that that can kind of help us understand behind the scenes some of the opportunities you might have longer-term?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Yeah. I think right now when we look at that, we'd obviously \u2013 and as we commented on earlier, and Raj made the comment that \u2013 still early, but feel good about the synergies from a cost perspective and technology, and then, definitely do see opportunities from a sales side, and really identifying those. I think the approach there is going to be much more of a pull. And when I say that, I mean the Wirtgen sales organization pulling the Deere product that is the best fit for them and their customers into their channels, and not a push of \u2013 here's our entire portfolio, take all of that now.","Rajesh Kalathur - Deere & Co.","And Joel, to add to what Josh just said, we've said \u20ac100 million in synergies over five years and a lot \u2013 90% of that was from the cost side. We are still focused on that and confident we'll deliver that.","Now, we're getting even more excited about some of the opportunities on the sales side, given Wirtgen organization's pulling some of these synergies now. For example, in Mexico City, Wirtgen had a \u2013 it goes both ways there. In Mexico City, for example, Wirtgen had a dealer and that's now possibly going to be our C&F dealer, too. In West Virginia, where they had a \u2013 Wirtgen actually had a gap in their territory, we have a very strong dealer, that dealer is going to take on the Wirtgen contract as well.","So the sales side is seeing some more momentum than we had. And the technology side is another one that's \u2013 some of the technologies we bring, especially on the ISG side, the engineers in the working site feel \u2013 have very good potential, and they're pulling some of those type of synergies. Thank you for the question.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Good morning.","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Good morning.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I wanted to ask you about pricing. I think the first quarter was expected to be up 2 points, I think it came in around flat. Is there anything you'd kind of highlight there? And then, your full-year guidance for up 1%, does that include positive pricing in both segments? Thank you.","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Yeah. So when we say about pricing, you're right. We had forecast about 2 points, we came in about flat in the first quarter. And some of that is just timing quarter-over-quarter and how this plays out. I think, importantly, as we think about the price, the full year remains at 1 point.","I think, what we've seen impact us is, as we compensate our dealers based on their performance and their market share and strong market share gains in 2017, when we reflect that into our plans for 2018, we've seen that move up and that has played an impact. But overall, we'd say that's really a positive thing, because we're driving share gain.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then, just for the full-year guide, do you expect both segments to be positive?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","So what I would say is, we're still seeing a very competitive environment in C&F and have not necessarily seen those pressures alleviate over the last quarter; still a very challenging market from that perspective.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Stanley Elliott from Stifel.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Thank you, guys, for fitting me in. A quick question, noticed that the government \u2013 kind of construction investment piece took down a \u2013 kind of moved down pretty significantly. I would have thought that, that's a big driver for the Wirtgen business, which you actually took up. Could you kind of help talk around why the lowered investment on the government side, and then kind of what's driving that outperformance for Wirtgen? Thanks.","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Yeah. The Wirtgen change from 3.1 to 3.2 (00:58:36) is just FX. No change to the underlying business there. And the government investment is North America-specific, which is from a Wirtgen perspective the Americas are 25%, so it's not as material to the Wirtgen business as it would, say, to our C&F business, which is by and large more North American. So I think that's probably the biggest disconnect there if you think about how to connect those dots.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question...","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Okay. We'll take one more.","Operator","And our final question today is from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Hi, thank you for taking the follow-up. Can you talk about, in Brazil, there's been a regulatory changeover within the past year. Can you just comment on how that impacted your production schedule in calendar 2017? And how you expect the production ramp to look over the course of 2018?","Joshua Jepsen - Deere & Co.","Yeah, so the emissions change happened last January, and really \u2013 and leading up to that, we didn't necessarily build inventory ahead of that. We were building, as you may recall in November, December, there was strong demand. We were seeing the early stages of the recovery there. So we were really building just to meet demand at that point. So we didn't have a significant overproduction that we then bled-off. I'd say we built that pretty much in line or as close to in line as we could based on the strong demand. And I think as we go into this year, we'd see, I think, more of the same there in terms of our plans.","There have been \u2013 there was the, as Brent mentioned, the grace period got extended from 12 months to 14 months for the FINAME financing. That took effect in January, but was announced earlier. So you did see a bit of a pause in terms of retail activity as folks could wait a few weeks in order to get that two months of additional grace period.

After that we\u2019ll respond to your questions.","Please note that slides are available to complement the call this morning.

Susan?","Susan Karlix","Thank you, Tony. Today John Deere announced third quarter earnings and all in all, it was a solid performance. In fact, our income of $851 million was the second highest for any third quarter in company history, exceeded only by last year's total.","Our results did reflect moderating conditions in a global farm sector, which hurt demand for farm machinery and contributed to lower sales and profits for our Ag and turf business. However, our other division's construction and forestry and financial services saw improvement in their results. This shows the benefit of having a broad-based business line-up.","Overall then it was a quarter of solid performance and one that puts the company on the home stretch of another good year.","Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter in detail beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 5% to $9.5 billion. Net income attributable to Deere and Company was $851 million. EPS was $2.33 in the quarter.","On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 6% to $8.7 billion. In the quarter-over-quarter comparison of net sales, Landscapes accounted for four points of the change. Price realization in the quarter was positive by two points.","Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Sales were down 11%, primarily due to lower shipment volume, as well as the four point landscapes impact noted on the previous slide. Operating profit was $941 million.","In addition to volume, margins in the quarter were negatively impacted by higher production cost related to engine emission regulation, which includes product's material costs and foreign exchange.","Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the Ag businesses. Slide 6 outlines U.S. Farm Cash Receipts, which are forecast to be down somewhat from 2013.","Assuming above trend yields, grain and soybean production levels are expected to be up in 2014, which is resulting in lower prices for those crops. Livestock receipts are forecast to remain at record levels. As a result, our forecasts calls for 2014 cash receipts to be about $387 billion, down about 5% from 2013, which is forecast to be the highest level ever recorded.","Concerning cash receipts for next year, based on our expectation that record grain yields in 2014 and resulting lower commodity prices, our very early forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 3% in 2015.","On Slide 7, global grain stocks to use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels, even after abundant harvest in 2013. Although supplies appear to be adequate, global grain and oil seed demand remain strong. Unfavorable growing conditions in any key growing region of the world coupled with the unknown impacts for geopolitical issues could lower production; reduce the stock to use ratio and result in prices quickly moving higher.","Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. There are signs of economic stabilization and cyclical recovery, with a modest forecast increase in GDP growth, rising consumer and business confidence and increased exports.","With feed costs easing, strong beef prices and near record milk prices, margins remain supportive for livestock and dairy farmers; however, grain prices have declined and farm income is expected to decrease in 2014. As a result, farm machinery demand is expected to be lower for the year.","Furthermore, a differentiated picture continues to exist by country. While demand is improving in the U.K. and Spain, we are seeing decline in important markets like France and German.","On Slide 9, you\u2019ll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In the CIS, declining economic growth and further tightening of credit availability continues to weigh on equipment sales, notably Western equipment manufacturers are being impacted by the uncertainty from geo-political issues in the region.","Economic growth is expected to slow in China in the second half of the year and the Ag economy there is slowing as well due to lower grain prices. And, ongoing subsidies are supportive of agriculture, their pace of increase has slowed. In addition, the construction sector recession has deepened.","Turning to India, although rainfall is expected to return to a more normal level, the weak onset of the monsoon season and minimal precipitation in key agricultural regions could have a negative impact on production.","Slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good prospect for the health of agro business in Brazil. The 2014 value of Ag production is expected to increase about 5% over the 2013 level. Even with the recent drop in prices Ag fundamentals remain strong for grain helped by 2013s extremely strong market and favorable financing environment. On the other hand, while partially offset by the weak real, lower global commodity prices could reduce farm income.","Our 2014 Ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 11. Although the Ag economy remains in a relatively healthy state, falling commodity prices are putting pressure on demand for farm equipment, especially larger models.","At the same time, strength in the livestock sector is providing support to sales of mid and smaller size tractors. As a result, we now expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 10% this year.","The EU28 industry outlook remains down about 5% due to lower crop prices and farm income. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down about 15% from 2013s strong levels.","Shifting to the CIS, we continue to expect industry sales to be down significantly, with western Ag equipment manufacturers feeling the most impact due to geo-political issues and resulting credit availability. In Asia, sales are now projected to be about flat.","Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada continue to be projected at flat up 5% in 2014. Putting this all together on Slide 12, fiscal year 2014 Deere sales of worldwide Ag and turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 10%. In the year-over-year comparison of net sales, landscape accounts for about three points of the change and negative currency translation accounts for about one point.","The reduction in our forecast from last quarter mainly reflects lower industry outlooks for sprayer and turf sales in the United States and lower sales in Brazil and Canada. The 2014 forecast for the Ag and turf division operating margin remains at about 14%.","The two point decline in operating margin from 2013 is a result of volume, mix, foreign exchange and higher production costs, including product and implementation costs related to the final Tier 4.","Before turning to construction and forestry, let\u2019s touch on used equipment. Strong, large Ag tailwinds have driven record new equipment sales growth and higher levels of used inventory. The rise in used inventory has been steady across large Ag product lines and the spread between used prices and their original new prices has widened from the tightest ever spreads of 2008 and 2009. Specifically, Deere prices are holding up as well or better than the competition.","Our dealer's ability to move used equipment is crucial to our long-term strategy. A new tool to enable this is outlined on Slide 13.","Earlier this month, the John Deere certified pre-owned program was introduced, combines less than two years old with less than 1,000 hours and eight hour and four wheel drive tractors, less than three years old and fewer than 1,500 hours are eligible.","Products in the program will undergo rigorous inspection. More than 280 points on combines and 150 on tractors will be inspected and tested by John Deere certified technicians. Products also will be backed by an industry leading one-year 500-hour comprehensive power guard warranty and include a one-year subscription to JDLink.","This will allow our used equipment customers to experience uptime similar to new equipment\u2019s, and take advantage of the increased fuel economy, comfort convenience and technology, associated with late model.","Now, let\u2019s focus on construction and forestry on Slide 14. Net sales were up 19% in the quarter, and operating profit was up 81%. The division\u2019s incremental margin of about 31% was a result of increased volume and price. Our less favorable product mix, negatively affected C&F operating margin in the quarter. This was driven by a tough comparison on service parts and a less favorable region mix primarily driven by increased sales in Brazil.","Moving to Slide 15, looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, although growth has been disappointing, the United States economy is slowly moving forward and there are positive signs in the market.","Unemployment is falling and construction hiring is increasing. Housing starts are slowly ramping up, home inventories are low and existing home sales are rebounding. Landscaping activity is picking up, and financing for land developers is slowly recovering.","Additionally, we continue to see a strong domestic energy sector. Based on these factors, Deere\u2019s construction and forestry sales are forecast to be up about 10% for the year, this is unchanged from our initial outlook in November, 2013.","Our C&F order books are strong. The outlook for the year contemplates increased shipment following the low levels of 2013 as well as industry growth in response to an improving U.S. economy and increased international sales.","Global forestry markets are expected to be up about 10% in 2014, unchanged from our previous forecast. Following double-digit growth in 2013, North American forestry markets are expected to be up about 10%, while Europe and Russia are expected to improve from the depressed levels of 2013. C&F\u2019s full year operating margin is projected to be about 9%.","Let\u2019s move now to our financial services operations. Slide 16 shows the financial services provision for credit losses as a percentage of the total average owned portfolio at the end of July with 10 basis points. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios.","Our 2014 financial forecast contemplates a loss provision of about 11 basis points. Losses remain well below the 10-year average of 28 basis points, and the 15-year average of 48 basis points.","Moving to Slide 17, worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $162 million in the third quarter versus $150 million last year. 2014 net income attributable to Deere & Company is forecast to be about $600 million, which is unchanged from a quarter ago.","Slide 18 outlines receivables and inventory. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $469 million. That was equal to about 30% of prior 12-month sales, the same as the situation a year ago.","Ag and turf ending receivables and inventory were down $552 million. Most of the decrease was accounted for by John Deere Landscapes and John Deere Water. For your reference, we have included on this slide, receivables and inventory for our landscapes and water businesses at the end of the third quarter and fiscal year 2013.","Construction and forestry ended the quarter up about $83 million. We expect to end 2014 with total receivables and inventory down about $300 million.","Our 2014 guidance for cost of sales as a percentage of net sales shown on Slide 19 remains at about 75%. When modeling 2014, keep in mind the following: price, about two points; lower pension OPEB expense; overhead spending due to tier 4 transition, less favorable mix of product; and tier 4 product cost.","Looking at R&D expense on slide 20, R&D was up about 7% in the third quarter, but is forecast to be down about 2% for the year.","Moving now to Slide 21, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down about 15% in the third quarter and is forecast to now be down about 10% for the year. In the year-over-year comparison of SA&G expenses, Landscapes accounts for about seven points of the change and water about one point.","On Slide 22, pension and OPEB expense was down about $40 million in the quarter and is forecast to be down about $150 million for the full year.","Turning to Slide 23, the equipment operations tax rate was approximately 35% in the third quarter, and is now forecast to be in the range of 33% to 34% for the year.","On Slide 24 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Our forecast for cash flow from equipment operations is approximately $3.7 billion in 2014. The 2014 outlook for the fourth quarter and full year are on slide 25 and 26.","Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 8% compared with 2013. This includes about one point of price realization. In the year-over-year comparison of fourth quarter sales, Landscapes accounts for about three points of the change and John Deere water about one point.","The full year forecast calls for net sales to be down about 6%. In the year-over-year comparison of net sales, Landscapes accounts for about three points of the change. Price realization is expected to be positive by about two points. FX is expected to be negative by about one point. Finally our full year 2014 net income is now forecast at about $3.1 billion.","In closing, John Deere is looking forward to completing another successful year. What\u2019s more, we continue to believe the longer term outlook for our businesses holds considerable promise. For the balance of the year, the company will be scaling back production in line with demand for agricultural products.","Actions that illustrate our commitment to responding decisively to change the market conditions. At the same time, plans to expand Deere\u2019s market presence throughout the world remain on track and are continuing to move ahead.","As a result, we have confidence, the company is well positioned to bring solid returns throughout the business cycle and to realize substantial benefits from the world\u2019s growing need for food, shelter and infrastructure in the years ahead.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Tony.","Tony Huegel","Thank you, Susan. We\u2019re now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure, but as a reminder, in consideration of others please limit yourself to one question and one related follow up. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Tim Thein with Citigroup.","Tim Thein - Citigroup","Great, thanks. Good morning. First, Tony I was hoping you could just \u2013 good morning, just update us on the early order activity in North America on your spring programs and I think you just remind us, but I think you were planning to do a bit more stocking at the dealer level this year.","So, presumably that maybe inflates things, but, can you just kind of update us in terms of what you\u2019re seeing there and tail engine or other products?","Tony Huegel","Right, we have \u2013 there are three early order programs that have just completed Phase I or about to complete Phase I in the U.S. and Canada, the sprayers, planters and tillage equipment \u2013 to your point and this would be true for various reasons, there are definitely year-over-year differences in those early order programs, for examples, planters last year had a fast start program that didn\u2019t get repeated this year.","Sprayers were pretty heavily influenced by our Tier 4 transitions last year. So, to give, in some years we\u2019ve given a percentage change and it\u2019s just really apple-to-oranges in most cases, but clearly it leads in the early indications of Phase I on those three products, we would tell that the order programs are down double digits year-over-year.","Tim Thein - Citigroup","Okay. Got it. And then secondly, on the Ag and turf margins, you called out the impacts from Tier 4 costs in the third quarter, can you just help us in terms of how we should think about \u2013 in rough terms the impact in 2015 as you transition to similar lower horsepower products which presumably take a little bit longer and are bit more difficult to cover with the price increase at least upfront or initially.","Tony Huegel","Sure. Yeah, that\u2019s a good point. In the third quarter, we did see a lot of that cost was related that we pointed out was related to product cost which is certainly higher in the third quarter as we transitioned earlier in the most of those products. And to your point, in large Ag, which is what transition this year, the cost portion of that, not necessarily cost plus margin, but the cost portion of that has largely been recovered through pricing.","As we move into 2015, that\u2019ll be a bigger challenge, not just on small Ag but also as you think about construction, similar to interim tier 4 where we were very clear in year one, we will not be recovering \u2013 did not recover the cost on interim Tier 4 in year one, the same will be true with final tier 4 on those products.","Of course in all cases we do have the three year commitment that we would cover both cost and margin. But it will take a period of time to grow into that. So, all else being equal, as you look at next year that would be a margin drag as we transition those small Ag and a lot of our construction and forestry product next year.","Tim Thein - Citigroup","Great. Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Great. Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Your next question is from Adam Uhlmanwith Cleveland Research.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Hi, good morning.","Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Just quickly a follow-up on that, Tony would you care to mention the potential margin drag that you\u2019re anticipating or at least to mention it for us?","Tony Huegel","We\u2019ve not, as you may recall couple of years ago we, as we were going to interim Tier 4, we talked about the actual cost and all the underlying pieces of cost of sales. Last year we started providing and outlook on cost of sales overall and not giving all of the individual details underlying and that would continue to be the case next year.","So, when we go, when we release our fourth quarter earnings and provide our first 2015 guidance at that point we\u2019ll have guidance on cost of sales and we\u2019ll be able to talk directionally in the order of magnitude of what\u2019s driving that cost up or down as we go into 2015.","Raj Kalathur","Hey Adam, this is Raj. One the 2015 margin, we will not get into the specifics, but let me give you some outline of how we think about it okay. These are some points you can consider with respect to it.","Assuming demand for Ag equipment in the U.S and Canada continues to moderate. One of things we\u2019ve always said, our goal is to earn above our cost of capital throughout the cycle. So think overhead absorption, we will continue to align factory production to demand as we have mentioned in the third quarter press release.","So, lower productions will have a negative impact on overhead absorption for the A&T division and especially true for large Ag products.","On SA&G side, we will continue to pull levers in SA&G expenses appropriate. And SA&G number still may go up as a percent of sales. And again all these are assuming AG equipment years and continuous to moderate.","On the R&D side, we will be pragmatic but R&D expenses balancing the need for short term lever pulling with the investment needs that can help deliver our long term aspirations.","So, number of 12, 20, 28, structure line, that is at the trough of 80% mid cycle upon it, and a peak of 120% that\u2019s approximately 28 as OROA, the operating return operating assets. That\u2019s our commitment to provide a solid return toward the cycle.","So you should think of that line, but margins will be lower as we move down the line. And as we move up the line, you have said you should expect a margins to be higher.","Some of the other considerations, material cost we are significantly impacted by steel prices. So our steel cost generally follow the market prices with the larger feet of six months. And if we can forecast few prices, that should give an indication for our material cost.","In terms of Tier 4 transitions as Tony mentioned, many of our small mid AG and C&F products will be transitioning to final Tier 4. In 2015 when higher material cost and higher spending your transition should be expected and we will not fully recover the material cost increases of the pricing in year one especially for these products.","But however we are targeting to be marginal neutral in three years. Now on pension and OPEB expense. Well there are several factor that impact pension and OPEB expenses. And they can vary significantly between and now and end of October.","If you take for example the more recent discount rate, of around 4.25, if that were to apply at the end of October, and all other factors being equal, our pension and OPEB expenses can go up, hope that\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","That is helpful. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Tony Huegel","Okay. Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","And the next question is from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America - Merrill Lynch.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning can you hear me okay.","Tony Huegel","We can. Thank you.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks Tony. So you guys are guiding to 1% pricing in the fourth quarter but still a 2% for the year. So are you seeing deterioration in the new equipment pricing outlook or this is more or less just a rounding error?","Tony Huegel","Yeah I think I would point out that it's certainly rounding can have an impact on that. So, I wouldn\u2019t read much into that.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then any thoughts on Brazil and whether or not you think the lower soybean in general AG weakness and economic weakness in Brazil incentives the government to extend FINAME into 2015 or any thoughts on FINAME in the next year?","Tony Huegel","With FINAME in general, our view would it \u2013 lot of way similar to the U.S. farm bill and in the sense that it\u2019s the process in which Brazil has helped to incentivize and help to deport agriculture as well as other businesses.","And so, again it's less of an issue in our minds of whether FINAME continues and is extended into 2015, but more about what\u2019s the rate at which it will continue.","So the budget has been set really for the year. Like I said in the June timeframe, but the current program is only defined through December. So again it's really more about what will be the rate be rather then whether it\u2019s in existence or not.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","And any initial thoughts there?","Tony Huegel","We do not have any thoughts on that at this point.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks a lot.","Tony Huegel","Okay. Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Andrew Casey with Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning.","Tony Huegel","Good morning.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Just a question Tony on the SA&G, you did really well in the third quarter down about 80 basis points year-over-year. The annual guidance kind of implies relatively flat year-over-year performance in Q4. Can you help us understand what caused the decrease in Q3 and why we really shouldn\u2019t expect that to continue into Q4?","Tony Huegel","Yeah. I think as you think about SA&G. I mean there is always, in some cases there are some timing differences between the third Q and fourth Q, our fourth quarter and that would be the case this year where you look at year-over-year comparisons, the expense hit in the third quarter last year and they will be in the fourth quarter this year.","I\u2019d also point out that fourth quarter does tend to be a heavier quarter with SA&G expenses as we finish out the year. The third thing I had mentioned is there was some favorable FX impact in the third quarter that\u2019s expected to flip and actually go the other direction.","So that would have some impact as well.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Thanks. And then on cash flow if I look at the guidance, the decreased roughly 300 million, you had an approximate 200 million decrease to net income that should be partially offset by the 150 million positive inventory and receivables. Given note change to the depreciation CapEx and just a slight change to the pension contribution, can you help us understand the puts and takes that are driving the 300 million decrease?","Tony Huegel","Yeah. You hit two of the three, the third really would be payable, the assumption round payable changed. So those are really the three things that drove that lower cash flow forecast.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks. And then if I can sneak one more in the certified years equipment program. While the equipment is waiting to be sold does that still on the dealer balance sheet or is that now at dealer balance sheet?","Tony Huegel","That would still be on the dealer's balance sheet absolutely.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay.","Tony Huegel","Think about it as another tool for our deal to help move that used equipment.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Tony Huegel","Okay. Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Hi. Good morning. I guess you know a couple of questions. One just given the risk of that I guess first question, you mentioned in your prepared -- in Q&A that when we think about the order book and you talked about sprayers, planters and tillage early indications are they are down year-over-year sorry, double digit, year-over-year historically you\u2019ve said tillage has been sort of a good indicator of demand for equipment as its more discretionary.","Would that imply as you think about 2015, when we think about large tractors and large combines that we should at least see that levels decline just given what we are seeing in tillage in a historic relationship.","And then I guess my second question is can you talk about your comfort level with the inventory at the dealer level so in the event that we do have some downtrend in 2015, where they were actively managing this so could inventory in the channel be a potential issue? Thanks.","Tony Huegel","Sure, I think as you think about the early order programs and certainly it does give some early indication of the framers and customers appetite for purchase going into the year there are variety of things they can influence that as well. So, certainly we would be using that and that would be part of evaluation as we consider what next year would be, but we would not have an outlook at this point on Ag equipment going into 2015 that were in a position to share publically.","I would stress again it is very early in the process that phase one on three of our crop care program, but it can as you pointed out in the past we've certainly viewed that as at least some directionally an idea of where sales may end up going.","Some of the things you want to be a little careful not to read too much in or try to ignore some of the fact that the difference -- there are a lot of difference year-over-year too in terms of the in years past, we have been in capacity in many of our product, customers, and dealers knew that; so there was a certainly a greater sense of urgency.","I think the expectation next year is for demand to be down and certainly we will have the capacity to meet that demand as we go into 2015. So there is that element as well. That could factor into some of those year over year differences again in a very early stages of those programs.","So we will have a much better view as we always do when we get to November with our fourth quarter earnings as we get further into the programs, start to see what\u2019s going on with combine early order programs and so on as well. So those will be some things I would mention.","From an inventory prospective I think from a concerned prospective and we talked about it all year I think the greater concern would be around used equipment as we come through a period of time with some high level of sales that brings along with it a high level of used equipment and so we are working very diligently with our dealers to bring those used inventory down in line with what we are expecting demand to be.","We talked about on the call some of the new programs we have with the certified use. Again I want to be clear this is a long-term strategic program. It isn\u2019t intended to be viewed a silver bullet to remedy the situation overnight, but it will certainly be helpful and I think this is something we have put together in conjunction with our dealers and should be very helpful especially with moving that newer equipment through the channel.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","But Tony to be clear last quarter I think you said tractors were bigger issue relative to combine is that still the case or things in total for both tractors and combines deteriorated versus last quarter or the inventory got more than?","Tony Huegel","I think that would still be the case as you look at used in and in fact I shouldn\u2019t say I think it is still the case for tractors that are a little more elevated than combines. But remember you are also going through a period where we are selling a lot of new combine just ahead of the harvest. So fall is always a critical timeframe. From moving those used combine through the system as we move through harvest.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll get back into you.","Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS","As we head into this weaker period on Ag in North America just trying to guys how you guys are really thinking about it more broadly. Are you viewing this as may be a shorter 12 months phenomenon, 18 months, or is this do you think about it as a multiyear downturn and how does that affect your planning.","Tony Huegel","Well I think the way I would answer that is at this point, as Susan mentioned in her opening comment, you are still while you are seeing stock used ratios at least to the expectation of another good year those stocks will continue to rebuild, but given the very strong demand environment on commodities as well the answer to that question is what\u2019s going to happen with the crop that will get planted next year in terms of do you have yet a third year in a row of good growing conditions on a global basis or do you have a year where those yields moderate a bit due to weather -- weather that\u2019s in the U.S. or some other region.","So that\u2019s a tough one to answer and certainly that the advantage we have I think is how we structured the business today in the sense of being able to shift, pull levers where we need to, to be able to ensure that we are able to maintain good returns throughout that cycle. So again I think it's just very premature to try to call whether this a 12-month phenomenon or longer term.","Raj Kalathur","So I'll just add that longer term tailwinds for Ag demand are still intact. Okay. So from that perspective the demand is continuing to grow and as Tony said depends on how the supply is. If the weather conditions are great everywhere then we might have issue we have today, but if the weather conditions turn out to be more erratic then you know it can be different?","Steven Fisher - UBS","Okay. And then since you mentioned the levers, I guess cheers for your views on the notion that nearly every one of the global Ag markets is down in tandem at this point and really how that affect your manufacturing strategy, exiting in the past factor utilization has been supported by allocating the U.S. capacity for shipments to some of the non-U.S. markets. So I guess I am wondering to what extent is that reallocation still an option.","Tony Huegel","That would be true Steven in some cases so as you look at tractors for example in Waterloo somewhere in the neighborhood of 30% or so typically of the production there is shipped outside of the U.S. and Canada.","I would point out some of that will change at the end of 2015 as we localize the aide tractor in Brazil. But then as you look at combines you are down in the neighborhood of 10% of the production in the U.S. is shipped outside of the U.S. and Canada. So we have shifted some of that production those large combines are now being produced in Europe for example as well as Brazil.","So that is shifting as business is growing in some of these other regions. Some of that demand has moved closer to the use. So obviously when you look at global production it still has an impact, but on specific factories in the U.S., a lot of those cases it wouldn\u2019t be as impactful as it would have been three years ago.","Steven Fisher - UBS","It's very helpful. Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays","Hi good morning guys. Sorry about that before. So Tony can you talk about dealer inventory in the construction channel actually your largest competitor in construction when it announced earnings talked about how into destock about a billing of dealer inventory in the second half of 2014 now.","We recognize that there are much more international outside of North America than you guys are, but how do you look at the dealer channel right now. How concerned you would be that there is quite a bit of inventory in the channel or is it actually in pretty good shape.","Tony Huegel","We would say the latter certainly for Deere construction and forestry inventory at the dealer channel would be at very good levels. That -- you may recall we had some questions last quarter on our sales levels and we talked about the fact -- that with our order fulfillment process and construction of forestry, we don\u2019t tend to push inventory out into the market.","Our dealers don\u2019t have a heavy rent program that they can use to bulk up their inventory level either and so we tend to run with some leaner inventories as a result, given our factory\u2019s ability to replenish that inventory pretty quickly.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays","Okay. That\u2019s helpful and Tony can you talk about your ability to get price excluding the final Tier 4 transitions. You\u2019ve maintained your guidance of the company for plus 2% from fiscal \u201914 but you\u2019re getting 1% in fiscal \u201914. If I might recall, this excludes sort of -- this pricing exclude these transitions so can you talk about the competitive environment you see in Ag. Was there any -- is mix change impacting price at all? What do you see going forward?","Tony Huegel","Certainly for this year, we \u2013 someone asked earlier and I would say it\u2019s really more about rounding than a significant change in our pricing for price realization for the fourth quarter. So again I wouldn\u2019t read much into that. As you look back over the last decade, we\u2019ve talked about this but we\u2019ve averaged a little over three points of positive price realization each year.","We\u2019re two points this year in a slower equipment demand environment especially for large Ag in the U.S. and Canada and to your point in year one of introducing Tier 4 product, we would not count the price related to that in our price realization calculation, so we\u2019re getting two points plus the pricing that we\u2019ve taken on Tier 4 for the products that transitioned this year.","So that demonstrates -- we've had pretty good pricing and again that\u2019s really about bringing efficiency and being able to provide that higher productivity to the farmer to warrant that higher pricing.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays","Thanks Tony.","Tony Huegel","Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","The next question is from Larry De Maria with William Blair","Larry De Maria - William Blair","Hi, good morning. Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Hello.","Larry De Maria - William Blair","Hey, sorry about that before. Long term fundamentals and demands obviously suggest money for food, and that\u2019s kind of always been the case but there\u2019s been through the long term weakness in equipment when we come off from below its kind of like we are in the 90s.","So I am just curious what is different or the same in this cycle compared to 90s balance sheet just kind of similar in good shape down like they were back then and to call that weather and politics, that potential changes to the trajectory but -- and obviously the supply side is where you\u2019re focused on if there\u2019s a weather interruption but could you just help us understand -- what is similar or different about this cycle versus the late 90s, which had a relatively extended period of downturn?","Tony Huegel","I think one thing I would point out is -- you mentioned balance sheets and certainly compared to the 80s it would be better today but even compared to the late 90s, if you look at the data you are in even better shape. We talk a lot about the underlying demand of commodities and we continue to point to that as well in the sense of our -- historically the cycles have been much more about changes in supply.","There a lot of conversations around ethanol for example, which has been very supportive over the last decade of building supply and while the growth is clearly moderating on ethanol demands.","There are corn used ethanol. The supporting demand is still in place and our view is you\u2019re going to continue to see food demand pickup in other parts of the world and see that growth curve continue to be very strong and that is basically where we think it\u2019s going to be different year-on-year or this time around.","Raj Kalathur","And Larry, aside from the market demand, we also want to look at the improvements we\u2019ve made structurally to our business and that will be a difference between 90s and now. Okay? So we think structurally we're in a better position at this time above our cost to capital at any point in the cycle now.","Larry De Maria - William Blair","Okay, thank guys. And then back then you used to talk about -- you've had your economic model that would talk like normal like tractor demand and combine demand, which however shot to the downside because the fundamentals returned pretty bad back then but care to offer kind of some perspective on where a novelized demand where the model which you just had moved long term averages are for tractor and combine demand given that we are coming off, obviously at a very high level and where we can think about novelized support in an environment like this.","Tony Huegel","Yeah, at this point, we\u2019ve not disclosed and especially for a specific product where we are as a percent of normal. We\u2019ve talked about it in our forecast for 2014, we'd tell you with our current forecast we would be slightly below mid cycle and on a global basis for Ag and turf would be again slightly below mid cycle with our current forecast but beyond that there\u2019s not much help I can give.","Larry De Maria - William Blair","Well, can you say where would be in North America then as far as you would see.","Tony Huegel","The only thing we have provided is on a global basis. So that\u2019s really all the help I am going to be able to give in that regard.","Larry De Maria - William Blair","Okay. Thanks Tony.","Tony Huegel","Okay? You bet. Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","The next question is from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank","Thanks for taking my question. I was just curious as to what do you think about the Brazilian market outlook. I know that you\u2019ve talked in the past about outgrowing that market in light of the down 15% industry forecast.","What do you think can you maintain relatively flattish revenues in that market and also how do you think about opportunity in the EU28 region considering some of the share gain initiatives that you have in place over there?","Tony Huegel","If you think about Brazil in to your point, we\u2019ve mentioned this throughout the year and we continue to be true. As you look at the industry guidance that we provide versus Deere expectations of sales, South America would be the greatest differential on the positive side for Deere. Some of that is the fact that we provide industry guidance on tractors and combines only in South America and of course we have a full line of products offered there.","With this latest downturn, we were seeing -- we weren\u2019t necessarily second Deere sales to be down. I don\u2019t believe I can say that anymore but certainly strongly outperforming the industry both because of the strength of our broad portfolio there.","Also the market share gains that we continue to get on both tractors and combines. So that certainly will drive that. If you think about the market in general, it\u2019s important to know that you\u2019re coming off, it\u2019s a down year -- you're coming off of a record level in 2013.","So most in that market would tell you things aren\u2019t what they would consider weak just because there\u2019s year-on-year, things continue to be very strong. Soya bean farmers even at these levels of pricing are still in profitable territory and so we still have a very positive view on Brazil as we move forward.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s helpful and just on EU28 share again opportunities, are you seeing any of that play out this year and also what\u2019s your view of decremental margins in North America given the mix shift towards small Ag. Are we looking at 40% detrimental margins or slightly more than that next year? Thank you.","Tony Huegel","If you think about EU28 obviously we continue to be in a difficult market there. We\u2019ve seen sales forecast to be lower year-on-year. So we\u2019re making good progress in terms of our dealer consolidation there, those sorts of things. So we feel like we\u2019re putting ourselves in a good position though -- to be candid the market share has been a little slower to come though from a strategic perspective we\u2019re still very encouraged by that.","Just real quickly on margins, obviously we don\u2019t disclose margin by individual product but certainly we\u2019ve been very clear that large Ag equipment has better margins than small. So if you\u2019re expecting a decrease next year and you assume it\u2019s all large Ag driven decreases than the incremental will be difficult. But at this point, it\u2019s again premature really to talk about any kind of specifics in that regard. So anyway with that we\u2019ll move on to next caller.","Operator","And your next question is from Robert Wertheimer with Vertical Research.","Tony Huegel","Hi Rob.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","Sorry for the interruption before. And I apologize if these have been asked before. I\u2019ll just ask three and you can skip if they have been. On the certified used, what seems like a nice way to sort of manage without giving price discounts. Is there a fee charge for the buyer or is that sort of gratis in the way for you give away something that you can deliver cost effect away?","Will your production plan be influenced, are you going to change the way you sell it all if use inventories rise and then make the dealers place that use before they\u2019re taking order? And last question, do you contemplate in making a cost to capital if you go below the 80% cyclical industry strength? Thanks.","Tony Huegel","Yeah, I\u2019ll start with the used. And I am not aware of any fee that will charged to the customer related to that certified used. Again it\u2019s a tool that the dealer can offer. Now certainly while there may not be a specific fee, we would expect that that\u2019s going to help drive higher pricing on that used piece of equipment as it comes with again additional inspection on the product, the warranty, the free one year JDLink again should be very supportive of the underlying pricing that the dealer gets on that particular piece of equipment.","Again in terms of the way we sell equipment in terms of expecting dealers to have a used piece of equipment sold before we ship new, I think it was your question. There is certainly not a change there.","We have talked about on combines as we allocate our early order program. We do the used inventory adding individual dealers location would impact -- does have some impact on the allocation of orders they get in any particular phase of our early order program but that would be the only area that I could really point to that we\u2019re looking at that from a -- what we\u2019re selling new equipment.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","Got it.","Tony Huegel","Okay?","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","And I am sorry. On the trough, if you go below 80% do you still hope to cover the cost to capital or is that something you don\u2019t contemplate?","Raj Kalathur","Hey Rob. It\u2019s too early to say anything now. What we will tell you is again and I said earlier, it\u2019s not something that we look at in terms of below trough on a daily basis, okay? What we do is we do model 80120 and what I clearly said is 80120 we know and we perceive.","Our goal is to -- we've done a model cost to capital. So we model those, we know those, we talk about those and we can talk more detail at the right time but I don\u2019t think we should get beyond that right now.","Tony Huegel","One other thing I would point is there\u2019s a lot of talk about large Ag and reductions that are expected in large Ag. Remember, on the flip side of that livestock continues to do a very well margins or very strong in small Ag volume not as profitable as large stock. It\u2019s still very profitable and we\u2019re looking at an opportunity to see some strengthening in that part of the business that will certainly help from a returns perspective.","So it\u2019s not all a downward trajectory if you look at again our broad base of business and similarly we have construction in forestry that -- if you look at underlying fundamentals, continue to support some recovery in that particular division. So there are some bright spots in the enterprise that we can point to as well.","Tony Huegel","Yeah. Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","The next question is from Mike Shlisky with Global Hunter.","Mike Shlisky - Global Hunter","Good morning. I noticed in your financials that your interest comp to the fin co. was up about 9% from prior year almost up a little bit as a percent of overall sales. Can you tell something financing programs that you haven\u2019t placed today compared to either maybe last quarter or last year? What kind of change as far as how you have farmers -- finance your equipment from the marketing side?","Tony Huegel","Yeah, if you\u2019re looking at the comp to credit line on the equipment operation side, is that correct?","Mike Shlisky - Global Hunter","Correct.","Tony Huegel","Yeah. Keep in mind, that is really what you\u2019ve seen reflected there relates the wholesale financing. So to be extensive there is a period of interest free or low interest on the wholesale financing available as we ship the product to the dealer prior to them settling that equipment. That gets charged back to the equipment operations and on that line. So it really isn\u2019t reflective of any kind of changes in incentives on retail sales. That actually would impact our net sales as a sales discount.","Mike Shlisky - Global Hunter","Got it and then looking at your prophecies you did mention that you have livestock down in 2015. Just want a little bit more color there. Is there going to be any more pricing or is just smaller herds and kind of what do you see as far as the health of the livestock farmers out there with current feed costs so low?","Tony Huegel","Yeah, as I just mentioned when we were talking with Rob, they\u2019re in very very good shape, livestock producers margins are very strong, really across the board. If you look into next year, you\u2019re coming off of record high prices and the expectation is that you would see some moderation there as production starts to come up. But to your last point, still a very good level and margins should remain strong from both livestock producers at least for the foreseeable future.","Mike Shlisky - Global Hunter","All right. Thanks so much.","Tony Huegel","Okay? Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","The next question is from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Yeah, hi. Good morning.","Raj Kalathur","Good morning.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Can we talk a little bit about your outlook for crop cash receipts and you\u2019re looking for the kind of 3% into 2015. When we take the average prices in yields from Wall Street from yesterday we get minus 15. So I am just curious why the difference between you and USDA. What\u2019re you seeing out there is that you believe prices will be higher and yields lower?","Tony Huegel","Well, first of all I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say -- the USDA have not updated their cash receipts number and keep in mind the cash received -- that when you look at crop prices and yield, that\u2019s on a commodity year basis and again as you know in cash receipts are on a calendar year basis.","So 2014 cash receipts are being impacted by somewhat by what will get sold this fall for the current crop. Similarly 2015 cash receipts will be impacted by some assumptions of next year\u2019s crops if they get sold immediately following harvest.","So it\u2019s not as simple as taking what the changes are, what the current year crop prices are times production. But I would point out as you think about cash receipts to that point it\u2019s not just about the lower pricing, it is also about production. So as you have higher yields, more commodities to sell even in a lower pricing environment that\u2019s supportive of the overall cash receipt.","The other fact that it\u2019s hard to weigh in there is which would be anticipated in the USDA price assumptions for the current year but how much has been sold ahead and is that sold ahead going to occur in calendar year \u201914 or is that contract are for some time in early 2015 for example, in terms of whether those land that -- and are \u201914 cash receipts or \u201915.","So that\u2019s a long way of seeing -- cash receipts is a pretty complex calculation. You can\u2019t simply look at the USDA reports and make good assumptions from that. But it its early and we would be very quick to point that out. It\u2019s a very forecast on what we see is 2015.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Yes but your outlook for farm commodity prices is higher than what the USDA said yesterday, I appreciate all the\u2026","Tony Huegel","It would be higher than the midpoint of their range. It is not outside of their range.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Fair and secondly I am just curious. I am out here in Illinois at conference with couple of 100 of your suppliers on the hydraulic side, I am just curious what kind of conversations you are having with your supply base at this point in the cycle and what kinds of expectations are you setting for your supply base going into 2015.","Tony Huegel","Yeah. That\u2019s not something we are going to discuss. We view our supply base as partners and we on a regular basis have conversation with them to make sure they are prepared to meet the demand.","Raj Kalathur","Ann, this is Raj, on the supplier side, we have a process we follow. So we routinely sit down with them and talk about our orders regardless of where they are right upside or downside, or a safe side. So we will follow the same process that we had in the past.","Tony Huegel","We will move on to the next caller. Thanks Ann.","Operator","The next question is from Joel Tiss with BMO Capital Markets","Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets","I learned something today to my next time my wife bust my chops about getting fat I\u2019ll just tell her its rounding error. So two things probably more just clarifications I didn\u2019t hear you mention why the credit loss provisions were rising?","Tony Huegel","Well. We've anticipated that really even last year again that 10 point provision is I would argue it's just reflective of the strength of our credit portfolio. It's still well below our historic ranges. When we were at three points and zero points two years ago, we were very clear those are not sustainable levels and they at some time point we are going to move back towards those historic ranges.","Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets","So I was just looking for any color like is it a little more Russian focused or is there anything else underneath that, but I can follow-up through.","Raj Kalathur","As you know Joel this is still a very strong any which way you look at it and you are not reading anymore into it.","Tony Huegel","In some -- portion of that is lack of recovery. As you look at the provision last couple of years some of that has been recovery of some of the prior year right off and as we had some very good years there just aren\u2019t the losses to recovery that we've had previously.","Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Great. And you haven\u2019t talked very much about share repurchased and I know you have your priorities for cash and all that, but you just give us a little flavor of what you guys are thinking around that going forward.","Raj Kalathur","We will sound like a broken record on this Joel again. Our cash used policy outlined in Slide 29 has not changed and we don\u2019t have any intentions of changing it.","Again, Single A rating is highest priority for and growth capital expenditures, M&A next priority and consistent moderate dividend increase and you want to have it at 25% -- the pay out at 25% to 35% on mid cycle earnings and then share repurchase, which is as I said, Joel use of cash and we do it when its is enhancing for our long-term shareholders.","And what I will add as we have confidence in our ability to generate good operating cash flow throughout the business cycles and so you should expect us to continue with our cash use policy as stated and you can think on what we did last three years that should be an indication of how we will act in the future.","Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets","All right. Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Thank you and we will take one more call.","Operator","The last question is from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks guys. Most of them asked and answered, but can you just give us any update or sense what you are thinking about Section 179 or bonus depreciation, how you are thinking about that and kind of just what you are hearing about that from a legislative prospective?","Tony Huegel","Sure. As you think about Section 179 I think most would argue that the most like scenario is that both Section 179 and bonus depreciation would be extended at 2013 levels, but not likely to happen before midterm elections and again any extension would likely be retroactive in pickup 2014.","Actually if you look at what we have in our model, we've actually taken a bit more conservative approach as we look at both our 2014 and 2015 models and we have our models assuming no extension, but again as you read and what we're hearing the more, most are assuming that it will still be extended at those 2013 levels.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That's all I had. Thank you very much.","Tony Huegel","Thank you. And again we apologize for the interruption in the middle of the call. Hopefully we did extend the call a bit.

Also on the call today are Ryan Campbell, our Chief Financial Officer; John Lagemann, Senior Vice President Ag & Turf, Sales and Marketing; and Brent Norwood, Manager, Investor Communications.","Today, we\u2019ll take a closer look at Deere\u2019s fourth quarter earnings, then spend some time talking about our markets and current outlook for fiscal 2019. After that, we\u2019ll respond to your questions.","First, a reminder. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet and recorded for future transmission and use by Deere & Company.

Brent?","Brent Norwood","John Deere completed the fourth quarter with a strong finish in retail sales for both divisions. While uncertainty lingers in the U.S. ag market, replacement demand and increased adoption of precision technology will continue to be critical factors for 2020. As North American farmers work through trade issues and adverse weather conditions, sentiment in Brazil remains stable, offsetting weakness in other South American markets such as Argentina.","In the Construction & Forestry division, retail demand remains steady as end markets benefit from generally positive economic conditions. At the same time, dealers are cautiously managing inventory levels to ensure their ability to meet current demand while maintaining flexibility as activity fluctuates.","Now, let's take a closer look at our year-end results for 2019, beginning on slide three. For the full year, net sales and revenue were up 5% to $39.258 billion, while net sales for equipment operations were up 5% to $34.886 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $3.253 billion or $10.15 per diluted share. The results included a favorable benefit of $68 million to the provision for income taxes due to U.S. tax reform. Excluding this item, adjusted net income was $3.185 billion or $9.94 per diluted share.","Slide four shows the results for the fourth quarter. Net sales and revenue were up 5% to $9.896 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $722 million or $2.27 per diluted share. The results included a favorable benefit of $41 million to the provision for income taxes due to U.S. tax reform. Excluding this item, adjusted net income was $681 million or $2.14 per diluted share.","On slide five, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 4% to $8.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 3 points, while currency translation was negative by 2 points. ","At this point, I'd like to welcome to the call John Lagemann, Senior Vice President of Ag & Turf, Sales and Marketing to discuss the fundamentals affecting the ag business. John?","John Lagemann","Thanks, Brent, and good morning all. Let's start with quarter's results on slide six.","Net sales were up 3% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, primarily driven by strong price realization and slightly higher volumes. Operating profit was $527 million, resulting in a 9.2% operating margin for the division. The year-over-year decline was largely due to higher production cost, SA&G, and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, partially offset by positive price realization.","Importantly, our North American large ag business finished the quarter with strong retail sales, putting us in an excellent inventory position for the start of 2020. In the U.S., the large tractor and combine inventory to sales ratio is the lowest it's been since 2014, which puts us in a good position to produce in line with retail demand for North America large ag in 2020.","Now turning to slide seven, let's take a closer look at some of the fundamentals affecting the agricultural economy. It's been a year of uncertainty for corn and soybean growers in the U.S. In addition to continued trade uncertainty and near-term demand concerns, stemming from African swine fever, and unusually wet spring, delayed planting this season, which ultimately resulted in fewer corn and soybean acres for the year.","Compounding matters further, difficult weather conditions this fall has significantly delayed harvest, which is now the slowest -- the fourth slowest on record for corn. The combination of these factors have pressured grain supplies for the year.","More specifically, despite these lower levels of supply, overall grain consumption increased for the period, contributing to a decline in the stocks to use ratio for both corn and soybeans, and in turn higher year-over-year prices for both commodities in 2019. The wheat global stocks to use ratio is expected to rise again in 2019 as production increases in Russia and Ukraine more than offset dryness in Argentina and Australia. Ending stocks for 2019 reflect record high levels for global wheat inventories.","Now slide eight outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. 2019 farm cash receipts are estimated to increase about 2% year-over-year to $395 billion, while net cash income is estimated to be up around 7% to $113 billion. The increase in crop cash receipts and income is largely attributed to the market facilitation payments from the USDA, which are expected to contribute approximately $17 billion to the U.S. farm economy this year. As they complete their harvest, farmers will assess their individual situations to determine how best to allocate the year-over-year increase in receipts and income.","Before addressing our industry outlook on slide nine, I'd like to first provide a high level overview on the state of the North American ag industry. Despite uncertainty from trade, weather and ASF, we are still in a replacement market that if anything is becoming more amplified. Let me explain.","First of all, while this uncertainty has slowed replacement rates in both 2018 and 2019, and long-term trade resolution is still clearly desired, we do see some evidence that U.S. farmer sentiment is beginning to improve, as farmers acclimate over time to planning in a more uncertain trade environment.","Secondly, the fleet age in the U.S. has reached its highest point in over a decade. And our 2020 outlook anticipates even further aging of this fleet. This supports our view that many U.S. customers will reach a point where they simply need to replace their equipment. And with that impact, a gradual recovery of the equipment investment cycle will resume, as customers make decisions to upgrade their operations.","Lastly, in addition to the advanced age of the fleet, the impact of precision technology is further driving these replacement decisions. Throughout this prolonged period of uncertainty, farmers have continued to invest in technologies that deliver high ROIs and operational efficiencies. And there is no doubt that our own product introductions in this area of precision ag technology have had a distinct impact on the financial and operational performance of our customers, and never was that more evident than this year as our customers used these technologies to better manage the adverse weather conditions, I mentioned earlier. This impact of technology has also been very apparent in the results of our early order programs, where we have seen increased take rates for precision features compared to last year.","And speaking of our early order programs, the final phase of the planter and sprayer EOP concluded in October with mixed results on a unit basis. Early orders for planters finished up single digits with take rates for ExactEmerge technology up again significantly for fiscal year 2020.","Sprayer orders were down low double digits with the U.S. results down single digits, and Canada orders were down significantly more. It's also important to note that the first phase of these programs was significantly impacted by the late planting this season and that orders for the subsequent two phases were up quite significantly on a year-over-year basis. Our combine early order program completed the first of three phases in October with results down double digits. Similar to our crop EOP, the results of the first phase were negatively impacted by lower activity in Canada as well as the delayed harvest that I mentioned earlier.","Given the late harvest, this year's program may be more backend weighted towards phases two and three. Also, due to strong take rates in 2018 and 2019, Combine Advisor was moved into the base model for 2020, indicating a significant adoption of this game-changing feature.","Our tractor order book currently extends through the end of March, which is well ahead of last year. The strong order book is largely attributable to a mid-year model change as we transition to the all new 8R tractor featured at AGRITECHNICA this year. More specifically, our current order bank reflects the sellout of the current model as we begin taking orders for the new 8R starting in December.","We'll talk more about this new 8R as the year progresses. But simply put, it is the most technologically advanced tractor we've ever made and loaded with our latest precision technologies. This new model will feature upgrades in guidance, connectivity and user experience while enabling further electrification of associated implements. And initial reaction to these features has been very positive for both customers and dealers. We intend to begin production during the third quarter.","With that context, let's turn to our 2020 ag & turf industry outlook on slide nine. Ag industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be down about 5% for 2020 with the year-over-year decline reflective of a cautious environment. Concerning the U.S. market, it's worth noting that we\u2019ve made some adjustments to our leasing operations to address recent losses in the U.S. portfolio. Although the overall used equipment market continues to be quite stable, our lease return rates remain at elevated levels. At the same time, we've taken actions to reduce our matured lease inventory, which put downward pressure on our recovery rates in the wholesale market and contributed to the disclosed impairment. But, to address this situation going forward, we have taken the following actions. First, we've adjusted lease residual values to better reflect the current environment. Next, we've announced changes to our leasing program that will include a risk sharing mechanism with our dealers to ensure alignment. And lastly, we will realign our performance and incentive structures in order to increase dealer collaboration in our collective remarketing efforts.","In summary, we have taken significant actions to enhance our positions with our current leasing portfolio and our overall leasing strategy going forward.","In terms of our current portfolio, we have reduced mature lease inventory during 2019 and are now turning net inventory much faster. Regarding our leasing strategy going forward, the changes I highlighted, should provide for greater efficiency and managing the overall portfolio, while remaining competitive in the marketplace. And these changes will enable us to better leverage the strength of our dealer organization by allowing them to control the inventory in their own area of responsibility. This in turn will also support the evolution of promoting production systems versus individual products, because they can better manage their customers\u2019 trade cycles.","We\u2019ve received a variety of feedback from our dealers, but many of our strongest dealers view these changes as quite positive. They also see them as obvious evolution to our leasing strategy that reflects the growing importance of leasing to the overall industry.","Now, moving on to the EU28. The industry outlook is forecast to be flat in 2020, as most regions impacted from last year's drought, are expected to recover with favorable production for the year. Furthermore, the outlook for the dairy sector remains stable.","In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be flat for the year. Sentiment in Brazil remains very stable with high levels of grain production combined with healthy producer margins and restored liquidity in the financing market, driving a positive outlook. However, other Latin American markets like Mexico and to a greater extent Argentina, face near-term challenges due to the potential for adverse policy impacting the ag sector. Shifting to Asia, industry sales are expected to be flat with growth in India offset by slowness in China. And lastly, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat in 2020 based on stable general economic factors.","Now moving on to the ag and turf forecast on slide 10. Fiscal year 2020 sales of worldwide ag and turf equipment are now forecasted to be down between 5% and 10%, which includes expectations of two points of positive price realization and currency headwind of about one point. Also note that our sales forecast does contemplate producing below retail demand for some small ag products in 2020.","Our full year operating margin forecast is ranging between 10.5% and 11.5%.","I will now turn the call back over to Brent Norwood. Brent?","Brent Norwood","Now, let's focus on Construction & Forestry on slide 11. Net sales of $2.947 billion were up 8%, primarily due to shipment volumes and positive price realization for the quarter. Operating profit was $261 million, benefiting from increased shipment volumes and price realization offset by higher production costs, SA&G and a negative mix. Similar to the ag division, C&F also finished 2019 with strong retail activity, keeping inventory to sales ratio within a desirable range.","Moving to the C&F outlook on slide 12, Deere's Construction & Forestry 2020 sales are forecast to down between 10% and 15%, compared to last year. The year-over-year decline is driven mostly by a mid-single-digit underproduction to retail volume versus a building of inventory in 2019. The order book remains healthy and back within our historical 30 to 60-day replenishment window, while the overall industry activity remains steady.","The global forestry market forecast is expected to be flat with growth coming from products in Europe offsetting declines in the U.S. and Russian markets. C&F\u2019s full year operating margin is projected to be between 9.5% to 10.5% with roadbuilding margins higher than the overall division.","Let's move now to our financial services operation on slide 13. Worldwide financial services and net income attributable to Deere & Company was $90 million in the fourth quarter and $539 million for the full year. The provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average owned portfolio was 7 basis points for 2019.","Fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by a 77 million pre-tax impairment charge relating to the operating lease portfolio. As John mentioned earlier, we've already implemented measures to adjust lease program going forward to ensure stronger dealer alignment for remarketing returned machines on future releases. For fiscal year 2020, net income is forecast to be $600 million, which contemplates a tax rate of 24% to 26%. The provision for credit losses in 2020 is forecast at 19 basis points.","Slide 14 outlines receivables and inventories. For the Company as a whole, trade receivables and inventories ended the year up about $52 million, which was well below our forecast as a decrease in the ag division was offset by increases in C&F. In the C&F division, the full year rise is largely attributable to building some field inventory after a historically low position at the start of 2019. In ag, Deere's decrease is mainly attributable to a strong finish in retail sales and underproduction in large ag in 2019.","Moving to slide 15, cost of sales for the fourth quarter and the full year was 77% of net sales. Our guidance for 2020 is about 76%, down 1 point year-over-year. R&D was up about 4% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. And our forecast for 2020 is down 2% from 2019 levels. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up 8% in the quarter and 3% for the full year, while next year's forecast is down 3% from 2019.","Turning to slide 16. The fourth quarter included a $41 million benefit to the provision for income taxes and other favorable discrete adjustments resulting in a 9% tax rate for the period. Full-year 2019 rate of 20% included a $68 million benefit related to tax reform adoption. For 2020, the full year effective tax rate is now projected to be between 24% to 26%.","Slide 17 shows our equipment operations cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be in a range of $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion in 2020. The guidance reflects a potential $300 million voluntary contribution to our OPEB plans.","Finally, the Company's fiscal year 2020 net income outlook is on slide 18. Our full year outlook calls for net income to be between $2.7 billion and $3.1 billion.","I will now turn the call over to Ryan Campbell, for closing comments, Ryan?","Ryan Campbell","Before we respond to your questions, I'd first like to offer some closing thoughts on 2019 and then provide an update to some key initiatives we have underway in 2020.","In summary, 2019 was a challenging year with respect to losses in our lease portfolio and managing through midyear production cuts in large ag. However, the measures we've taken position us with greater flexibility to respond to market conditions in the future. As mentioned during our comments, we've taken actions during the last half of 2019 to reduce our inventory position, and address the performance of our lease book. Specifically, as it relates to U.S. large ag, we entered 2020 with the lowest inventory to sales ratio over the past several years, allowing us to produce roughly in line with retail demand in this important market. For leasing, the changes we are making to our programs will enhance the long-term sustainability of our leasing business model.","Now, as we shift our focus towards 2020 and beyond, we've recently launched some key initiatives to help us better execute our strategy.","As we mentioned during the third quarter earnings call, we initiated plans to create a leaner and more efficient organization with an increased focus on the areas of our business that provide the greatest potential for differentiation -- differentiated customer value. Throughout the remainder of fiscal 2019, we completed targeted measures to streamline operations and headcount, incurring cost of $30 million. These initial actions in 2019 were the start of a broader effort to produce a more agile organization that enables quicker responses to changing market conditions. This initiative will also place a greater emphasis on the acceleration of our precision technologies and aftermarket strategies.","In line with these objectives, today, we announced a broader voluntary separation program for eligible salary employees. The cost of the fiscal year \u201820 program is approximately $140 million and contributes to an annualized savings run rate of approximately $150 million when combined with the initiatives taken in 2019. Furthermore, we are undertaking an assessment of our overseas footprint as we work to serve our customers more efficiently. We will provide updates on our plans throughout the year during our quarterly earnings calls.","As a result of these actions, we intend to drive the following outcomes. First, a streamlined organizational structure with reduced layers reset to focus on delivering technology and innovation at an increasingly rapid pace. Second, these actions will drive capital allocation decisions that further prioritize markets, products and services with the highest potential for differentiation, as well as advance our solutions offerings focused on improving customer outcomes throughout their production systems. Lastly, we\u2019ll accelerate our capture of aftermarket parts and services, leveraging our dealer channel and unique tools such as connected support and expert alerts.","In addition, we'll continue to focus on the successful integration of Wirtgen and realization of synergies while leveraging their market position and roadbuilding to offer customers a more complete solution.","As a final note, we acknowledge the uncertain environment we are operating in. However, we take these strategic measures as the beginning steps to reshape our organization and capitalize on the tremendous opportunities in front of us, particularly as it relates to precision technologies.","Josh Jepsen","Now, we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. In consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. Julie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stephen Volkmann","Hi. Good morning, guys. I guess, I'll just kick it off with a little bit of color on your ag outlook, please. So, when I look at your various geographic outlooks, mostly flat U.S., down 5, I don't come up with anything close to net sales down 5 to 10, especially with a little bit of price tailwind. So, I guess, obviously, you're under producing. I think, you may have mentioned in small ag, but I was surprised to hear you say that you think you're kind of where you need to be in large ag. It just seems like a pretty big delta between your sales and your end market forecasts. So, maybe just a little color there? Sorry for the long question.","Brent Norwood","I think, as you think about those, you're right, most geographies flat, while we're down about 5 in the U.S. and Canada. I think, what we see there is certainly the impact that was mentioned in terms of under producing on the small ag side of the business. We expect the retail environment continues to be pretty stable and that we would continue to perform well there. But, as we've gotten to better inventory levels there, we realize we can optimize those inventory levels and will under produce as a result as we make that work.","I think the other part of thinking about the range is just recognizing the uncertainty in the environment, maybe a little bit cautious as we see some of the delays related to the harvest season, pushing back some of the activity in our EOP.","John Lagemann","Yes, Josh. But, I\u2019d like to make it clear that our product portfolio has never been better. We like our go-to-market strategies and we're certainly not planning on losing any market share from that perspective. So, we feel very bullish about our share position going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","Just two questions, one on the restructuring, the $140 million, just to be clear, is that included in the net income GAAP guide and when do you expect to realize the 150 over what time frame? And then, just my second question, Josh, is on the implied decrementals for the total Company, but I guess in particular, on the ag side, they look very healthy considering the sales decline. So, I'm just trying to get comfort, with what's implied in that decremental margin? Is there restructuring, price cost, freight tailwinds from last year, if you could just give some broader color there?","Josh Jepsen","Yes, I'll start. Yes, we would say the programs that Ryan mentioned, we would have embedded in our guidance today. So, that's included in terms of the cost and the run rate savings. As you think about Ag & Turf for the next year, the big question in your comment on, are we seeing material prices, steel prices improve. We are seeing those come through and starting to improve. Now, maybe a little bit tampered by the fact that we under-produced in the back half of '19 and our production\u2019s lower going into 2020. So, not maybe as big of a benefit. But, we are seeing those prices come down.","I think, the other thing to note on, as you think about our margins is, we are seeing higher pension costs, a little bit higher incentive compensations that are impacting us, and then some overhead as we bring in new product programs. So, we introduced a couple new products at AGRITECHNICA. So, we will be -- we're in the process of bringing those in. So, there is some impact on overhead spend as we integrate those and launch those in the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","I am wondering if you could just update us on take rates for precision planting and some of the other key products. I guess, we're hearing in the field, a lot of momentum in soybeans in particular. So, it sounds like that could be a multi-hundred million dollar revenue tailwind '20 versus '19. I'm wondering if you could comment on the exact take rates, and maybe on that revenue tailwind estimate. Thanks.","Josh Jepsen","So, as mentioned by John, we've seen continued growth there. So, if you look at ExactEmerge, for example, we were around 30% last year. That number\u2019s in the upper 30s, near 40 as we come through the early order program. And I think, this past season, the challenges with the wet conditions has been the best test case for why that technology is particularly valuable in the shorter windows that we need to execute those jobs is really, really important. ExactApply, we're seeing kind of very similar take rates to a year ago, which you\u2019re talking about in the 40s. And then Combine Advisor, we moved into base equipment. So, that's a significant move, if you think about the duration in which we've seen that adapt very quickly. So, that's three years to go in base. And so, we feel really good about that.","On top of that what we're seeing from our tractors is on our some of our precision packages that our tractors can take, we've seen pretty significant growth. So, our 8R tractor has seen a jump to about 50% take rate on our CommandCenter AutoTrac guidance, which includes RowSense and some other functions. So, we're seeing that really across the portfolio. Anything you\u2019d mention, John?","John Lagemann","Yes. I\u2019d just like to augment. This last year, the weather, I've never seen the weather conditions more adverse and really more unpredictable. And the ExactEmerge technology proved to be really a game changer. When you consider that -- one or two days could make a difference, whether a guy got his crop in or not. And it really proved itself. And then, I think on the Combine Advisor, if you think about some of the conditions that they face this fall, I think the ability to set those settings and then have them automatically set in the field proved to be really, really valuable. And then, on the premium activations, Josh, I think that just shows the precision piece of the technology here and how important that is, when you consider inch by inch accuracy. But, this year has proven to be a very solid year from a way to augment what they really do.","Ryan Campbell","Jerry, it\u2019s Ryan. Just a quick thought on that. It took over a decade for us to move AutoTrac from a feature and option into base machines. As we think about adoption of precision technologies, some perspective, Combine Advisor, this is year three. And we're moving it into base.","Josh Jepsen","The only other thing I'd add there on the precision side is, we're seeing continued growth in engaged acres. So, we are north of $165 million engaged acres. So, that is that has grown and not just in North America, but we're seeing that grow overseas as well. Brazil's a market where we've seen significant growth there. So, we feel really good about the trajectory of those take rates, particularly as we introduce those features in other geographies like South America, but on top of that, what we're seeing from the ops center and folks engaging with those digital tools to plan, monitor and analyze their operations.","Jerry Revich","Thank you. ","Josh Jepsen","Thanks. We'll go to our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.","Rob Wertheimer","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just one quick one on the voluntary separation. That is I guess, more U.S. based than international if I understand correctly. The future costs out that you'll work through and talk to the rest of the year is more on the international side. And then, I know it's hard to talk about things that are cost related but will that put you in a good position or is this a multiyear journey that you're kicking off on cost?","Josh Jepsen","Yes, Rob. Thanks for the question. I'd say, this is -- this certainly is strategic in nature, and I'd say, not a one or two-quarter event. So, I think over time, we'll continue kind of executing on this path in terms of looking at our cost structure, but then also how do we best and most efficiently serve our customers all over the world. So, I think, we\u2019ll -- as we continue to execute on the plans, as Ryan mentioned, we're undergoing assessment, we\u2019ll provide updates, but I think that's a little bit.","Ryan Campbell","Hey, Rob, it's Ryan. This is -- I would view it as a journey to reshape our portfolio and our business towards the areas that we've talked about with respect to where we can differentiate more than potentially other areas. And that's really with production systems, agriculture, precision agriculture and aftermarket.","Josh Jepsen","Thank you, Rob. We'll go ahead to our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is open. ","MigDobre","Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone. I just want to go back to Steve's initial question on your Ag & Turf outlook. I guess, I'm having a bit of a hard time understanding exactly what's implied in terms of inventory destocking for the smaller equipment. Can you maybe put this in perspective? I mean, from what I recall, this is less than half the overall segment and we're talking about $1.5 billion plus worth of a headwind, at least on my math in 2020. And correct me if I'm wrong, and why is this happening now? And again, some framework and some context would be helpful.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. Thanks, Mig. I think, when you think about that, I mean, we are seeing the large ag market come down. So, it's not small ag alone. So, we are seeing top line there. The benefit of the actions we took last year is we're able to produce in line with that retail demand. So, that's positive, but still it's at a lower level. As you think about the small ag side, and what we're doing there on the under production to pull those inventory levels down. That's really as we think about where do we need to be in the selling season, and what are those inventory to sales ratios. And roughly, we're talking about probably about a 10-point reduction of those inventory-to-sales ratios on where we want to be. So, there's some movement there, but that is that is the biggest portion of the underproduction.","Mig Dobre","And Josh, is this in under 40 horsepower tractors specifically?","Josh Jepsen","No, I\u2019d say more broadly. So, essentially 100 horsepower and below. So, you're talking about compact utilities plus utilities.","John Lagemann","We\u2019ve made some pretty significant improvements to the overall order fulfillment process on small tractors. And, frankly, with those changes, we're confident that we can bring the inventory down, as you mentioned. So, I think, it's a combination of factors.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research.","Joe O'Dea","With respect to the 15% segment margin targets, can you talk about the bridge to those targets at this point? How much of that is volume dependent? How much of that is things that you control?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. So, I think, first and foremost those are things that we're working on regardless of end markets, and that's precision ag, after market opportunities, it\u2019s activities on the cost structure, it's executing and integrating Wirtgen and our synergies there. So, those are I\u2019d say the big piece of where we see the margin improvement coming from. As we think about what does the end market do, we're not contemplating a huge swing back in terms of improvement, for example, for large ag.","Joe O'Dea","And so just following up on that. I mean, you're down this year I would say 2018, 2019 probably more reflective of normalized demand. So, those 15% margin targets, really with respect to normalized demand, and so, this year would be below that, just 2020 would be below that. Just to be clear.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. Our math would put as just below 90% of mid cycle from an ag perspective overall.","Operator","Next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities.","Andy Casey","Question on the 2020 outlook, should we think that it is more truncated to the second half than usual? Because it kind of sounds like you expect demand to start out slowly, it's probably going to take some time to realize the benefits from the voluntary separation to kick in, and then you have comps that should get a little bit easier in the second half, given the inventory correction that you did this year.","Josh Jepsen","Andy, that's fair. I would say, there's more of that impact in the first part of the year, certainly as you think about some of the costs, so the under production. And you're right, the comps would get a -- would be more favorable in the back part of the year where we did significant under production in 2019 in large ag.","Ryan Campbell","Andy, the voluntary separation costs will be incurred in the first quarter. The benefit obviously will go throughout the year and then full year run rate benefits will be in the following year.","Andy Casey","And then, a follow-up, just a clarification on the series 8R production starting in Q3. Does that impact the first half production rates at all for the existing 8R?","Josh Jepsen","We're effectively -- I mean, we've got the schedule laid out and we've sold out, as Brent mentioned in his comments or John mentioned, we've sold out that that level of production that we have. So that's full. So, it really doesn't impact what we would execute on in the first half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher","Just a couple of things on the construction side of the business. What is your retail expectation for 2020, if I missed it? And how is the 1% price assumption for \u201820 compared to what you achieved in '19? And then, just wondering to what extent you're starting to see any competitive pricing in the segment as things start to soften there?","Josh Jepsen","Thanks, Steve. Yes. So, when you think about C&F on price, as we talked about, or it was in our press release, we're expecting about a point of price in 2020 that compares to about 3 in 2019. And as we discussed throughout this year, C&F did 3 for the full year. That was much more front-end loaded where we took some price actions at the end of '18 and the early '19. So, we saw a lot of that come through in the early part of the year. But strong price performance, given where we\u2019ve been.","Now, certainly that\u2019s a market where we always watch what's going on, understand not necessarily the price leader. So, we'll continue to monitor what we're seeing going on from a competitive perspective. But, we think we're able to deliver that 1%, which is a good thing for that business.","Steven Fisher","And the retail expectation overall for construction in 2020?","Josh Jepsen","Yes, sorry. Yes. We expect retail to be down around 5%. And certainly, as was noted, we will do some underproduction, a mid-single-digit underproduction in construction in North America as we align inventories in that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI.","David Raso","First, a clarification, maybe I missed it. Ag & Turf high horsepower, did you under produce retail in the second half of '19? I know we\u2019ve talked about that a quarter or so ago. Was that the case?","Josh Jepsen","We did. So for the full year, we talked about -- a quarter ago, we said we were going to -- for the full year high horsepower North America, we under produce at mid-single-digit. We actually ended up under producing by high-single-digit as a result of executing the production plans but then also strong retail to close out the year.","David Raso","That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to understand. If you're producing at retail next year and you think high horsepower is generally, okay, I mean, I know it\u2019s within the guide of down 5% for U.S., Canada, that would sound more on the smaller side. I'm trying to understand why your production want to be up a year following you're under producing, because it puts even more pressure on the amount of under production and the low horsepower to make the math work. Can you just square that up for us? If you're producing at retail for a higher horsepower in '20, wouldn\u2019t your production be up from '19?","Josh Jepsen","I think -- so, retailer is lower, first off, if we go from \u201819, \u201820, retail is lower and we're going to produce to that level. But that level is lower than where we would have been in -- that level is lower, just when we compare the years '19 to '20. So, we're going to produce in line, even after the underproduction that we did in '19.","David Raso","But, if you\u2019re under producing by high-single-digit in '19, even if retails down 3 or 4 in high horsepower, your production would be up, because you were under producing more a year ago. I think we're just putting a lot of pressure on a huge under production and low horsepower to make this math logical. And I just want to make sure we level set. Your high horsepower production would appear to be up in your retail environment, coming off how you under produced. I mean, that's just the math. I'm just making sure I understand we all level set leaving the call.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. What I\u2019d tell you is we are -- the lower retail that we see in '20 versus '19, producing at that is still at a lower level than what we saw in fiscal '19.","David Raso","Okay. We can talk offline. And lastly, the cadence of how you see the sales playing out for the year, I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but any sense of the cadence of the implied total sales down about 9, how do you see it or even break it up by segment, whatever you choose to... ","Josh Jepsen","I mean, I think when you think about '20, it\u2019s probably a little bit lighter in the first half as we talked about, we got some of the under production, some of the things on small ag, small tractors in particular that impact the first half of the year. So, I'd say a little bit lighter first half versus second half.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Gupta with Stephens. Your line is open. ","Ashish Gupta","Thanks so much. I have a question and a clarification. Do you think there's a demand pull forward for the 8R, resulting in the sellout? And then, just to clarify in the large tractor order book, I think last year in the fourth quarter -- on this call you said it was -- the large tractor order book was extended versus last year. I thought last year you said it was out through the fiscal second quarter, and I think you'd said through March this year. So if you could just clarify that\u2019d be great.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. So, I think we would say, there's an impact of the model changeover certainly. And I think, that\u2019s -- Brent and John have commented on that in terms of -- that has impacted where orders are and we're not taking orders. So, certainly, we do expect some orders that come in on the existing model. So, I think that's the component. As you think about where we are in relation to last year, 8000 series, 9000 series, we're a month to two months further out in terms of availability. But that can be variable on what the underlying production schedule, right. So, that's not absolute when we compare those. But we are further out. We have more visibility this year than we do -- than we did a year ago at this time.","John Lagemann","Josh -- and as we planned our transition strategy, we had intended to do this to sell out the current model and then transition into the new model. And I can tell you that there's demand on the current model since it's sold out. But there's a lot of excitement on the new ones. So, actually, the transition is going just as we had planned.","Ashish Gupta","And then, sorry, just a quick follow up. So, I think he had said that you expect some downtime in the third quarter related to the model changeover. So, should we expect production to be lower in some Q versus -- is there going to be different seasonality?","Josh Jepsen","I mean, there's probably a little bit of impact, but I don't think it's significant. I wouldn\u2019t say significant as that changeover happens, really kind of at the end of our second quarter into the beginning of our third. So, I wouldn't think it would impact meaningfully our kind of seasonal shift there or seasonal split.","Operator","Yes. Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Seth Weber","On construction, maybe just on the Wirtgen business, it sounds like you're messaging that it's really the U.S. business that's going to be weaker. But, it feels like Wirtgen has been a little bit softer than we expected. I mean, can you just give us kind of a walk around and what you're seeing in the regions for the Wirtgen business? And, you kind of alluded to margins being above segment average, but our margins kind of where you would expect them to be at this point, or are you pushing -- still pushing synergies there? Is there still more upside on margins to come? Thanks.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. I mean, certainly we think the opportunity on synergies is yet to come. There's a lot of work and we feel good about that \u20ac125 million. But we're not -- we haven't seen a lot of that making its way through from a margin perspective yet. What I would say is some of those synergies are having some impact. A good example is, we talked about this year of integrating order fulfillment. So, this year, Wirtgen did do some underproduction on some Wirtgen models as well as V\u00f6gele models, which have been impactful in terms of their margin performance. So, that's impacted their margin as we did do some underproduction to right size inventory there in some models and some markets. So, there --- that had an impact on Wirtgen margins for the year.","I think as you look around the globe there, North America has been pretty steady from a roadbuilding perspective. Europe has been relatively stable, kind of flat, maybe a little bit of caution in a market like the UK on Brexit. I think, if you look at emerging markets and other markets, that's probably where we've seen more of a weakness, China, we've talked about places like Argentina, Turkey where we've seen more incremental weakness. So, still feel really good about the business, really good about the integration and the synergy opportunities and continue to find more opportunities to leverage and work together. So, we'd say on track, certainly we took some steps with the underproduction this year and we've got some factory startup going on that's driven some inefficiencies but feel good about the future there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley.","Courtney Yakavonis","I appreciate the color you gave on some of the steps you\u2019re taking on the finco to reduce losses on operating leases. But can you just talk a little bit about how much you adjusted down the low residual values? And also, it sounded like this was primarily in ag -- primarily in the ag division, but, was there any impact on C&F operating leases residual values? And then, also, was any of this equipment with precision ag or any of the more advanced features or is this some of just an aging effect?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. Thanks Courtney. I'll start there. I mean, I think, if you think about, as our lease terms have gotten longer, they tend to be in between three and four years. So, you've got a little bit -- a little bit, you\u2019re not talking about brand new equipment. As you think about which division, if we see -- we saw it across both divisions, and maybe if you just go back to -- we made some changes to our lease book in 2016, where we reduced residual values, we encourage longer term leases, and we saw some of that benefit. We saw the benefit in '17, we saw in '18 as well. As we got into the latter half of '19, we saw kind of the market uncertainty impacting the recovery rates as we were remarketing this equipment back through the wholesale channel. So, that resulted in some of the impairment that we disclosed, and then the changes that John mentioned today. So, there's been a combination of those things that have impacted this, but we have seen it in both divisions. So, it's not a just one division or the other.","John Lagemann","But we have not made major changes to the RVs. I mean, we've tweaked it a little bit to fit the market, but not major changes.","Courtney Yakavonis","And then, just on the comments that you're rolling Combine Advisor into your pricing, I think you gave a 2% pricing forecast for A&T. How should we be thinking about that? Is that like for like equipment, or will there still be an additional mix impact from something like Combine Advisor that\u2019s not necessarily an upsell anymore?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. In its first year when it moves in base, it'll still be coming through mix, not in our price realization number. It would not have been in the comparable model last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan.","Ann Duignan","If I could ask why the strong dollar is not listed as one of the headwind facing U.S. agriculture, but I'm not going to ask that. I'm going to ask, why were you overproducing in the small horsepower sector in the -- under horsepower? And how much inventory do you have to reduce now that you've spent your overproducing?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. And I would say, I think, as we look at that business, we were building inventory to get to a desired inventory level to meet really retail demand and meet the needs of those customers. The way those customers by those is, effectively on impulse. You walk into a dealership on a Saturday, you want to walk away with a tractor that day. So over the last couple years, we've been growing to get to that sustained inventory to sales level. And I think as John mentioned earlier, as we look at that, and we've gotten to that level, we've identified opportunities really to optimize those levels of inventory while still being able to meet the customer needs. So it's really about us getting a little more efficient and having a little bit better information as we've gotten to those levels to be able to execute. Anything you\u2019d mention John?","John Lagemann","Yes. And once again, we made and we made some pretty significant improvements to the overall order fulfillment process. So we're confident we can respond quicker to retail demand. So, I think the word optimization is spot on, Josh. ","Operator","Next question comes from Tim Thein. Your line is open with Citigroup.","Tim Thein","John, wondering, is there a way to quantify how much -- for Ag & Turf, how much of the forecast is made up essentially of your own estimates versus orders in hand. And in the spirit of the question is, normally at this time, just given the delayed harvest, presumably there's less of dealer -- visibility that dealer has and in turn that you have. So, is there a way to just quantify, again, I think it's ballpark numbers in terms of at this point in the year we normally have x percent visibility, and thus the balance is just our own estimate in terms of how order rates play out over the coming months.","Josh Jepsen","Yes. I think I'll start, this is Josh. I think, certainly, the weather and the delayed harvest has impacted EOP combines in particular, certainly -- we would acknowledge, we have less visibility there because of the delayed seasonality that we're seeing. And that\u2019s led us to probably be a little more cautious in terms of how we're viewing the market and our overall guide as a result of that. Now, I think tractors good visibility, as we mentioned, really driven more by some of the changeover in product. But those are the key things I would mention. I'll ask John to add in.","John Lagemann","I'd like to repeat the comment I made in my opening comments that with this weather situation being so unique, there's a pretty good possibility that our early order program on combines will be back ended. We don't know that yet. So, that's why we're a little cautious, but we think there's a good chance of that as farmers complete their harvest and assess their income situation, we think there could be some year-end buying, but we don't know that yet.","Tim Thein","And maybe just while you\u2019re there, John, a quick follow up. In terms of you mentioned earlier, from a standpoint of replacement demand and the fleet being the oldest it\u2019s been in a while. And I'm assuming this weather that you're talking that we're seeing is putting some additional pressure on the fleet. Are you seeing that manifested in terms of higher reconditioning bills and service and parts activity and dealers in terms of maybe a bit more visibility that you have that maybe we are getting closer to the point where you're going to see more need based buying or is it just more anecdotal?","John Lagemann","Yes. I think that's a great question. And in fact, we are seeing good growth in the aftermarket. Our dealers are reporting part sales growth, absorption growth, et cetera. So we are seeing some larger bills as they come through the system. And we think our connected support approach that that Ryan alluded to, we think that's going to really help the dealer be proactive with some of those service opportunities. So, yes, as the fleet ages, we are seeing some pretty good sales growth on the aftermarket side of the business.","Josh Jepsen","All right. Thanks, Tim. We'll go ahead to our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ross Gilardi","Good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask another question about Combine Advisor and making that a standard option, only after three years, which you're doing at the same time, the Phase 1 of your order book is down double digits. And what I'm trying to get at is, is there a risk, this is a very short term decision that's going to remove your ability to go back and price in the future for this pretty valuable option when the market recovers. And this is a reality that you're going to have to give away a lot of these technologies in the base model to drive adoption, particularly as some of your competitors seem to be stepping up their game and really focusing a lot more heavily on precision agriculture?","Josh Jepsen","Yes. I think, maybe one thing there to call out is when something used in the base, it's not free. When a feature moves into base, base price moves up with it. So we don't give up that pricing opportunity or margin that goes with that.","John Lagemann","And we were seeing tank rates increase to the point where we needed to do that because it's a fundamental improvement to the overall combine, the way it functions. So, we think that's a positive, the way we\u2019ve transitioned that into base so quickly.","Josh Jepsen","We\u2019re at the top of the hour. So, that'll be our last question. We appreciate all the interest. And we'll be around to handle questions. Thanks, everyone. Happy Thanksgiving.","Operator","Thank you for your participation.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tony Huegel, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.","Tony Huegel","Thank you, Dexter. Also on the call today are Raj Kalathur, our Chief Financial Officer and Josh Jepsen, our Manager Investor Communications.

Josh?","Joshua Jepsen","Thank you, Tony. John Deere\u2019s performance for the second quarter and first six months reflected the continuing impact of the downturn in the global farm economy as well as weakness in markets for construction equipment. Nevertheless all our businesses remained profitable. They benefitted from the sound execution of our operating plans, the strength of our broad product portfolio, and our success establishing a more flexible cost structure. You may have also noticed that we\u2019ve made changes in our outlook for sales and profits for the full year.","Now let\u2019s take a closer look at our second quarter results beginning on slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 4% to $7.875 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $495 million. EPS was $1.56 in the quarter.","On slide four, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 4% to $7.1 billion. That\u2019s better than our previous net sales guidance of down about 8%. The higher sales in the quarter were largely due to timing differences of shipments between quarters mainly attributable to agriculture and turf equipment in North America and Brazil. Price realization in the quarter was positive by one point. Currency translation was negative by two points.","Turning to our review of our individual businesses, let\u2019s start with agriculture and turf on slide 5. Net sales were flat in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Foreign currency exchange had a negative impact on sales with the biggest impact coming from the Brazilian Real. Partially offsetting this was positive price realization. Operating profit was $614 million down from $639 million last year. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, lower shipment volumes, and a less favorable product mix. These factors were partially offset by price realization, lower production cost, and lower selling, administrative, and general expenses.","Before we review the industry sales outlook let's look at the fundamentals affecting the Ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the record crop harvests of the last three years and the resulting lower commodity prices, our estimates for 2015 cash receipts remains down about 10% from 2014 peak levels. Our 2016 forecast contemplates total cash receipts to be about $375 billion down only slightly from 2015.","On slide 7, grain stocks to use ratios remained at somewhat sensitive levels even after the abundant harvest of the past three years. Global grain and oil seed demand continues to be strong while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tensions could result in prices quickly moving higher.","Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on slide 8. Modest economic growth is continuing, however, the region is experiencing continued geopolitical risks such as the upcoming Brexit referendum. Farm income remains below the long-term average and weakness persists in the dairy sector. As a result we\u2019re expecting lower industry farm machinery demand in the EU region.","On slide 9 you will see the economic fundamentals outlined for China and India. Due to the economic slowdown in China, we continue to anticipate lower industry sales. Although the government continues to be supportive of the agriculture sector recent policy changes related to corn floor prices, reduction of corn stock piles, and a less stringent position on grains self sufficiency are causing short-term uncertainty for both domestic and global markets.","Turning to India, the economy is growing, outpacing other emerging markets and foreign investment is returning. The government continues providing assistance to the Ag sector with programs such as minimum support prices for commodities, irrigation, and crop insurance. Lastly, the upcoming monsoon is expected to provide above average moisture after two years of below normal seasons. These factors are resulting in improved industry demand in India.","Shifting to Brazil, slide 10 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production a good proxy for the health of the Agri business there. Ag production is expected to decrease about 2% in 2016 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. The situation is more positive in local currency as Brazilian farmer profitability remains at good levels as crops are sold in dollars. Although Ag fundamentals remain positive, farmer confidence is low due to economic and political concerns as well as growing inflation, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales.","The political landscape is shifting with the recent impeachment vote of the Brazilian President and the new administration taking shape. This includes the appointment of an agriculture minister with strong ties to farming and Agri business. Though it\u2019s too soon to draw conclusions, the agricultural sector seems encouraged by these changes.","Staying in Brazil, slide 11 illustrates the finance rates for Ag equipment. Brazil recently announced details of eligible rates for government-sponsored finance programs. They apply to the upcoming budget year which runs from July 2016 through June 2017. Rates for Moderfrota will increase from 7.5% to 8.5% for small and mid-size farmers and from 9% to 10.5% for large farmers. While the rates are being increased, it\u2019s important to note they remain below the level of inflation in Brazil. This announcement is a positive sign. It removes an element of uncertainty for farmers and conveys confidence the government will continue to support agriculture in spite of the economic and political challenges in Brazil.","Our 2016 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on slide 12. Low commodity prices, stagnant farm incomes, and elevated used equipment levels in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment. The decline is most pronounced in the sale of high horsepower models. Our forecast for industry sales in the U.S. and Canada remains down 15% to 20%, with large Ag equipment sales down 25% to 30%.","The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5% in 2016, due to low crop prices and farm incomes as well as continued pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 15% to 20% in 2016, a result of the downturn in Brazil and other commodity-driven economies in the region. Shifting to Asia, sales are expected to be flat to down slightly primarily due to weakness in China.","Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016. Putting this altogether on slide 13, fiscal year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 8%. This includes about two points of negative currency translation. The improvement in our forecast is driven almost entirely by foreign currency exchange. Ag & Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 7% in 2016, unchanged from the previous forecast. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 28%.","Now let\u2019s focus on construction and forestry on slide 14. Net sales were down 16% in the quarter as a result of lower shipment volumes and higher sales incentive costs. Operating profit was $74 million in the quarter, down from a $189 million last year. The decrease was driven by lower shipment volumes, higher sales incentive costs, and an unfavorable product mix. These were partially offset by lower production costs and lower selling, administrative, and general expenses. The higher sales incentive costs are reflective of the highly competitive environment in North America. The division\u2019s decremental margins was about 43%.","Moving to slide 15, looking at the economic indicators of the bottom part of the slide, growth in construction spending less energy and GDP are both positive, and how these starts are expected to be just below 1.2 million units this year. In spite of these encouraging signs, the industry continued operating at a slow pace. Contributing factors are rental utilization rates continue to decline. Weak conditions persist in the energy sector. Used equipment is readily available and continues to be redeployed from energy producing regions to other parts of the country.","The mix of housing starts in the U.S. is skewed to multifamily homes requiring less earth moving equipment and economic growth outside the U.S. is sluggish. As a result Deere\u2019s construction and forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 13% in 2016. The change from our previous forecast is largely driven by lower sales in the United States and Canada and the impact of higher sales incentive costs. The forecast for global forestry markets remains down 5% to 10% from the strong levels we experienced in recent years primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 6%, the implied decremental margin for the year is about 32%.","Let's move now to our financial services operations. Slide 16 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. At the end of April, it was 17 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The forecast for 2016 now contemplates a loss provision of about 23 basis points. The change from our previous guidance is related to our C&F retail note and agriculture revolving credit portfolios. Despite the increase, this would still put Deere\u2019s losses below the 10 year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15 year average of 39 basis points.","Moving to slide 17, Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $103 million in the second quarter versus $170 million last year. The lower results were primarily due to higher losses on lease residual values, less favorable financing spreads, and a higher provision for credit losses. 2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $480 million. The outlook reflects the same factors cited for the quarter namely less favorable financing spreads, higher losses on lease residual values, and an increased provision for credit losses. Also remember that 2015 results benefitted from a gain on the sale of crop insurance business of about $30 million.","Before we move on to receivables and inventory let's discuss the losses on residual values noted in the earnings release. The losses in the quarter were primarily related to impairments on both construction and agricultural equipment operating leases with construction accounting for more than half of the amount. While short-term leases of 12 months or less make up only 15% to 20% of the operating lease portfolio, they account for over 60% of the impairment charges in the quarter.","Recent experience has seen both a higher rate of matured lease inventory being returned to John Deere Financial in addition to higher loss rates upon the remarketing of these lease returns. We\u2019ve taken a number of actions to mitigate risk on our operating lease portfolio, a few examples include lowering residual values for future leases most heavily impacting short-term leases, significantly restricting our short-term lease offerings, and increasing risk sharing with dealers.","Slide 18 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $381 million. For the quarter timing of shipments impacted the Ag and turf division. We expect to end 2016 with total receivables and inventory down about $400 million with reductions from both divisions. The change in the forecast for Ag and turf is largely driven by foreign currency exchange. Field inventory to sales ratios for new large Ag equipment are expected to end the year in line with 2015 year-end levels, which is consistent with our previous forecast.","Our 2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on slide 19, is about 79% unchanged from the last quarter. When modeling 2016 keep these unfavorable impacts in mind, unfavorable product mix, tier 4 product cost, and overhead spend. On the favorable side we expect price realization of about one point, favorable raw material costs, lower pension and OPEB expense, and lower incentive compensation expense.","Now let\u2019s look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D expense on slide 20, R&D was up 1% in the second quarter. Our 2016 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1% with approximately one point of negative currency translation. Moving now to slide 21, SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 5% in the second quarter with currency translation, pension and OPEB and incentive compensation accounting for nearly all the change.","Turning to slide 22, our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 4%. The same factor cited for the quarter account for about seven points of the full year change. Turning to slide 23; pension and OPEB expense was down $50 million for the quarter and is forecast to be down about $200 million for the full year, unchanged from the previous forecast. On slide 24, the equipment operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter, primarily due to discrete items. For 2016, the full year effective tax rate is now forecast to be in the range of 31% to 33%.","Slide 25 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. The forecast for cash flow from the equipment operations is about $2.1 billion in 2016. The company\u2019s third quarter financial outlook is on slide 26. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 12% compared with 2015. This includes about two points of price realization and unfavorable currency translation of about one point. Turning to slide 27 in the full year outlook, our forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 9%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about one point. The reduction in price realization guidance is mostly in response to competitive pressures in the C&F division. Currency translation is negative by about two points. Finally, our full year 2016 net income forecast is now about $1.2 billion.","In summary, there's little question that Deere will face challenging conditions for the rest of the year. Even so, it is noteworthy the company is continuing to perform at a much higher level than we've done in previous downturns. This is due in large part to our success in developing a more durable business model and a broader range of revenue sources. What's more, the company\u2019s financial condition remains strong. In fact we believe Deere is well-positioned to capitalize on attractive growth opportunities that will deliver value to our customers and investors in the future. Meanwhile on the cost side, we're continuing to look for ways to streamline our operations and make them even more efficient and profitable. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tony.","Tony Huegel","Thank you, Josh. Now we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. In consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question and that includes no multiple-part questions. If you have additional questions we ask that you rejoin the queue. Dexter?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. So we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Andy Casey of Wells Fargo. You may now ask your question.","Andrew Casey ","Thanks, good morning. Question on the guidance, I'm trying to understand the components of the $100 million net income guidance reduction, the tax rate down kind of more than offsets the $45 million down in credit. Can you kind of run through the other factors driving net income guidance decrease because it doesn\u2019t really look like the operating profit post corporate really changed that much?","Tony Huegel ","Sure. And yes, there's a lot of moving pieces and I know you all love when I point out rounding. But truly again this quarter there is rounding. I\u2019ll point out a few of those specifically. As you think about Ag & Turf in the rounding there, we talk about a 7% operating margin, understand that is rounding up. So you\u2019re actually let's say you are closer to a 6.5 and you are 7. And similarly construction is also rounding up. So as we point out, the 6% it\u2019s really closer to 5.5%. And I would point out as well, the 1.2 billion in income is also a rounded number and, in this case it is actually rounding down a little bit. So to your point if you look at some of those moving pieces, when you think about construction, when you think about some of the positive as well as is financial services coming down, you don\u2019t necessarily see a full $100 million. And I would point out as you look at the change in our internal forecast for net income it wouldn\u2019t be a full $100 million reduction either. It is just a way of rounding looks it does go to the full $100 million.","So again you are right in the sense that obviously you are seeing some negatives from financial services. That income is obviously lower. The other larger item that did reduce in the quarter is around construction and forestry and as you think about that sales change, a good portion of that relates to pricing and with competitive pressures that we have seen our price realization has come down. Actually I will tell you it is slightly negative in our forecast today. And remember as we reduced pricing, that drops right to the bottom line and so that does have a greater impact on the profitability of that particular division. Those are the major moving pieces.","Andrew Casey ","Okay, so it\u2019s not really related to other expense because that was considerably higher?","Joshua Jepsen","Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. Okay, thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. You may now ask your question.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. I guess just a couple of questions, Tony I think you guys covered the finance sub in your prepared remarks but could you just give a little more color you said you changed some of your assumptions on residual values on risk sharing agreements with dealers, so can you give color exactly on what you did there and your confidence level that this isn't the first step I guess more to come? Thanks.","Joshua Jepsen","Sure, yeah, and certainly I can't get too specific on the details of what we have done again just from a competitive perspective. We try to be cautious around that. But I think maybe to put some of this in context, remember the two key drivers when you think about operating leases and the gains or losses on the return of matured lease inventory there is really two factors that we tend to focus on; what's the rate of return? So how much of that equipment actually comes back to John Deere Financial. And in this case as we talked about we\u2019re seeing on short-term leases a much higher return rate than the average portfolio. So more of that equipment is coming back to John Deere Financial for disposition.","And then the second factor is now what of those that come back how much can you sell that for versus what the residual value is. And again on the shorter-term leases we\u2019re seeing a higher level of loss generally on the disposition of that equipment. So those are that -- a lot of the work we\u2019ve done is around how do we shore up and reduce the risk around those short-term leases. And so obviously as Josh talked about in the opening comments, it's around residual values, changing those, again bringing in more risk, sharing with the dealers. In fact I would tell you on some of the used equipment short-term leases, those 12 months leases dealers today effectively are guaranteeing the residual value in terms of if we are going to write a 12 month lease on used Ag equipment.","So, those are some of the changes that we would have made but again it\u2019s with the focus on how do we reduce some of that risk primarily around the short-term portion of the business. So we\u2019ll see as we move forward. Again we are doing a lot of work around how do we reduce the return rate going forward doing some advanced marketing with our dealers and customers to again see more of that matured lease inventory stay with either of the customer or the dealer, not get put back on John Deere Financial, as well as exploring a part of that, how can we dispose of that equipment more profitably. So we\u2019ll see as we move forward but those would be the two areas I would point out.","As much as I\u2019d love to say we've captured it all and there's really no risk going forward, the change in the return rate as well as the loss rates are going to be the two factors we're looking at internally. And that I would point out has a risk of getting worse. It also has the opportunity to get better if some of these activities do actually work out and we're able to reduce those two factors. So again, hopefully, a little bit more color that helps provide some idea of what we're doing there. Thank you. Next caller?","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Tony Huegel ","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research Company. You may now ask your question.","Adam Uhlman","Hi, guys. Good morning. On raw material costs, I guess you had mentioned that you expect that to be favorable for the year but we've seen steel prices move higher quite a bit recently. And so I'm wondering at what point in the year, in your model, does this start to become unfavorable, is that going to start in the fourth quarter as we expect that in the first quarter of next year, maybe talk through that?","Tony Huegel","That\u2019s a good point and I would point out certainly we would describe steel prices today as very volatile. As you pointed out we've seen steel prices increase pretty dramatically here in the last several months, started really with some spikes in pricing in China. I'd note that actually in the Chinese market the pricing\u2019s come down pretty dramatically again. So there are a lot of people who would argue that the high level they\u2019re at today is likely to come off of that pricing. Again, not that we're saying it\u2019s likely to come back down well below the $400 range either on some of the steel pricing. Candidly the steel mills at that level are largely unprofitable. So we would expect it to settle back a bit.","Now for Deere, to get specific to your question, we would point out our risk is mostly in our fourth quarter, the way our contracts are set up. We don\u2019t have a lot of risk through third quarter, but going into fourth quarter, and then of course what that means for fiscal 2017 depending on where the steel prices settle in, could have some impact next year as well. So again it\u2019s a little premature, given the volatility to talk much about what 2017 might look like but for us the risk is fourth quarter. And I\u2019d point out it\u2019s a relatively low steel purchasing quarter for us. So minimal impact on 2016, more risk in 2017. Okay. Thank you. Next caller?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question.","Jerry Revich","Hi, good morning everyone. Tony, can you talk about the pace of operating lease growth for used equipment in Ag for you from here? I think last year was one of the bigger levers that you folks used to bring down used equipment inventories in the channel and I'm wondering if this year you're expecting a similar contribution? Have your plans there changed at all post the adjustment this quarter? Thanks.","Tony Huegel","Yeah, again, I think the easiest way to answer that is it will depend on what our customer preferences are as we -\u2013 as our dealers seek to move that equipment, and I\u2019ll point out again as I have in the past, when you think about leasing versus retail notes, our preference candidly would always be a retail note versus an operating lease. But if our customer\u2019s preference is to have an operating lease then we\u2019ll certainly consider that.","Now as I mentioned earlier, from a short-term perspective and specifically I'm talking about 12-month leases, we've done a number of -\u2013 made a number of changes that make those short-term leases candidly much less attractive. And in terms of some of the residual value changes that we would point out, it\u2019s really setting those residual values at a level that\u2019s more appropriate for the type of experience we're seeing today on the disposition of the matured lease inventory. So going forward certainly if a customer has a preference towards a longer-term lease when they\u2019re looking to buy used equipment, we would continue to look to offer that lease option from a financing perspective. I think there's a little bit of misunderstanding or information in the marketplace around the level of leasing too. I\u2019ve heard numbers as high as 50% is going into operating lease today. We would tell you year-to-date if you look at operating leases versus retail note its closer to a quarter of the volume is operating lease. Now again to be fair that is higher than what it would have been historically, but it is nowhere near that half type of range that some are talking about.","Jerry Revich","Thanks Tony, and that half is not from us, we appreciate it.","Tony Huegel","Thank you, next caller.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. You may now ask your question.","Ross Gilardi","Thanks Tony, so what are the factors that actually got you to flat year-on-year revenue in Ag and yet you\u2019re implying an 11% revenue decline in the second half of 2016. So what's going on there?","Tony Huegel","Sure, last quarter our sales came in a little lighter for the first quarter than what we had forecast and we talked about there that was largely a shift of production from first quarter into second quarter. So we anticipated second quarter being a little higher and I would tell you the opposite happened this quarter. We actually also saw in addition to the first quarter shipments moving into second pulling forward a little bit of the production from third quarter which is why again when you think about our agricultural Ag and turf division we really didn\u2019t see a change. When you back out FX didn\u2019t see a change in the sales impact. It is really just shifting between quarters and that\u2019s largely what drove those higher sales in the second quarter.","Ross Gilardi","Thanks.","Tony Huegel","Yes, thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan of JP Morgan. You may now ask your question.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning.","Joshua Jepsen","Hi, Ann.","Ann Duignan","Hi, I am struggling a little bit to understand your strategy on the agricultural side. If I look at industry data, there are about 15,000 used Deere over 100 horsepower tractors for sale and yet inventories of new equipment are now at 37% of trailing 12 month sales, almost double a year ago. So can you talk to us a little bit about what is your strategy on the used equipment side, how do you help dealers get rid of that used equipment? Thank you.","Joshua Jepsen","Actually, I\u2019ll loop back around to used, but I want to address the new inventory because I think that is maybe as relevant as anything that you pointed out there. In the sense that I think you are looking at the AEM data that\u2019s in the appendix. I would point out that 100 horsepower and above, so that\u2019s a wider range than what we would consider large equipment. We would start at 220 horsepower as large Ag equipment and very specifically that 100 horsepower, 100 to 200 horsepower range is mostly for us to be our 6000 series tractors. I would point out that those 6000 series tractors come from Germany and as a result they aren't a build to retail order type of product as our large equipment large tractors would be in the U.S. and Canada. So you do get some shifts timing wise from that perspective.","I'd also point out similar to the previous question, we did have some higher level of shipments in the third quarter even on the larger equipment so there is some timing difference there as well. Maybe most importantly as we think about year-end, again think about the quarter-end as a timing issue in terms of inventory in the field of new equipment. When you look forward, what's in our forecast today assuming our retail sales forecast is accurate and our shipment forecast is accurate, we will end the year with that 100 horsepower and above inventory to sales ratio very much in line with where we ended 2015. Even inclusive of those 6000 series tractors.","Certainly from a large Ag perspective we\u2019re expecting even a bit more of a decrease in that particular product. You know, again we work in a lot of ways on used equipment with our dealers. Certainly we leverage what we use as pool fund that provide availability to that dealer and again much of that is with the focus on the level of new equipment that they are willing to sell given the level of used. As you know, every new piece of equipment comes of the used trade. And so we do try to balance that and talk through that with our dealers. So -- but again, I think what you're seeing today in those inventories is largely some seasonality type of differences. So -- okay? Hopefully that gave you some additional color and we\u2019ll go ahead and move on to the next caller. Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mircea Dobre of Robert Baird. You may now ask your question.","Mircea Dobre","Good morning, everyone. Tony, if I may I\u2019d like to ask you a question on farm balance sheets. That\u2019s slide 40 of your presentation. And obviously based on that chart, things are looking pretty good. But if we're looking at farm balance sheets, land accounts for better than 80% of farm assets. We're starting to see some deterioration in cash ramps; we're starting to see some erosion in farmland values. So I guess my question is how do you think about the risk to farm balance sheets going forward? And most importantly can equipment demand eventually stabilize if land values continue to erode?","Tony Huegel","Yes, certainly you are seeing -\u2013 and you're seeing it really in that chart as well to your point, while relative to history those debt-to-equity ratios are still at pretty attractive levels and we would argue that farmers in general their balance sheets are pretty strong. They came into this downturn having come through a strong environment with balance sheets in good order. But you're seeing those creep up and some of that or a good portion of that is assets coming down and specifically land values. So you are seeing some of that and its coming down slowly.","We don\u2019t anticipate any kind of precipitous decline in land values, we're certainly not seeing signals of that. It\u2019s coming down but at moderate \u2013 modest-to-moderate pace. As a result financing ratios are creeping up a bit. But again, we don\u2019t sense any major financial upheaval in the farm sector at this point. Again, I would point out, also at these levels, while farmer profitability is significantly lower, broadly speaking, farmers are still profitable at these corn prices. And again, not that they aren\u2019t being pinched but are still being profitable.","So if corn prices stay at this level, I would point out as cash rent comes down that helps the profitability of most farmers as well. So there's a little bit of double-edged sword on those land values and in terms of the impact it has on farmers.","Tony Huegel ","Thank you. Appreciate the question and we\u2019ll move on to the next caller.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Kwame Webb of Morningstar. You may now ask your question.","Kwame Webb","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question today. I just want to get a little bit of expanded commentary on South America. So as I think about the two big things going on there particularly in Brazil, not only was there uncertainty around the rates but also it seemed like there was a little bit of a bottleneck in terms of turnaround time on those applications. So if you\u2019d kind of give some thoughts on that and then any early thoughts on your exposure to the Argentina market, as that seems to be opening up? Thanks so much.","Tony Huegel","Thank you and I appreciate the question, yes. Certainly as you think about Brazil I think I would still claim obviously is our outlook for South America did decline a bit on tractors and in combines. Things are still -\u2013 the market\u2019s still pretty tough there. But to your point there are -\u2013 have been a couple of signs recently of potential positives. Certainly the fact that FINAME financing rates have been announced while they\u2019re higher than what we've been at, they\u2019re still at very attractive levels for farmer customers\u2019 that point out below \u2013 continue to be below inflation.","So that is very helpful from that perspective. And actually in the short-term we point out could result in a little bit of a pull ahead. So farmers have until, I believe, its June 9th, to make their applications under the current rates before the rates move up those -\u2013 a couple of points. So again in the short-term we would expect to see some nice activity.","But again as Josh pointed out in the opening comments, a lot of that uncertainty around what will happen, will we even have a FINAME program, what's going to happen with down payment requirements, all those sorts of things that at least for the time being largely been alleviated. But we\u2019ll see as we move forward because there is still some uncertainty. I think again we\u2019re getting the sense that the agricultural community is viewing these changes positively but it is early and I would say the same thing in Argentina. Again some very positive changes for farmer customers, their ability to export their product, those sorts of things but it is still early. So we could potentially I suppose later in the year, you could see some benefit but I would argue most of that we would view as a 2017 opportunity versus the 2016 opportunity.","Kwame Webb","Thanks for the color.","Tony Huegel","You bet, thank you, next caller.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso of Evercore ISI. You may now ask your question.","David Raso","Hi, thank you. Really just a simple question if you look at the second half implied EPS that you adjusted for what second half usually is at the full year, we are sort of walking away from the call with the idea of the second half of the years implying annualized earnings power roughly around $3. To walk us away from that assumption can you help us a bit maybe with is production in the second half going to be well below retail, maybe help quantify what the pull forward was from 3Q and a 2Q so I can smooth it out and put it back into the second half, I am just trying to understand is that what we should be walking away with given where you\u2019re implying second half EPS?","Tony huegel ","Yeah, I mean when you think about net income in the back half you certainly as our guidance implies, our first half was stronger than the back half is forecasted to be. We have had some shifts in production. I mean broadly I can't necessarily say that that's been the case, but things like large tractors and there is obviously some relevance there. Year-over-year if you look at 2015, in the first half about 45% of our shipments occurred in the first half and 55% in the back half. 2016 that actually flips and again that was just the really more reflective of if that factory looked at the best way to line up the production for the year, that\u2019s what made the most sense for 2016.","So we are seeing a little bit of shift in some of those products as we move forward. Certainly as you look at construction, things aren't getting easier there and our forecast as we talked about last year does not look for the back half of the year to improve. And seasonally you\u2019ll see some sales increases but you are not going to see in our forecast anyway any anticipated lift in the overall market. So you don\u2019t get that benefit year-over-year those sorts of things. So again I think you are right in the sense that the back half is a bit lighter than the first half in our forecast.","Rajesh Kalathur","David, this is Raj I would not annualize the second half rather look at the full year. Quarter-to-quarter we have changes that can impact the full year and this time Tony said there was some pull ahead from the third quarter what would have been in the third quarter to the second quarter.","David Raso","That is why I am asking if you can help quantify it, I mean is the 300 million and that\u2019s roughly with a reasonable incremental margin, it was $0.16. I mean help us because if you don\u2019t help us it is what it is, it\u2019s the second half is usually 46% to 49% of the full year, that second half run rates implying like a $3.05 earnings power. But again if you help us with the pull forward say its $0.16 then it's more like implying a $3.35 annualized run rate. We\u2019re just trying to help understand is this how we should view the earnings power as the back half is telling us, or is production also well below retail in the second half. We\u2019re just trying to help frame it because otherwise it is what it is. It is implying $3.05 kind of annualized run rate?","Rajesh Kalathur","So David all I would say is taken the second half and annualizing it will not give you the right answer going forward. So you may want -\u2013 so we cannot really quantify it any more than that.","Tony Huegel","Unfortunately I think that\u2019s about all the further we\u2019re going to be able to go with that one. So we can take that offline later. Just go on to the next caller. Thanks David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Shlisky of Seaport Global. You may now ask your question.","Michael Shlisky","Good morning guys, I want to touch on your share buybacks. I haven't seen all that much thus far in 2016. I guess is it kind of safe to say that 2016 buybacks will be behind what we have seen in 2015, 2014 and could you update us possibly are these sort of cash out there that are a bit higher in your hierarchy that you're kind of holding on to cash flow now, are there any good deals out there, any new markets, etcetera.","Rajesh Kalathur","Mike, this is Raj. As you know cash use priorities remain the same. They\u2019ve not changed at all. So our single A is the highest priority and then we look at strategic options. And with respect to strategic growth options you\u2019ve seen us keep organic R&D spend at a pretty healthy rate and you\u2019ve also seen us announce some inorganic acquisitions. And you\u2019ve seen us talk about Precision Planting, Monosem, and more recently Heidi [ph]. So in this type of an industry environment where we have a very strong financial position, some of these inorganic options become more actionable for us. And if they are in the long-term interest of our shareholders for profitable growth in the long-term, we will act on some of those. And then dividends are our next priority and then finally share repurchases and we've always said share repurchases are a residual use of cash. And as you just mentioned we have higher \u2013- if there are higher priority uses, we apply it those. Now I won\u2019t say this with respect to share repurchases, we have also said we will do those only if it fits in the long-term interest of long-term shareholders. We still think it\u2019s very good value for long-term shareholders, but we want to first allocate cash for other higher priorities.","Tony Huegel","Okay. Thank you. Next caller.","Michael Shlisky","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer of Barclays. You may now ask your question.","Robert Wertheimer","Hi, thanks, good morning. Thanks for the question. The loss of the -\u2013 the charges or losses on leases, were that just on stuff that was turned in or did you change the depreciation assumption as well?","Tony Huegel","Yes, so there\u2019s both losses and impairments that we took on some of the items that were either an inventory or as well as some of the future leases. So we did look at some of the impairments. We basically looked out a year at lease maturities and took what we felt was the most applicable experience that we're seeing. Again as I mentioned earlier on the return rates that we're experiencing as well as the loss rates and apply those to that future lease maturity. I\u2019d point out to the extent that short \u2013- as we looked out a year to the extent that those short-term leases have been our largest challenge, we would have captured obviously the lions share of those short-term leases in that analysis that we took. And then as we evaluate and make changes going forward, the intent is to reduce that risk significantly on future short-term leases to the extent we do book any 12-month leases as we move forward.","Rajesh Kalathur","Rob, this is Raj. Let me just take a broader perspective on this. You know operating leases are only about 14% of our total portfolio. And then the impairments and losses have been concentrated in less than 20% of this 14%, okay? So this is primarily the less than 12 month and less leases. And you heard us talk about clearly taking significant steps to address this issue, lowered our residual values, we have significantly restricted the 12 month or less leases. But for those maturing in the next few quarters, now we've assumed recent loss rates and return rates and also forecasted that. We also, you heard from Tony, we\u2019re also actively working on limiting our loss rates and return rates for what\u2019s going to mature in the next few quarters. Now the other 86% of the GDF portfolio, we are forecasting we have about 23 basis points of loss provisions. So still a very good financial portfolio, especially given where the industry is or where all in the competitive environment is.","Tony Huegel","Okay. Thank you. Next caller.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher of UBS Securities. You may now ask your question.","Steven Fisher","Great, thanks. Good morning. On pricing in construction including the selling incentives I know you said is now expected to be down slightly for the year, really just trying to understand the trend in the second half versus what you are seeing in the fiscal second quarter, is that currency is maybe not as much of a competitive threat from some players as it was in the first half and I think some folks are expecting that to really help the pricing dynamic going forward. So as to what extent are you expecting pricing to get increasingly challenging in the second half versus just what you saw in the second quarter and are you stepping up restructuring to kind of mitigate that?","Tony Huegel","Yes, I think in relation to the pricing what we\u2019re looking at is really reflective of what we have seen in the marketplace to date from a competitive perspective. Certainly you would hope as we\u2019ve hoped all year that some of that competitive pressure would ease up a bit and others would be as focused on some positive price realization as we are. I would point out that isn't all about FX benefit in terms of the competitive pressures that we\u2019re seeing. Meaning it is not just people who are leveraging yen benefits specifically. And so I\u2019ll probably leave it at that but remember as the impact in the second quarter on price was greater than what you would see as a run rate going forward in the third and fourth quarter, simply because of the accrual that you have to make when you perceive higher levels of discount in the future because you now have to increase your accrual on all of the field inventory that\u2019s already been shipped in prior quarters. So again at quarter end what you see, the way the accounting works the quarter in which you see that higher level of incentives going forward does tend to take a more significant hit. And so that was the impact for construction in the second quarter.","And with that we\u2019ll move on to the next caller.","Steven Fisher","Thank you.","Tony Huegel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss of BMO Capital Markets. You may now ask your question.","Joel Tiss","Hi, how is it going. I am just going to glue two random ones together here. Can you just remind us what the mix in your C&F or the construction business is that you are still selling to rental? And I wonder also on the mix shift in Ag, is that partially deliberate because you guys are moving -- trying to move a little more into smaller Ag or is that just the market forces pushing things around?","Tony Huegel","Certainly from a construction perspective historically we would have said 15% to 20% of our sales go into rental. It would be on the lower -- actually below that range today and in terms of what's going to IRC. We have talked a lot about from a small large mix especially on the utility tractors. Our desire -- our compact utility tractors, our desire to improve market share there. But to be fair some of that\u2019s also market. The market is certainly not as weak on the small equipment as it would be on the large as we talked about in our guidance. So it is a bit of both, our desire to increase market share as well as the market shifting in that direction. Next caller.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Volkmann of Jeffries. You may now ask your question.","Stephen Volkmann","Hi, good morning. I only have one last kind of a philosophical question and I guess as I go through your appendix and look at what you guys are assuming for the backdrop here for the next year or so it is hard to make a case that there is much of a recovery likely going out over the next year or two and I am not really asking you to bless that forecast. So, I guess I am just trying to figure out kind of where are you in the cost control process and if next year were to be another down year would you be able to hold these decrementals around 30% or would they get worse and at what point do you kind of think about doing some real footprint reduction restructuring rather than just kind of headcount stuff? Thanks.","Tony Huegel","Yes, I mean I think and obviously it is pretty early to bless any forecast for 2017. But I would point out to your comment, I mean obviously the current forecast is pretty high. Corn crop to be planted, I am sure of a significant weather event that would impact production and I would argue that\u2019s a comment from really any of the key growing regions if you see a significant weather impact. We will continue to believe you would see a pretty responsive change in pricing and the environment could shift pretty quickly. But at this point that\u2019s primarily about weather and we\u2019re not going to make a call on weather at this point in the process.","So let\u2019s go with the assumption that you\u2019re seeing a flattish kind of environment. Let's go with I think your question was more about down. If you\u2019re talking about large Ag seeing another significant downturn, as we have talked about last year I mean it will be challenging for us given the levels we\u2019re at with our production capacity today it will be very difficult for us to maintain this level of decremental margin. Especially to the comment earlier of I think Adam asked about with steel pricing, as you start to get headwinds on some of the material cost, that adds pressure as well but even if all of those costs are those sort of external cost if you will remain flat, another significant downturn in large Ag would make it very difficult for us to maintain these low decremental margins.","Now I want to shift, it does not mean that we aren't continuing to look for ways that we can reduce cost. We talked before, we haven't done lot on R&D. If we continue to see a further weakening or even continue at these levels we would take a much harder look at those projects. Certainly from a SA&G perspective as well I would say clearly we\u2019re looking -- continuing to look at ways that we can streamline our processes and streamline our operations in order to reduce those costs. But the ability to do that at a level that would offset another significant step down in large Ag would not be likely.","Rajesh Kalathur","Steve, this is Raj let me add to what Tony said, and if you look at the longer-term demand for grains it is still in very good shape. So it\u2019s continuing to increase globally which is a positive signal for the long term for us. And as we look at the future, we have said if there is a change in our overall pieces in terms of long-term demand that would make us take some drastic changes in terms of our strategy. But we haven't seen that otherwise it is basically localized to weather. And we have said weather can impact that you have seen the prices come back -- core prices and especially soybean prices come back up sharply with just some of the weather scenarios in Argentina and Brazil.","Now with respect to your question on decrementals it clearly is going to depend on which part of the Ag or C&F segment goes down or goes up. So with a small Ag there is -- it is what you know more and more left with small Ag. If that goes down then our decrementals can be managed at the current levels or around the current levels. If it is going to be more on the large Ag it is going to be harder for us to manage but it is still going to be much better than in previous downturns, okay. And we do have continuing efforts in terms of structural cost reduction whether they be on a material cost side, overhead side, or SA&G side. So you will see us continuously work on those to offset any of these if the scenario of your -- should happen.","Stephen Volkmann","Thank you so much.","Tony Huegel","Okay, we\u2019ll have time for just one more caller please.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets. You may now ask your question.","Brendan Shea ","Hi, good morning, thanks for fitting in my question. This is Brendan Shea on for Seth. Just touching back on your sales composition, how much have recent acquisitions contributed to your current revenue and then how much do you have acquisitions baked into your estimates?","Tony Huegel ","As you think about acquisitions keep in mind in our forecast as a general rule we would not incorporate sales of an acquisition into our forecast until the point in which we actually close on those. So that would include, in this case Hagie and Monosem. So it would be a pretty small percentage. So, I would say it wouldn\u2019t be in rounding. You really wouldn\u2019t see it in the current forecast.","Tony Huegel","Alright, with that we will close the call. Again I appreciate all of your questions and participation and as always we will be around throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference, thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."]}}
